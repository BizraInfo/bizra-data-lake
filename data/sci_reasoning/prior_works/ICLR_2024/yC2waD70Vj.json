  "synthesis_narrative": "The reservoir computing line of work by Maass, Natschl\u00e4ger, and Markram introduced the fading memory framework for causal input\u2013output functionals, formalizing how influence of distant inputs should decay in stable sequence processing. Jaeger quantified this in Echo State Networks, showing that linear reservoirs express short-term memory with exponentially decaying contributions from the past, making precise the practical limitations of linear recurrent architectures. Manjunath and Jaeger further cemented the conceptual bridge between stability and memory by proving the equivalence of the echo state property and the fading memory property, connecting dynamical stability to input\u2013output decay. On the expressive side, Sch\u00e4fer and Zimmermann established universality of nonlinear RNNs for causal filters, and Grigoryeva and Ortega proved ESN universality on fading-memory filters under explicit stability conditions, offering sharp sufficiency results tied to stability. In parallel, DeVore, Hanin, and Petrova developed Bernstein-type inverse approximation theorems for neural networks, showing how structural properties of targets can be deduced from approximability assumptions. Complementing these theoretical insights, Tallec and Ollivier proposed time-scale-aware parameterizations that explicitly encode memory horizons in RNNs.\nTogether, these works reveal a gap: while stability-linked sufficiency for approximating fading memory filters is well understood, a necessity result for nonlinear RNNs was missing. The linear case indicated exponential decay, and inverse-approximation methodology suggested how to formalize it. Synthesizing these threads, the paper proves a Bernstein-type inverse theorem: stable nonlinear RNN approximation forces exponentially decaying memory, thus extending the linear curse of memory to the nonlinear regime and motivating a reparameterization that allocates explicit exponential time scales.",

    "abstract": "We prove an inverse approximation theorem for the approximation of nonlinear sequence-to-sequence relationships using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). This is a so-called Bernstein-type result in approximation theory, which deduces properties of a target function under the assumption that it can be effectively approximated by a hypothesis space. In particular, we show that nonlinear sequence relationships that can be stably approximated by nonlinear RNNs must have an exponential decaying memory structure - a notion that can be made precise. This extends the previously identified curse of memory in linear RNNs into the general nonlinear setting, and quantifies the essential limitations of the RNN architecture for learning sequential relationships with long-term memory. Based on the analysis, we propose a principled reparameterization method to overcome the limitations. Our theoretical results are confirmed by numerical experiments.",
