  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core idea\u2014quantifying and achieving replicability through list and certificate complexities\u2014draws on three converging threads: stability, geometric convexity, and certificate-based learning. Stability-based generalization (Bousquet\u2013Elisseeff) and reusable-holdout methodology (Dwork et al.) motivate relaxing exact replicability to notions that withstand sample variability while preserving statistical validity. This perspective clarifies why exact, single-output replicability is unattainable in general and frames list/certificate replicability as principled, achievable relaxations.\n\nOn the algorithmic side, the geometric structure of bias estimation in d dimensions is pivotal. Carath\u00e9odory\u2019s theorem guarantees any mean vector lies in the convex hull of at most d+1 extreme points, directly yielding a (d+1)-list replicable algorithm: independent runs can be funneled, with high probability, to hypotheses from a fixed small set approximating the population mean. Complementarily, Radon\u2019s theorem provides the matching lower bound, showing that lists of size d or smaller cannot universally represent all d-dimensional mean vectors, establishing optimal list complexity.\n\nThe certificate replicability notion is shaped by the sample-compression paradigm (Floyd\u2013Warmuth), where short certificates reconstruct hypotheses, aligning \u201ccertificate size\u201d with replicability guarantees. Finally, concentration inequalities (Hoeffding) deliver the sample complexity needed to confine empirical fluctuations so that outputs consistently fall within the prescribed list/certificate bounds. The broader strategy of using small lists to overcome impossibility is also informed by list-decodable learning (Charikar\u2013Steinhardt\u2013Valiant), reinforcing the paper\u2019s emphasis on minimizing list size without sacrificing accuracy.",
