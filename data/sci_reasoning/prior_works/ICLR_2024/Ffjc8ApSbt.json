  "synthesis_narrative": "Counterfactual Risk Minimization introduced inverse propensity scoring as a learning objective for logged bandit/implicit-feedback data, establishing the propensity-weighted risk that subsequent recommendation methods rely on. Recommendations as Treatments instantiated this idea for collaborative filtering, popularizing IPS/SNIPS-weighted matrix factorization and highlighting selection bias in observational feedback. Doubly Robust Policy Evaluation and Learning combined outcome modeling with propensity weighting to mitigate variance while preserving consistency, defining the DR estimators that many debiasing systems use. Balanced Policy Evaluation and Learning reframed off-policy error as worst-case loss over a function class and proposed RKHS/IPM-based balancing to control that error through explicit function-class matching. Kernel Balancing demonstrated that matching RKHS mean embeddings yields weights that balance an entire (potentially infinite) function class, providing a constructive kernel-based route to balance without specifying features. Kernel Optimal Matching operationalized this by solving convex programs that minimize RKHS imbalance subject to variance control. Minimax Weighting for Off-Policy Evaluation further showed that under partial coverage, IPS/DR bias is governed by imbalance over a chosen function class, emphasizing the need to pick and effectively balance that class.\nTaken together, these works expose a gap: propensity/DR methods in recommendation lack a principled answer to which functions must be balanced and how to achieve that balance efficiently during training. The present paper synthesizes the balance-based view with kernel methods, analyzing IPS/DR bias for finite-dimensional classes and then using RKHS mean-embedding matching to deliver universal, kernel-based causal balancing with adaptive updates in collaborative filtering training, a natural next step given these insights.",

    "abstract": "Collaborative filtering builds personalized models from the collected user feedback. However, the collected data is observational rather than experimental, leading to various biases in the data, which can significantly affect the learned model. To address this issue, many studies have focused on propensity-based methods to combat the selection bias by reweighting the sample loss, and demonstrate that\nbalancing is important for debiasing both theoretically and empirically. However, there are two questions that still need to be addressed: which function class should be balanced and how to effectively balance that function class? In this paper, we first perform theoretical analysis to show the effect of balancing finite-dimensional function classes on the bias of IPS and DR methods, and based on this, we propose a universal kernel-based balancing method to balance functions on the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. In addition, we propose a novel adaptive causal balancing method during the",
