  "synthesis_narrative": "Prevailing scaling-law work (Kaplan et al.) and compute-optimal training (Hoffmann et al.) entrenched the assumption that validation pre-training loss largely predicts downstream performance, making loss the de facto model-selection metric. This paper\u2019s central move is to hold that loss fixed and expose meaningful differences in downstream transfer, arguing that the optimization procedure\u2019s implicit bias selects among qualitatively different solutions. The theoretical backbone for this idea comes from the implicit-bias literature: Soudry et al. established that gradient descent, even without explicit regularization, converges to structured solutions (e.g., max-margin), and Lyu & Li demonstrated analogous margin-maximization behavior in deep homogeneous networks. These works motivate the paper\u2019s claim that pre-training algorithms can prefer more transferable models at the same loss. To explain what distinguishes these equal-loss solutions, the authors turn to the geometry\u2013generalization connection inaugurated by Keskar et al., who linked flatness to better generalization. Operationally, the paper leverages sharpness-aware training (Foret et al.\u2019s SAM) and other algorithmic choices to induce different flatness profiles while keeping pre-training loss matched, directly testing the implicit-bias hypothesis. Finally, robust flatness measurement practices (Li et al.\u2019s loss-landscape visualization and normalization) enable credible comparisons across models and training regimes. Together, these prior works shape a narrative: loss alone is insufficient; implicit algorithmic bias, reflected in flatness, is a key determinant of downstream transfer in language models.",
