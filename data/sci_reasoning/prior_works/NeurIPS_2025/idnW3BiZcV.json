  "synthesis_narrative": "CAR-Flow\u2019s core contribution is a condition-aware reparameterization that aligns source and target distributions via a lightweight learned shift, thereby shortening the probability path a flow/diffusion model must learn. This addresses a well-known limitation in DDPM-style and score-based models (Ho et al., Song et al.) where training begins from a condition-agnostic Gaussian; the model must both inject conditioning and perform mass transport. Prior conditioning strategies like classifier guidance (Dhariwal & Nichol) and classifier-free guidance (Ho & Salimans) inject condition during sampling, but still leave the base distribution misaligned, causing the vector field to shoulder unnecessary work.\n\nThe flow-matching and stochastic-interpolant literature (Albergo, Boffi, Vanden-Eijnden) provides the training formalism CAR-Flow builds upon: learning a vector field that transports a source to a target along an interpolant. CAR-Flow augments this with a learnable, condition-dependent shift of the source, the target, or both, which reduces the path length and simplifies the field the flow-matching loss must fit. Conceptually, this echoes EDM\u2019s preconditioning (Karras et al.), but applies it to conditional alignment rather than time/scale reparameterization, and it resonates with CVAE\u2019s conditional reparameterization of a Gaussian latent. Empirically, integrating this mechanism into modern ImageNet backbones such as DiT (Peebles & Xie) demonstrates faster training and improved FID, substantiating that moving conditional signal into the base distribution yields more efficient and accurate transport.",
