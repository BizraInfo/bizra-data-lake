  "synthesis_narrative": "FlexGen\u2019s core innovation\u2014high-throughput LLM generation on a single commodity GPU by aggregating GPU, CPU, and disk resources and by searching tensor placement/transfer patterns\u2014emerges from two converging lines of prior work. First, memory virtualization and offloading: vDNN introduced the fundamental idea of swapping and prefetching tensors between GPU and host memory under a carefully orchestrated schedule. The ZeRO family advanced this by demonstrating that large model states can be offloaded across CPU and even NVMe to break the GPU memory wall. However, ZeRO-Offload and ZeRO-Infinity primarily targeted training or multi-GPU settings and did not address the peculiarities of autoregressive decoding (notably, the fast-growing attention cache) nor the needs of single-GPU, throughput-oriented serving. FlexGen explicitly addresses these gaps by extending offload to disk and by modeling the inference pipeline to choose optimal placements and overlaps via a linear program, an approach inspired by Alpa\u2019s cost-model-based planning. Second, precision reduction for LLM inference: LLM.int8 validated that substantial weight compression preserves quality, and GPTQ showed accurate post-training 4-bit quantization for GPT-style models. FlexGen builds on and extends this trajectory by compressing both weights and the attention KV cache to 4-bit, directly attacking the dominant memory and I/O bottlenecks in batched decoding. Against practical baselines like DeepSpeed-Inference, these combined ideas enable FlexGen to unlock larger batches and higher throughput without multiple high-end accelerators.",
