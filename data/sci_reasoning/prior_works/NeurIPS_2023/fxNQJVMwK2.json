  "synthesis_narrative": "Clark and Jaini\u2019s core insight\u2014turning a text-to-image diffusion model into a zero-shot classifier by comparing denoising losses conditioned on label prompts\u2014rests on two intertwined threads: the denoising\u2013likelihood connection and the advent of strong text-conditioned diffusion backbones. The denoising objective from DDPM provides a variational view in which per-timestep denoising losses relate to log-likelihood, while Vincent\u2019s denoising-score matching result explains why denoising residuals carry information about the data (and class-conditional) log-density. Practical refinements from Improved DDPM stabilize epsilon prediction and timestep weighting, making those denoising losses meaningful and comparable across labels.\n\nOn the modeling side, the leap in semantic conditioning from Latent Diffusion (Stable Diffusion) and Imagen supplies high-fidelity, text-grounded denoisers; their cross-attention conditioning and large language encoders enable accurate label semantics and attribute binding\u2014capabilities the new method exploits when scoring labels. Dhariwal and Nichol\u2019s classifier guidance tightly couples diffusion with classification by training classifiers on noised data to guide generation; Clark and Jaini invert that relationship, using the generative model\u2019s own denoising scores to perform classification without any classifier. Finally, CLIP establishes the modern template for zero-shot evaluation via text prompts, serving both as a conceptual anchor and a strong baseline. Together, these works directly enable the paper\u2019s contribution: a principled, practical procedure that repurposes text-to-image diffusion models as competitive zero-shot classifiers, while revealing advantages in shape bias and attribute binding over contrastive approaches.",
