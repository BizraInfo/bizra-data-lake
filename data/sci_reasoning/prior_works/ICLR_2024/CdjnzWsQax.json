  "synthesis_narrative": "Matrix-profile-based motif discovery established that recurring subsequences in time series can be surfaced robustly using z-normalized similarity, enabling identification of repeated patterns independent of absolute amplitude and tolerant to local misalignment. Complementing this, k-Shape introduced a shape-based distance with z-normalization that clusters subsequences by their underlying shape while being invariant to scale and phase, offering a practical way to represent motif classes without being tied to raw magnitudes. In generative modeling for time series, diffusion methods provided a powerful likelihood-based alternative: DDPM formalized a forward\u2013reverse noising process and objective for high-fidelity sample synthesis, while CSDI demonstrated that score-based diffusion can be adapted to time series specifically, conditioning on observed portions to model complex dynamics. In finance, Hamilton\u2019s regime-switching framework emphasized that temporal dynamics transition among latent states with distinct persistence, motivating explicit modeling of transitions and durations. Meanwhile, TimeGAN became the de facto baseline for synthetic time-series generation but typically assumes regular sampling and does not natively capture variable-duration, scale-invariant motifs.\nTogether, these works revealed both the ingredients and the gap: robust discovery of scale-invariant motifs (matrix profile, k-Shape), a generative mechanism capable of high-fidelity segment synthesis (DDPM/CSDI), and a principled view of state transitions over time (regime switching), while existing generators like TimeGAN underperformed on irregular, multiscale financial patterns. The paper synthesizes these strands by first extracting scale- and duration-agnostic motifs, then training a diffusion model to generate motif segments, and finally learning a transition mechanism over motif types to stitch segments into coherent financial series\u2014an evident next step given the limitations and insights of the prior literature.",

    "abstract": "Limited data availability poses a major obstacle in training deep learning models for financial applications. Synthesizing financial time series to augment real-world data is challenging due to the irregular and scale-invariant patterns uniquely associated with financial time series - temporal dynamics that repeat with varying duration and magnitude. Such dynamics cannot be captured by existing approaches, which often assume regularity and uniformity in the underlying data. We develop a novel generative framework called FTS-Diffusion to model irregular and scale-invariant patterns that consists of three modules. First, we develop a scale-invariant pattern recognition algorithm to extract recurring patterns that vary in duration and magnitude. Second, we construct a diffusion-based generative network to synthesize segments of patterns. Third, we model the temporal transition of patterns in order to aggregate the generated segments. Extensive experiments show that FTS-Diffusion generates",
