  "synthesis_narrative": "FedGVI sits at the intersection of distributed Bayesian inference and robust variational objectives. Its federated architecture and message-passing mechanics directly extend Partitioned Variational Inference, retaining the partitioned/site view and cavity distribution while broadening the update class beyond standard KL-based VI. This generalization is enabled by Generalized Variational Inference and the generalized Bayes framework of Bissiri et al., which justify replacing likelihood-based objectives with proper scoring rules or divergence-robust losses. These foundations provide FedGVI with calibrated uncertainty and robustness to both likelihood and prior misspecification, addressing a key shortcoming of conventional Bayesian and frequentist FL.\n\nOn the algorithmic side, FedGVI leverages the conjugate-computation insights of CVI to translate generalized, potentially nonconjugate local objectives into tractable conjugate updates, thereby lowering client-side computational burden and communication cost. The paper\u2019s analysis of cavity optimality and fixed-point convergence traces to Expectation Propagation, whose cavity/tilted constructs guide FedGVI\u2019s site updates and theoretical guarantees; FedGVI adapts these constructs to generalized objectives. Finally, the Bayesian Committee Machine\u2019s product-of-experts view provides the principled blueprint for composing client contributions into a coherent global posterior via cavity corrections, now executed under generalized VI losses. Together, these works yield a federated probabilistic framework that unifies partitioned/distributed inference with robust generalized Bayes, offering both theoretical robustness under misspecification and practical, conjugate updates suitable for heterogeneous federated environments.",
