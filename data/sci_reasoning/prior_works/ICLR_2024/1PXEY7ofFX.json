  "synthesis_narrative": "Score-based generative modeling cast sampling as integrating a probability flow ODE tied to a learned score, revealing that accurate generation demands many function evaluations. Flow matching then trained generative models as deterministic ODEs with explicit velocity fields, making the sampling path fully defined and amenable to principled numerical discretization. Dedicated diffusion solvers such as DPM-Solver introduced high-order designs based on the ODE\u2019s structure, while UniPC provided a unified predictor\u2013corrector family enforcing order conditions and stability, and PNDM employed multi-step formulas with fixed coefficients to reduce error. Karras and colleagues showed that even simple schemes like Euler/Heun, when paired with carefully tuned discretization schedules, can dramatically shift the quality\u2013speed tradeoff, underscoring the sensitivity of performance to solver design. In parallel, progressive distillation compressed many-step samplers into few steps by retraining the entire network, achieving speedups but at substantial compute cost and occasional fidelity loss.\n\nTogether, these works exposed a clear opportunity: solvers strongly influence sample quality, yet most are model-agnostic and hand-crafted, while distillation is expensive. The natural next step is to leverage the determinism of flow/probability-flow ODEs and the order theory of numerical methods to learn a tiny, order-consistent solver customized to a specific pre-trained model. By optimizing solver coefficients and step allocations directly on the model\u2019s ODE while enforcing classical order constraints, bespoke solvers inherit theoretical correctness and deliver large NFE reductions without retraining the generative network.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion or flow-based models are powerful generative paradigms that are notoriously hard to sample as samples are defined as solutions to high-dimensional Ordinary or Stochastic Differential Equations (ODEs/SDEs) which require a large Number of Function Evaluations (NFE) to approximate well. Existing methods to alleviate the costly sampling process include model distillation and designing dedicated ODE solvers. However, distillation is costly to train and sometimes can deteriorate quality, while dedicated solvers still require relatively large NFE to produce high quality samples. In this paper we introduce ``Bespoke solvers'', a novel framework for constructing custom ODE solvers tailored to the ODE of a given pre-trained flow model. Our approach optimizes an order consistent and parameter-efficient solver (e.g., with 80 learnable parameters), is trained for roughly 1\\% of the GPU time required for training the pre-trained model, and significantly improves approximation and generatio",
