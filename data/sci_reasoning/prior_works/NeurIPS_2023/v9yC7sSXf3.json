  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014proving that deep neural collapse (DNC) is the unique global optimum in a deep unconstrained features model (UFM) for binary classification\u2014directly builds on the progression from empirical discovery to rigorous UFM theory. Papyan, Han, and Donoho (2020) crystallized neural collapse (NC) through NC1\u2013NC4, defining the geometric targets (simplex ETF class means, within-class collapse, and classifier-feature alignment). Han, Papyan, and Donoho (2022) then introduced the UFM and proved that under MSE loss the global optimizer satisfies NC, effectively turning the phenomenon into an optimality statement at the last layer. Mixon, Parshall, and Villar (2022) extended this optimality perspective to cross-entropy, reinforcing that ETF-like solutions arise broadly in UFM, thus strengthening the loss-agnostic geometric intuition leveraged by deep generalizations.\nConcurrently, simplified models such as the layer-peeled model (Fang et al., 2021) provided evidence and motivation that collapse can propagate to earlier layers, while results on implicit bias toward max-margin solutions in homogeneous networks (Lyu & Li, 2019) supported the geometric alignment picture underlying collapse. Classical ETF theory (Strohmer & Heath, 2003) supplies the precise mathematical structure used to characterize optimal solutions. Finally, analyses of deep linear networks (e.g., Tirer & Bruna, 2022) showed layerwise collapse in linear settings, spotlighting the remaining theoretical gap: deep non-linear networks. The present paper closes this gap by generalizing UFM to multiple non-linear layers and proving that the unique global optimum exhibits full DNC, thereby unifying empirical observations with a rigorous multi-layer optimality principle.",
