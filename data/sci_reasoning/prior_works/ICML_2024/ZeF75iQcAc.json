  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core insight\u2014that optimal acceleration for minimax and fixed\u2011point problems is not unique\u2014rests on two converging lines of work. First, the anchoring idea originates with Halpern\u2019s 1967 iteration for nonexpansive mappings, which inspired modern anchor\u2011based accelerated algorithms for fixed\u2011point and saddle\u2011point/VI problems. Within the operator\u2011theoretic minimax/VI paradigm established by Nemirovski\u2019s Mirror\u2011Prox, the community crystallized the oracle models and near\u2011optimal targets (e.g., Lin\u2013Jin\u2013Jordan). Crucially, matching first\u2011order complexity lower bounds (e.g., Diakonikolas et al.) certified that recently proposed anchor\u2011based accelerated methods are optimal, seemingly elevating anchoring to a unique mechanism for optimal acceleration. The second line is structural: the H\u2011duality framework (Ryu et al.) reveals dual relationships among first\u2011order operator methods. This paper marries these threads by using H\u2011duality to construct algorithms that are dual to the anchor\u2011based optimal methods for fixed\u2011point and minimax problems. The resulting H\u2011dual algorithms provably attain the same lower\u2011bound\u2011optimal worst\u2011case rates as the anchor\u2011based baselines (Kim et al.; Yoon et al.) without employing the anchoring mechanism, thereby demonstrating that optimal acceleration mechanisms are not unique. This reframes the design space: rather than a single canonical acceleration (anchoring), there exists a family of provably optimal yet behaviorally distinct methods connected via H\u2011duality.",
