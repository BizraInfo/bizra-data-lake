  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014extracting low-dimensional motifs that specify which neuronal populations participate, the direction of signal flow among them, and how these signals evolve over time\u2014arises at the intersection of three prior lines of work. First, latent trajectory models such as GPFA and LFADS established how to recover smooth single-trial, time-varying population activity. These works underpin the present framework\u2019s ability to capture within- and across-trial temporal structure in a low-dimensional space. Second, interpretability and selective participation across datasets trace to Group Factor Analysis and demixing principles (dPCA). GFA introduced the crucial idea that each latent can be active only in a subset of groups, directly mirrored here by assigning each latent dimension to a specific subset of neuronal populations; dPCA\u2019s demixing ethos further motivates interpretable axes that separate overlapping influences. Third, the concept of low-dimensional interareal coupling from the communication subspace (Semedo et al., 2019) provides the blueprint for studying interactions between populations, which this work scales beyond pairs to multiple populations and concurrent motifs. Finally, the classic notion of directed influence from Granger causality informs how the framework embeds directionality into latent dynamics, yielding an interpretable account of feedforward and feedback signaling. Together, these strands yield a unified, scalable dimensionality-reduction approach that uncovers concurrent, directed signaling motifs across multiple neuronal populations, validated on V1\u2013V2\u2013V3d recordings.",
