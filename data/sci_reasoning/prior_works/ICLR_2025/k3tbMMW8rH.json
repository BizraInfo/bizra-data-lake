  "synthesis_narrative": "Flow Matching introduced the idea of training transport maps by matching vector fields along chosen interpolants, showing that paired correspondences can yield scalable training for generative flows. Conditional Flow Matching removed the need for explicit pairings by matching conditional velocities, but the cost and complexity of sampling and estimating these conditionals made the approach computationally heavy in large-scale settings. Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge Sampling established a practical, fully unsupervised bridge-based route between distributions using the Schr\u00f6dinger problem and entropic OT, but it inherits high computational burden due to repeated coupling or score estimation without supervision. The Sinkhorn-regularized entropic OT framework made static optimal transport tractable and differentiable, enabling learnable couplings via efficient matrix scaling. From a control-theoretic lens, Schr\u00f6dinger bridges are stochastic optimal control problems with state-feedback drifts, suggesting that external information can be injected as feedback to steer transport. Finally, optimal transport for domain adaptation showed that side information (labels or partial correspondences) can be incorporated as regularization to bias couplings toward desired alignments.\nBringing these strands together created a natural opportunity: retain the scalability of paired matching while avoiding the impracticality of fully supervised pairings, and cut the cost of fully unsupervised SB. FSBM synthesizes this by casting bridge learning as a static EOT with a targeted feedback term derived from a small set of pre-aligned pairs and interpreting this as state feedback in the SB control view. This semi-supervised coupling guides non-coupled samples, preserving efficiency while requiring only minimal supervision.",

On the other hand, imposing full supervision of the matching process with optimal pairings improves scalability, however, it can be infeasible in most applications.\nTo strike a balance between scalability and minimal supervision, we introduce Feedback Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge Matching (FSBM), a novel semi-supervised matching framework that incorporates a small portion ($<8$% of the entire dataset) of pre-aligned pairs as state feedback to guide the transport map of non-coupled samples, thereby significantly improving efficiency. This is achieved by formulating a static Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem with an additional term capturing the ",
