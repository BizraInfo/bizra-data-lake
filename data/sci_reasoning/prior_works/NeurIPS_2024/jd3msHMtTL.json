  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014proving that DPP-based coresets can be fundamentally smaller than those from independent sampling\u2014rests on marrying negative dependence theory for determinantal processes with the coreset uniform-approximation framework. Foundational results by Lyons established discrete DPPs and variance properties for linear statistics, while Borcea\u2013Br\u00e4nd\u00e9n\u2013Liggett\u2019s strong Rayleigh theory and Pemantle\u2013Peres\u2019s concentration for SR measures supplied the machinery to translate repulsion into sub-Gaussian control of Lipschitz functionals. Bardenet\u2013Hardy then demonstrated in Monte Carlo settings that DPP sampling contracts variance and sharpens concentration for linear statistics; the present work generalizes this beyond a single functional to uniform control over parameterized loss families, which is the essence of coreset guarantees.\n\nWithin the coreset literature, Feldman\u2013Langberg formalized uniform loss approximation and provided i.i.d.-based baselines. The current paper improves these baselines by exploiting stronger-than-i.i.d. concentration arising from negative dependence. Classical results such as Serfling\u2019s inequalities for sampling without replacement highlight how dependence can aid concentration; the authors push this further using strong Rayleigh/DPP structure to obtain strictly tighter deviation bounds relevant to empirical risk. Finally, the line of work on volume sampling (Deshpande\u2013Rademacher) offered concrete evidence that DPP-type negative dependence can outperform independent sampling in subset selection for matrix problems; the new paper abstracts and extends this advantage to general coreset construction, settling the open question of cardinality improvements for DPP-based coresets via principled concentration of DPP linear statistics.",
