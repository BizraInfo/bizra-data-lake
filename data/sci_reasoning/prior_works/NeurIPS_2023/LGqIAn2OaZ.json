  "synthesis_narrative": "DEMOTE\u2019s core contribution\u2014estimating dynamic embeddings for tensor entities via a neural diffusion\u2013reaction process on a multi-partite graph\u2014sits at the intersection of three lines of work. First, probabilistic tensor and matrix factorization for sparse data (Schein et al., 2015; Charlin et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2016) established that temporal structure and appropriate likelihoods are crucial when observations are sparse and time-stamped. These works introduced temporal priors or autoregressive regularization to encourage smooth factor evolution, but relied on hand-crafted dynamics and did not explicitly couple entities through observed interaction structure.\nSecond, graph-based recommendation and diffusion methods (van den Berg et al., 2018; Klicpera et al., 2019) showed that constructing graphs from observations and propagating information over these graphs is an effective remedy for sparsity. DEMOTE generalizes the bipartite user\u2013item graph to a multi-partite graph induced by tensor entries and replaces discrete GCN-style layers with continuous diffusion, allowing correlated entities across modes to co-evolve.\nThird, continuous-time neural dynamics (Chen et al., 2018; Rubanova et al., 2019) provided the machinery to learn trajectories from irregular, sparse temporal signals. DEMOTE instantiates this by using a neural reaction term per entity to capture idiosyncratic evolution, while a graph diffusion term captures shared trends across related entities. By fusing temporal factorization, graph diffusion, and neural ODEs, DEMOTE yields a principled, data-driven dynamic tensor decomposition that captures both commonalities and personalities in entity evolution under extreme sparsity.",
