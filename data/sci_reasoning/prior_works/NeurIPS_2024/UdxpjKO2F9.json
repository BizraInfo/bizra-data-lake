  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014CENIE, a coverage-based evaluation of environment novelty for UED\u2014emerges at the intersection of regret-driven curricula and open-ended diversity-driven design. PAIRED formalized UED with regret as the central curriculum signal, yielding progressively harder environments but often overlooking novelty, which this work targets explicitly. From the open-ended learning side, POET demonstrated that sustained progress and zero-shot robustness require explicitly searching for novel environments, foreshadowing the need to measure diversity independently of task performance. Foundationally, Novelty Search introduced behavior-space novelty as an objective orthogonal to reward, establishing the conceptual distinction CENIE operationalizes within UED. MAP-Elites then provided a concrete, quantitative lens on diversity\u2014coverage across a descriptor space\u2014directly inspiring CENIE\u2019s coverage-based quantification that remains agnostic to underspecified environment parameters. Complementarily, GoalGAN showed that balancing difficulty with novelty produces stronger curricula, reinforcing the paper\u2019s argument that regret alone is insufficient. Finally, Procgen crystallized the evaluation imperative: agents must generalize to unseen, procedurally generated environments, a setting where better novelty measurement should translate to performance gains. Together, these works directly shaped CENIE\u2019s design: a principled, coverage-oriented novelty metric that augments regret to produce curricula that are not only challenging but also diverse, thereby improving generalization.",
