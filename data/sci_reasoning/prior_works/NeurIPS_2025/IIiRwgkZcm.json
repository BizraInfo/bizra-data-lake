  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s central contribution\u2014a non-asymptotic sample complexity bound for Bayesian recovery that is governed by the prior\u2019s intrinsic complexity (via an approximate covering number) and concentration properties of the forward operator and noise\u2014sits at the intersection of three lines of prior work. First, the Bayesian inverse problems framework of Stuart (2010) established well-posedness and stability of posteriors, while Knapik\u2013van der Vaart\u2013van Zanten (2011) showed how contraction rates in linear inverse problems depend on prior regularity and noise, setting the template that operator/noise properties should drive recovery guarantees. Second, the general posterior contraction theory of Ghosal\u2013Ghosh\u2013van der Vaart (2000) developed entropy/testing tools that tie recovery to covering numbers, and Kleijn\u2013van der Vaart (2006) extended this perspective to misspecified settings\u2014both directly informing the paper\u2019s use of an approximate covering number to capture prior complexity under approximate priors. Third, deterministic guarantees for inverse problems with deep generative priors (Bora et al., 2017; Hand & Voroninski, 2018) introduced covering-number/S-REC arguments and concentration for random measurement operators, yielding sample complexity that scales with latent dimension. The present work unifies these strands: it elevates the covering-number view to a Bayesian, non-asymptotic setting with general priors (including DNN pushforwards) and plugs in modern concentration tools (e.g., Vershynin, 2018) for broad forward operators and noise. As a result, it generalizes deterministic generative-prior results to posterior sampling and proves log-linear scaling in latent dimension for DNN-based priors within a principled Bayesian framework.",
