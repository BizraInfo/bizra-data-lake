  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core idea\u2014preserving pretrained, high-rank visual knowledge while learning fake-specific cues in a complementary, orthogonal subspace\u2014sits at the intersection of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, anti-collapse representation learning, and the recognized generalization challenges in AI-generated image detection. Early evidence that detectors overfit and fail to generalize across generators (Wang et al., 2020) motivates a strategy that resists specialization to narrow, spurious fake patterns. Foundation models like CLIP demonstrated that pretrained visual features transfer robustly; the present work aims to retain such generalizable structure by freezing the principal components of the feature space. The mechanism draws directly on the PEFT lineage: Adapters and LoRA showed that adaptation can be confined to restricted subspaces or low-rank updates while freezing the backbone, thereby avoiding overwriting core knowledge. Complementing this, EWC framed knowledge preservation as selectively constraining important parameters during fine-tuning; here, the constraint is geometrically realized by an SVD-based decomposition that locks principal directions. Finally, the diagnosis and prevention of representational collapse from self-supervised learning (e.g., VICReg) provide the representational rationale: maintaining variance along many directions combats low-rank collapse and improves expressivity. By combining SVD-driven subspace separation with the PEFT philosophy of non-destructive adaptation, the paper offers a principled way to protect high-variance, generalizable features while learning discriminative fake patterns in the orthogonal complement\u2014addressing the asymmetry and rank-deficiency at the heart of generalization failures in AIGI detection.",
