  "synthesis_narrative": "ND-SDF\u2019s core idea\u2014a learnable normal deflection field that measures and compensates for angular deviation between scene normals and prior normals\u2014sits squarely on the neural implicit surface rendering lineage while directly addressing the pitfalls of prior-driven supervision. NeuS and VolSDF provide the essential foundation: they formalize how to render from SDFs and recover accurate surface normals within a differentiable pipeline, which ND-SDF uses to supervise and propagate its deflection signal while preserving SDF validity. IGR contributes the SDF regularization perspective (eikonal constraint) that ensures ND-SDF\u2019s normals and deflection adjustments remain geometrically coherent and smooth.\n\nThe closest predecessor and primary baseline is MonoSDF, which demonstrated the promise of leveraging monocular depth/normal priors for indoor reconstruction but applied these priors uniformly across samples. This uniform enforcement can over-smooth detailed regions and bias geometry where priors are inaccurate\u2014precisely the failure mode ND-SDF is designed to overcome. ND-SDF replaces fixed prior penalties with a learned deflection field that adapts trust in the priors per sample and per region, enabling smooth walls/floors while preserving fine geometric details. UNISURF further set the precedent for coupling implicit surfaces with rendering-based supervision, which ND-SDF follows to integrate deflection-aware normal supervision. Finally, RegNeRF\u2019s use of external priors to stabilize reconstruction highlights the gap ND-SDF fills: instead of static weighting, ND-SDF learns the discrepancy itself (angular deflection), turning prior information from a rigid constraint into an adaptive, sample-specific guidance signal.",
