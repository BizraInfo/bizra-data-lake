  "synthesis_narrative": "Orient Anything V2\u2019s core advances\u2014handling rotational symmetries, predicting relative rotations, and scaling data\u2014arise from a synthesis of ideas across pose learning, rotation representation, and 3D asset creation. The immediate precursor, Orient Anything (V1), supplied the canonical front-face formulation and single-image orientation framework that V2 generalizes to 0\u2013N valid fronts and paired-image relative rotations. To robustly model symmetric objects, PoseCNN\u2019s ShapeMatch-Loss provided the template for symmetry-aware supervision, pushing V2 toward a periodic, symmetry-consistent objective that admits multiple plausible orientations. Stable rotation regression in V2 is grounded in continuous rotation parameterization and geodesic training principles from Zhou et al., which also inform its distribution fitting on SO(3).\nOn the data side, V2\u2019s scalable 3D asset strategy combines the breadth and category diversity exemplified by Objaverse with generative synthesis popularized by DreamFusion, enabling systematic coverage and balance across long-tail categories. For learning relative rotations directly from image pairs, DeepIM\u2019s iterative relative pose update design and classic CNN-based relative pose estimation (Melekhov et al.) both shape V2\u2019s multi-frame architecture, favoring direct relative-rotation prediction over post-hoc differencing of absolute poses. Together, these works converge to enable V2\u2019s unified treatment of orientation and rotation: symmetry-aware supervision that models periodicity, a data engine that scales with generative 3D assets, and a paired-image pathway for relative rotations\u2014all while retaining the practical, category-agnostic ethos introduced by V1.",
