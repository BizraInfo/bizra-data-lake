  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core advances trace directly to three lines of prior work: flow-based training objectives, perceptual noise allocation, and multimodal transformer backbones in latent space. Flow Matching formalized learning vector fields along probability paths, while Rectified Flow specialized this to straight-line paths between noise and data; the present work adopts rectified flow as its generative formulation and focuses on making it practical and superior at scale. On the training side, Karras et al. (EDM) showed that perceptual quality hinges on how noise scales are sampled and weighted, and Min-SNR further emphasized privileging low-noise regimes. Building on these insights, the authors introduce a perceptually biased noise-sampling strategy tailored to rectified flow, addressing a key gap: prior RF training largely used simple or uniform schedules not aligned with human perception. Architecturally, Latent Diffusion made high-resolution text-to-image feasible via a latent autoencoder, and DiT established a scalable transformer backbone in this setting. PixArt-\u03b1\u2019s MMDiT blocks then enabled explicit, bidirectional interactions between text and image tokens with separate modality parameters. Extending these ideas, the current paper proposes a transformer with separate weights for text and image and bidirectional fusion, integrated with rectified flow. Together, these works directly enabled the paper\u2019s two pillars: perceptually grounded RF training and a scalable multimodal RF-transformer for high-resolution synthesis.",
