  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation\u2014efficient, brute-force-free listing of all MAGs in a Markov equivalence class\u2014rests on a sequence of advances in the theory of ancestral graphs and equivalence-class traversal. Richardson and Spirtes (2002) established MAGs and m-separation, defining the graphical objects and independences that must be preserved during enumeration. Building on this, Ali, Richardson, and Spirtes (2009) provided the precise graphical conditions for Markov equivalence among MAGs (e.g., via discriminating paths), which directly constrain what local changes are permissible without leaving the MEC. The FCI framework and PAG representation from Spirtes, Glymour, and Scheines (2000) supply the practical starting point\u2014an equivalence-class summary\u2014motivating a procedure that instantiates all consistent MAGs. Zhang (2008) then delivered complete orientation rules for PAGs in the presence of latent confounders and selection variables; the present work extends this rule-based paradigm into vertex-local transformation rules that are proven sound and complete for MAG listing. Methodologically, the paper draws inspiration from Chickering\u2019s (1995) transformational characterization for DAGs, generalizing the idea of traversing an equivalence class via local, equivalence-preserving moves to the richer MAG setting. Analogous DAG results\u2014such as Andersson, Madigan, and Perlman\u2019s (1997) essential-graph characterization and He, Jia, and Yu\u2019s (2015) efficient enumeration/sampling\u2014exposed a conspicuous gap: while DAG MECs could be efficiently listed, no such method existed for MAGs. The ICML 2024 paper closes this gap by formalizing and validating the necessary local transformations and recursion for MAGs, including latent and selection variables.",
