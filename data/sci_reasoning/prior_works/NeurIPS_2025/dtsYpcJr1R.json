  "synthesis_narrative": "Arith-DAS fuses differentiable architecture search with graph-structured circuit modeling to optimize arithmetic interconnects at fine granularity. DARTS contributes the core recipe\u2014continuous relaxation of discrete choices on a DAG and bilevel optimization\u2014which Arith-DAS repurposes to parameterize and train interconnect edges against QoR signals. To convert inherently discrete wiring decisions into a gradient-friendly form, the Gumbel-Softmax estimator enables soft edge selection that anneals toward binary connectivity. Because circuit netlists must remain acyclic, NOTEARS\u2019 smooth acyclicity constraint provides a principled way to enforce DAG validity while learning edges.\nNeural Relational Inference supplies a blueprint for differentiable edge prediction within message passing: Arith-DAS adapts this paradigm from physical interaction graphs to circuit netlists, coupling edge inference with hardware-centric objectives (timing, area, power). Circuits are multi-relational by nature; R-GCN informs relation-specific message passing so that different interconnect types and timing classes are encoded with distinct parameters during search. Beyond mechanism, Franceschi et al.\u2019s bilevel graph structure learning clarifies how to separate structural variables (edges) from model weights and introduces sparsity/regularization strategies that encourage compact, high-quality topologies.\nFinally, Mirhoseini and colleagues demonstrate that L2O on chip design graphs can outperform heuristics when optimized directly for physical metrics, motivating Arith-DAS\u2019 shift away from proxy models toward end-to-end, differentiable optimization over real circuit QoR. Together, these works crystallize into Arith-DAS: differentiable edge prediction on a multi-relational DAG for high-performance arithmetic interconnect design.",
