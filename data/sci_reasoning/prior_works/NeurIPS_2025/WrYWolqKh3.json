  "synthesis_narrative": "The core contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that instruction-tuned, subword-based LMs are surprisingly robust to non-canonical tokenizations\u2014often unseen during training\u2014and that deliberately moving to character-level segmentation at inference can improve string manipulation and code tasks. This builds on the modern subword paradigm inaugurated by Sennrich et al. (BPE), which made deterministic, canonical tokenization the default, and on GPT-2\u2019s byte-level BPE, which crucially enables any string to be represented through many valid segmentations, including per-character encodings, using the same vocabulary.\nSubword regularization lines of work (Kudo; Provilkov et al.) established that training with randomized or sampled segmentations improves generalization and robustness. The present study departs by showing strong robustness even without such training, quantifying performance retention across random and character-level tokenizations, and relating degradation to distance from the canonical segmentation.\nIn parallel, tokenization-free models (ByT5; CANINE) and character-aware encoders (CharacterBERT) demonstrated that byte/character-level processing can confer robustness to noise and advantages on tasks requiring fine-grained string reasoning. Rather than redesigning the architecture or retraining, this paper reveals that similar benefits can be elicited from existing instruction-tuned LMs by simply retokenizing inputs, leveraging byte-level BPE\u2019s representational flexibility. Together, these works converge on a unifying insight: segmentation is a controllable interface that materially affects LM behavior, and non-canonical segmentations can be exploited at inference to trade off robustness and task performance without modifying the model.",
