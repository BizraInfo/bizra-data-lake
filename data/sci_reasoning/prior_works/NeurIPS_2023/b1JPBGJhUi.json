  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core insight\u2014that linear interpolation stabilizes nonconvex\u2013nonconcave training by inducing nonexpansive dynamics\u2014stands on classic fixed-point and monotone operator theory. Mann\u2019s averaged iteration provides the exact template for interpolating current parameters with an operator step so that the resulting mapping is averaged/nonexpansive, enabling robust fixed\u2011point convergence. Rockafellar\u2019s proximal point algorithm contributes the structural backbone: its firmly nonexpansive resolvent ensures stability for variational inequalities, and RAPP is designed as a relaxed, approximate PPA that preserves this stability while remaining single\u2011call per iteration. Eckstein\u2013Bertsekas\u2019s analysis of inexact/relaxed PPA and splitting legitimizes approximate inner solves and facilitates the paper\u2019s extensions to constrained and regularized problems.\n\nBauschke\u2013Combettes consolidates the nonexpansive/averaged operator toolkit and monotonicity notions the authors deploy to prove last\u2011iterate convergence under \u03c1\u2011(co)monotone conditions\u2014weakening requirements to \u03c1 > \u22121/(2L). Against classical stabilization like Korpelevich\u2019s extragradient\u2014reliant on two operator evaluations\u2014the proposed interpolation\u2011based design delivers a 1\u2011SCLI method with last\u2011iterate rates. On the algorithmic front, the work connects directly to practical interpolation schemes: it reinterprets and rigorously grounds the Lookahead optimizer within the RAPP framework, establishing convergence even with plain GDA in cohypomonotone regimes. Finally, in the broader context of game optimization, optimism\u2011based methods (e.g., Daskalakis et al.) showed last\u2011iterate stability in special cases; this paper advances that thread by achieving single\u2011call, interpolation\u2011driven last\u2011iterate guarantees under broader operator regularity, thereby unifying proximal, fixed\u2011point, and deep\u2011learning optimizer perspectives.",
