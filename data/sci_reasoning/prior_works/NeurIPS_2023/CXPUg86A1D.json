  "synthesis_narrative": "SPAE fuses two previously separate lines of work: discrete visual autoencoding for generation and frozen large language models for multimodal reasoning. From VQ-VAE and VQ-VAE-2, it inherits the core mechanism of compressing images into discrete codes and decoding them back with high fidelity, extending the hierarchical idea into a semantic pyramid so coarse tokens convey global meaning while finer levels capture details. DALL\u00b7E established that images can be treated as sequences of discrete tokens that a language model can autoregressively generate; SPAE adopts this perspective but crucially replaces arbitrary code indices with interpretable lexical tokens drawn from the LLM\u2019s own vocabulary, creating a native, text-like interface.\n\nOn the language side, Frozen, Flamingo, and BLIP-2 showed that frozen LLMs can be powerful multimodal reasoners when fed suitable visual adapters, enabling strong in-context learning without updating LLM weights. SPAE\u2019s key step is to swap continuous adapters for a discrete, lexical interface: images are encoded as words the LLM already \u201cknows,\u201d so the same frozen LLM can both understand and generate non-linguistic content by reading and emitting these tokens. Finally, CLIP\u2019s success in aligning text and image semantics motivates SPAE\u2019s emphasis on semantic interpretability of tokens, ensuring they are meaningful to the LLM. Together, these works directly enable SPAE\u2019s contribution: a semantic, pyramid-structured, vocabulary-aligned tokenizer that lets a frozen LLM perform both image understanding and image generation in an in-context learning regime.",
