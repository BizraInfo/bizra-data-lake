  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014bounded-size agnostic sample compression for regression\u2014sits squarely in the long-standing sample compression program initiated by Floyd and Warmuth, who formalized compression schemes and posed the central conjecture. The decisive modern breakthrough for classification by Moran and Yehudayoff demonstrated that bounded-size compression exists for all VC classes; this existence paradigm directly inspires the present paper\u2019s transition to real-valued prediction, where fat-shattering plays the role of VC dimension. The foundational works of Alon, Ben-David, Cesa-Bianchi, and Haussler, and of Bartlett, Long, and Williamson established fat-shattering as the right capacity measure for real-valued agnostic learning and provided the uniform convergence toolkit needed to relate function class complexity to approximation guarantees\u2014precisely the linkage exploited to derive compression sizes exponential in fat-shattering yet independent of sample size. On the negative side, David, Moran, and Yehudayoff\u2019s impossibility for exact agnostic compression under \u21132 loss crystallized a key barrier; the current paper directly targets this gap, both broadening the impossibility to all p in (1,\u221e) and separating the \u21131/\u2113\u221e regimes with efficient exact schemes of size linear in the dimension. Finally, the agnostic PAC framework of Kearns and Schapire provides the overarching problem formulation, situating the results within distribution-free learning under arbitrary noise. Together, these works form the immediate intellectual lineage enabling the paper\u2019s positive approximate schemes and refined impossibility/possibility landscape across \u2113p losses.",
