  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution is a structured agenda that pinpoints six fusion challenges where machine learning can deliver outsized impact, and it is directly scaffolded by several landmark works. For disruption prediction, Kates-Harbeck et al. (2019) established the viability of deep learning on multi-diagnostic streams to forecast disruptions, while JET\u2019s APODIS demonstrated real-time operational deployment\u2014together motivating the paper\u2019s recommendation to transition from proof-of-concept predictors to robust, interpretable, and device-generalizable systems. For simulation and dynamics modeling, Citrin et al. (2017) showed that neural surrogates of turbulent transport (e.g., QuaLiKiz) can bring orders-of-magnitude speedups, supporting the paper\u2019s call for ML-accelerated multiphysics workflows and uncertainty-aware surrogates. In control, Degrave et al. (2022) proved deep RL can control plasma shape on a real device, and Felici & Sauter\u2019s RAPTOR provided a control-oriented modeling paradigm; these anchor the paper\u2019s vision for hybrid ML\u2013physics controllers, state estimators, and MPC. The agenda\u2019s materials discovery thrust draws on the Materials Project\u2019s demonstration that curated data infrastructures and ML pipelines can systematically accelerate materials innovation\u2014an approach readily adapted to fusion-relevant, radiation-tolerant materials. Finally, OMFIT exemplifies the data and workflow integration the paper argues is essential: standardized schemas, accessible archives, and tooling to make fusion data ML-ready. Collectively, these works justify the paper\u2019s claim that fusion is primed for impactful ML across prediction, modeling, inference, control, experimental design, and materials.",
