  "synthesis_narrative": "Christiano et al. introduced the now-standard practice of eliciting pairwise preferences over trajectory segments and modeling them with a Bradley\u2013Terry likelihood, establishing a concrete statistical interface between human feedback and policy optimization. Sadigh et al. sharpened this interface by positing linear reward parameterizations learned from comparisons, giving a tractable modeling assumption and identifiability conditions for reward recovery from preference data. In parallel, Jin et al. formalized reward-free exploration as a two-phase paradigm in which an agent first collects exploratory trajectories agnostic to any specific reward and later plans once a task is specified, crystallizing the coverage requirements needed for universal downstream tasks. Jin, Yang, and Wang further provided the linear MDP framework and coverage notions (via features and optimism) ensuring that exploration data supports accurate value estimation for any linear reward. Jiang et al. contributed a low-rank/witness-rank structural lens, showing how exploration can be targeted under low-rank dynamics to obtain PAC guarantees in rich observations. Yue and Joachims framed learning from pairwise comparisons as dueling bandits, but with a regret focus and no MDP structure, spotlighting gaps in sample complexity and dynamics handling.\nTaken together, these works reveal a clear opportunity: fuse preference-based reward modeling (Bradley\u2013Terry with linear rewards) with reward-free exploration guarantees (linear and low-rank structures) to minimize costly human feedback. By generalizing reward-free exploration to the preference setting and invoking linear/low-rank coverage conditions, the present paper shows that pre-collecting exploratory trajectories enables accurate reward inference and optimal policy learning with fewer comparisons, closing the theory\u2013practice gap in preference-based RL.",

    "abstract": "Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) is a paradigm in which an RL agent learns to optimize a task using pair-wise preference-based feedback over trajectories, rather than explicit reward signals. While PbRL has demonstrated practical success in fine-tuning language models, existing theoretical work focuses on regret minimization and fails to capture most of the practical frameworks. In this study, we fill in such a gap between theoretical PbRL and practical algorithms by proposing a theoretical reward-agnostic PbRL framework where exploratory trajectories that enable accurate learning of hidden reward functions are acquired before collecting any human feedback. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that our algorithm requires less human feedback for learning the optimal policy under preference-based models with linear parameterization and unknown transitions, compared to the existing theoretical literature. Specifically, our framework can incorporate linear and low-rank MDPs with",
