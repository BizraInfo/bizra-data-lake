  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014explicit constructions of data re-uploading PQCs with the first non-asymptotic approximation error bounds for multivariate polynomials and smooth functions\u2014emerges from combining three threads of prior work. First, foundational results on data re-uploading universality (P\u00e9rez-Salinas et al.) established that repeated data encodings can render PQCs universal, while early demonstrations that PQCs generate polynomial/trigonometric features (Mitarai et al.) suggested a natural pathway to approximating classical functions. Second, harmonic analyses of data encoding (Schuld et al.; Abbas et al.) rigorously characterized the output of such circuits as finite Fourier series with frequency content governed by the number and structure of re-uploadings. These results provide the precise mechanism by which circuit depth and repetitions control the representable polynomial degree, which is essential for moving from existential universality to quantitative approximation guarantees. Third, constructive tools for realizing polynomials in quantum circuits (Gily\u00e9n et al., via quantum signal processing/singular value transformation) supply degree\u2013depth relations that align with the Fourier-based picture, while classical constructive approximation theory (DeVore & Lorentz) delivers non-asymptotic degree\u2013error rates for multivariate polynomials and smooth function classes. By fusing these ingredients, the paper translates desired approximation accuracy into explicit bounds on qubits, depth, and trainable parameters for data re-uploading PQCs, resolving the gap between nonconstructive universality claims and practical, resource-aware expressivity guarantees.",
