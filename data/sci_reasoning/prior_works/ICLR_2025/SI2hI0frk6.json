  "synthesis_narrative": "Transfusion\u2019s core innovation\u2014training one transformer over mixed-modality sequences by unifying next-token prediction for text with diffusion for images\u2014stands on two pillars: unified sequence modeling and transformer-native diffusion. On the unified modeling side, Gato established that a single transformer can operate over interleaved multimodal tokens with an NTP objective, providing the problem formulation Transfusion adopts for mixed data streams. Flamingo further showed that attaching modality-specific interface layers around a shared language backbone is a powerful design pattern, which Transfusion adapts as modality-specific encoders/decoders to improve multimodal performance without fragmenting the core model.\nOn the generative side, DDPM supplies the denoising objective that powers Transfusion\u2019s image generation. Latent Diffusion makes diffusion practical by operating in a learned latent space, a key enabler for Transfusion\u2019s aggressive image compression (down to roughly 16 patches) while keeping quality. DiT proves that diffusion can be implemented with a pure transformer backbone, which Transfusion leverages to share one transformer across text (NTP) and images (diffusion) rather than relying on separate U-Nets.\nFinally, the VQGAN+Transformer paradigm and DALL\u00b7E represent the discrete-image-token autoregressive baseline that Transfusion explicitly challenges. Their scaling and fidelity limitations with quantized image tokens motivate Transfusion\u2019s shift to diffusion for images within the same model, leading to better scaling across uni- and cross-modal tasks.",
