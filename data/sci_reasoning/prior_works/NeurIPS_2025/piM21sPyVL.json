  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution is a black-box reduction that transforms high-accuracy static mechanisms for answering linear queries into mechanisms that support fully dynamic (turnstile) streams under continual observation, incurring only polylogarithmic utility loss. Two seminal strands of prior work directly converge here. First, continual-observation mechanisms\u2014especially the binary-tree/hierarchical methods of Chan\u2013Shi\u2013Song and Dwork\u2013Naor\u2013Pitassi\u2013Rothblum\u2014established how to schedule noisy releases over time so that privacy composes gracefully while accuracy degrades only logarithmically in the horizon. These techniques provide the temporal aggregation scaffold that the present work extends from insertion-only counters to general linear queries with insertions and deletions.\n\nSecond, advances in static mechanisms for linear workloads\u2014exemplified by the Matrix Mechanism, the multiplicative-weights mechanism (MWEM), and geometric/K-norm methods\u2014yield near-optimal accuracy for static datasets. The new paper treats such mechanisms as black-box oracles, showing how to invoke them over carefully structured, disjoint summaries so that their static accuracy is preserved up to polylogarithmic factors in the dynamic setting.\n\nFinally, streaming-friendly DP via linear sketches, as illustrated by the JL-based approach of Blocki\u2013Blum\u2013Datta\u2013Sheffet, informs how to maintain compact, efficiently updatable representations under turnstile updates. Combining hierarchical time-partitioning with sketch-maintainable state enables efficient updates and continual releases. Together, these works directly enable the paper\u2019s general transformation from static DP for linear queries to fully dynamic, continually released answers with provably small utility degradation.",
