  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014a lightweight, head-specific sigmoid gate applied after scaled dot-product attention\u2014sits squarely in the lineage of gating as a means to regulate information flow. LSTM introduced the core idea of learnable gates to control what to pass or suppress, later refined in Transformers by Shazeer\u2019s GLU variants, which showed that small, multiplicative sigmoid-style gates can substantially improve performance and scaling. GTrXL further demonstrated that gating around attention pathways stabilizes optimization, anticipating the present work\u2019s findings of improved training stability and tolerance to larger learning rates.\n\nBeyond architectural precedent, Linformer provided a crucial theoretical backdrop by framing self-attention as effectively low-rank. The present paper\u2019s analysis\u2014that adding a nonlinearity after SDPA enriches this low-rank mapping\u2014aligns with that perspective, explaining consistent gains from a simple post-attention gate. On the distributional side, entmax showed that altering attention nonlinearities to encourage sparsity can yield better inductive biases. Rather than modifying normalization, the new method induces sparsity at the output of attention via a gate, simplifying implementation while capturing similar benefits.\n\nFinally, works on head redundancy (Michel et al.) and sparsely-gated MoE (Shazeer et al. 2017) connect the head-specific gate to practical sparsification and scaling: the gate can suppress unhelpful heads, reduce pathological focus, and integrate cleanly with MoE training. Together, these threads directly underpin the paper\u2019s core insight: a minimal, per-head sigmoid gate after SDPA reliably improves quality, stability, and scaling by injecting targeted nonlinearity and controllable sparsity into the attention pathway.",
