  "synthesis_narrative": "The core contribution of eSEN is to bridge the gap between low test-set errors and reliable physical property prediction by ensuring smooth, energy-conserving dynamics in molecular simulations. This line begins with Behler\u2013Parrinello, which established the atomic-energy decomposition and smooth cutoff strategy that makes forces conservative by construction\u2014an indispensable foundation for any ML interatomic potential used in MD. Chmiela et al. (sGDML) crystallized the insight that enforcing conservativity is not optional: energy-conserving force fields yield stable trajectories and physically consistent statistics. DeePMD operationalized these principles at scale, showing that careful smoothing of descriptors and cutoffs directly improves MD reliability for materials properties, a principle eSEN imports into the latest equivariant architectures.\n\nModern expressive equivariant MLIPs\u2014NequIP, MACE, and Allegro\u2014delivered state-of-the-art accuracy, but their modeling choices can introduce subtle non-smoothness or conservative-force violations that manifest as energy drift in MD. eSEN explicitly targets these failure modes: it adopts the expressivity of NequIP/MACE/Allegro while modifying radial/basis design and neighbor handling to enforce smoothness and conserve energy. GemNet-OC\u2019s directional message passing and smooth geometric envelopes further informed how to structure features without sacrificing differentiability at cutoffs. By integrating these threads, eSEN proposes a practical energy-conservation test that aligns test errors with downstream performance and introduces architectural refinements that make highly expressive equivariant potentials dependable for stability, thermal conductivity, and phonon predictions.",
