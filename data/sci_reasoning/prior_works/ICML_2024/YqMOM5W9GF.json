  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of Principled Preferential Bayesian Optimization is to endow preferential BO with rigorous uncertainty quantification and information-theoretic regret guarantees by constructing confidence sets from pairwise preferences via a likelihood-ratio view and then acting optimistically. This builds on two foundational pillars. First, Chu and Ghahramani\u2019s GP preference-learning model established the probabilistic link from comparisons to a latent utility function, providing the exact likelihood the new work exploits to form confidence sets. Second, Srinivas et al.\u2019s GP-UCB provided the optimism paradigm and information-theoretic regret tools for GP-driven BO; the present paper transports these ideas to the strictly weaker, comparison-only feedback regime.\nWithin preference-driven decision making, Yue and Joachims formalized the dueling bandits framework and regret notions for pairwise feedback, while Zoghi et al. showed that optimism (UCB) can be adapted to preference observations in discrete-armed settings. These works motivate adopting an optimistic strategy under pairwise feedback, but prior PBO methods\u2014epitomized by Gonz\u00e1lez et al.\u2014were largely heuristic and lacked regret guarantees. Finally, likelihood-based confidence construction from Filippi et al. (GLM bandits) directly inspires the paper\u2019s likelihood-ratio confidence sets in a nonparametric GP context. By synthesizing GP preference modeling, optimism with information-theoretic analysis, and likelihood-based confidence construction, the paper delivers the first principled, regret-analyzed algorithm for preferential BO and a provably convergent best-solution reporting scheme.",
