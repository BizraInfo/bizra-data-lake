  "synthesis_narrative": "ORCA\u2019s align-then-refine framework stems from two converging lines of work: cross-modal connectors to large pretrained models and distribution alignment from domain adaptation. The connector paradigm was crystallized by Frozen and Flamingo, which showed that a small learnable adapter can map non-text (e.g., images) into a frozen language model. ORCA directly adopts and generalizes this idea beyond vision by learning a modality-specific embedding network that produces LM-like (or more generally, pretraining-modality-like) representations. However, rather than relying on paired multimodal data or keeping the backbone frozen, ORCA addresses two key limitations: it explicitly aligns distributions and then fine-tunes the backbone. The alignment stage is grounded in classic domain adaptation: adversarial alignment (DANN) and MMD-based alignment (Deep Adaptation Networks) are used to match the target embedding distribution to the pretrained modality\u2019s hidden-state distribution. Building on LiT\u2019s lock-then-align insight, ORCA freezes the large model during alignment and then refines by unfreezing and fine-tuning to exploit cross-modal knowledge. Against general-purpose architectures like Perceiver IO, which require training a new modality-agnostic backbone, ORCA achieves broad applicability by reusing a single powerful pretrained model. Finally, relative to unifying-pretraining approaches such as data2vec that still need large encoders per modality, ORCA provides a lightweight path: learn an aligner, then refine the existing model, enabling strong transfer to many modalities that lack their own large-scale pretraining.",
