  "synthesis_narrative": "Temporal modeling has advanced along two converging lines: 2D re-parameterizations of time series and multi-scale/frequency-aware architectures. TimesNet showed that converting sequences into 2D temporal variation images enables a single backbone to support diverse tasks, though its 2D construction relies on fixed periodic priors and limited cross-resolution interaction. Autoformer demonstrated that explicitly decomposing signals into components (e.g., seasonal and trend) stabilizes long-horizon learning through auto-correlation, pointing to the value of structured separation before mixing. FEDformer established that focusing computation in the frequency domain and selecting informative bands substantially improves long-term modeling, suggesting frequency-aware fusion is crucial. N-HiTS introduced hierarchical multi-resolution interpolation to reconstruct signals across scales, highlighting the benefits of coarse-to-fine fusion. PatchTST operationalized patch-wise tokenization to strengthen local pattern capture while maintaining global context. Complementing these, the original TimeMixer provided a simple yet effective multi-scale mixer for forecasting, emphasizing decomposable cross-time/channel mixing without expensive attention. Together, these works expose a gap: a universal pattern machine that unifies multi-resolution time\u2013frequency representations, explicit decomposition, and learnable cross-scale/resolution fusion for broad predictive analysis. TimeMixer++ synthesizes these insights by turning sequences into multi-resolution time images (generalizing TimesNet), decomposing them in-image (echoing Autoformer/N-HiTS), and introducing multi-scale and multi-resolution mixers (building on TimeMixer and FEDformer while leveraging patch-wise structuring from PatchTST), yielding a task-agnostic extractor of temporal patterns.",

    "abstract": "Time series analysis plays a critical role in numerous applications, supporting tasks such as forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation. In this work, we present the time series pattern machine (TSPM), a model designed to excel in a broad range of time series tasks through powerful representation and pattern extraction capabilities. Traditional time series models often struggle to capture universal patterns, limiting their effectiveness across diverse tasks. To address this, we define multiple scales in the time domain and various resolutions in the frequency domain, employing various mixing strategies to extract intricate, task-adaptive time series patterns. Specifically, we introduce TimeMixer++, a general-purpose TSPM that processes multi-scale time series using (1) multi-resolution time imaging (MRTI), (2) time image decomposition (TID), (3) multi-scale mixing (MCM), and (4) multi-resolution mixing (MRM) to extract comprehensive temporal patterns.
