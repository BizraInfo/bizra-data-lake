  "synthesis_narrative": "FlowDrag\u2019s core innovation\u2014turning user drags into globally consistent image edits by lifting them into a 3D mesh deformation and then guiding diffusion with a projected flow\u2014sits at the intersection of interactive dragging, classical mesh editing, and spatially conditioned diffusion. Drag Your GAN established the handle-to-target formulation and interactive point-tracking loss that defined the drag-editing problem, but its 2D/manifold optimization often breaks object geometry. Diffusion-based successors (e.g., Drag Anything) inherit the same limitation by focusing narrowly on point correspondence. FlowDrag identifies this gap and brings in the well-established machinery of handle-driven mesh deformation: Laplacian surface editing provides the constraint-based energy formulation; ARAP regularization preserves local rigidity to avoid shearing and folding; and MLS informs how sparse handles propagate to smooth, dense displacement fields. To instantiate 3D awareness from a single image, FlowDrag leverages modern monocular depth (e.g., DPT) to construct a proxy mesh, enabling physically plausible deformations tied to scene structure. Finally, to make these deformations operative inside a diffusion model, FlowDrag adapts the ControlNet philosophy of spatial conditioning, injecting the mesh-projected 2D displacement (a vector flow field) directly into the U-Net denoiser. This lineage\u2014from DragGAN\u2019s interaction model, through classical mesh energies, to ControlNet-style conditioning\u2014directly enables FlowDrag\u2019s precise point alignment while preserving global geometry, and motivates its new benchmark to measure target-matching fidelity objectively.",
