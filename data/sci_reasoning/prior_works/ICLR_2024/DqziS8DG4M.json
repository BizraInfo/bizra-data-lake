  "synthesis_narrative": "The Minimum Description Length (MDL) formulation of Davies et al. established that high-quality shape correspondences should minimize model complexity (i.e., produce compact, low-variance population models), thereby defining a principled, cohort-level objective for statistical shape modeling. Particle-based ShapeWorks operationalized this by optimizing an entropy/compactness\u2013driven energy to place correspondences across a cohort, showing that uniform coverage and global compactness can yield reliable SSMs without template parameterization. In contrast, SPHARM-PDM enforced correspondences through spherical harmonic parameterization of clean, genus-0 meshes, revealing both the utility of global correspondences and the fragility of template/assumption-heavy pipelines. Learning-based correspondence methods such as 3D-CODED demonstrated that dense correspondences can be predicted directly from point sets by deforming a template, while functional-map methods (e.g., Deep Functional Maps) showed how global consistency can be learned but typically require meshes and spectral bases. DeepSSM then brought deep learning to anatomical SSMs, but depended on precomputed correspondences and curated inputs, highlighting the need for end-to-end correspondence learning from raw data. Together, these works exposed a gap: classical SSM objectives efficiently define global correspondence quality, and deep methods can predict correspondences from point sets, yet no approach fused them to yield template-free, fast SSM inference from raw point clouds. Point2SSM takes the natural next step by embedding the MDL/particle compactness principle as a differentiable, cohort-level loss into a point-cloud predictor, producing globally consistent correspondence landmarks per shape without cohort optimization, templates, or mesh prerequisites.",

    "abstract": "We present Point2SSM, a novel unsupervised learning approach for constructing correspondence-based statistical shape models (SSMs) directly from raw point clouds. SSM is crucial in clinical research, enabling population-level analysis of morphological variation in bones and organs. Traditional methods of SSM construction have limitations, including the requirement of noise-free surface meshes or binary volumes, reliance on assumptions or templates, and prolonged inference times due to simultaneous optimization of the entire cohort. Point2SSM overcomes these barriers by providing a data-driven solution that infers SSMs directly from raw point clouds, reducing inference burdens and increasing applicability as point clouds are more easily acquired. While deep learning on 3D point clouds has seen success in unsupervised representation learning and shape correspondence, its application to anatomical SSM construction is largely unexplored. We conduct a benchmark of state-of-the-art point clo",
