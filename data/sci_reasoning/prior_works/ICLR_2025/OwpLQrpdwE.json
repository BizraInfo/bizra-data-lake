  "synthesis_narrative": "Vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces established by Micchelli and Pontil provide the mathematical framework for learning multi-output functions with operator-valued kernels, enabling kernel ridge regression for vector fields. Building on this, \u00c1lvarez, Rosasco, and Lawrence surveyed structured operator-valued kernels, including constructions tied to linear operators, clarifying how prior knowledge can be embedded into the kernel to constrain outputs. Singer and Wu\u2019s vector diffusion maps introduced a data-driven way to estimate tangent spaces and parallel transport via the connection Laplacian from point clouds, giving practical access to manifold geometry needed to restrict vector fields to tangent bundles. On the numerical side, Munthe-Kaas introduced Lie-group Runge\u2013Kutta methods that approximate exponential flows so trajectories remain on manifolds, while Hairer, Lubich, and Wanner\u2019s geometric numerical integration theory supplied structure-preserving schemes and rigorous error analyses for invariants and manifolds. Absil, Mahony, and Sepulchre formalized retractions as computationally efficient approximations to exponential maps with convergence guarantees in manifold optimization. Finally, Manifold Neural ODEs demonstrated learning and integrating manifold-constrained dynamics using retractions, highlighting feasibility but also the computational burden of neural parameterizations.\nSynthesizing these strands reveals a gap: although operator-valued kernels can encode constraints and manifold geometry can be estimated from data, there was no kernel construction that enforces tangency using data-driven geometry, nor a paired, provably geometry-preserving solver outside heavy neural ODE frameworks. The present work naturally unifies these insights by designing an operator-valued kernel that projects onto data-estimated tangent spaces and by adopting an exponential-map\u2013approximating integrator with geometric error bounds, achieving efficient, structure-respecting learning and time integration of ODEs on manifolds.",

    "abstract": "We address the problem of learning ordinary differential equations (ODEs) on manifolds. Existing machine learning methods, particularly those using neural networks, often struggle with high computational demands. To overcome this issue, we introduce a geometrically constrained operator-valued kernel that allows us to represent vector fields on tangent bundles of smooth manifolds. The construction of the kernel imposes the geometric constraints that are estimated from the data and ensures the computational feasibility for learning high dimensional systems of ODEs. Once the vector fields are estimated, e.g., by the kernel ridge regression, we need an ODE solver that guarantees the solution to stay on (or close to) the manifold. To overcome this issue, we propose a geometry-preserving ODE solver that approximates the exponential maps corresponding to the ODE solutions.  We deduce a theoretical error bound for the proposed solver that guarantees the approximate solutions to lie on the mani",
