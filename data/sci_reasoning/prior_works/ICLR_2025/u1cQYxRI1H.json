  "synthesis_narrative": "IC-Light\u2019s central idea is to stabilize and scale diffusion-based illumination harmonization by imposing a physically grounded light-transport consistency during training: the appearance under mixed illumination should equal a linear blend of appearances under the component illuminations. This principle traces directly to classic reflectance and relighting research. Debevec et al. demonstrated that reflectance fields enable relighting by linear recombination of images captured under basis lights, while Ramamoorthi and Hanrahan formalized the linear mapping from spherical-harmonic lighting to image irradiance for Lambertian materials. Basri and Jacobs proved that images under varying distant illumination occupy a low-dimensional linear subspace, further cementing linearity as a core property of image formation with fixed intrinsic attributes. Sen et al. made the superposition explicit through the light-transport matrix, reinforcing that mixing illumination should produce linearly consistent results.\n\nOn the learning side, Bell et al. (Intrinsic Images in the Wild) and Barron and Malik (SIRFS) documented how difficult and ambiguous it is to disentangle albedo and shading at scale, especially in in-the-wild data. IC-Light sidesteps explicit intrinsic inversion yet achieves intrinsic preservation by enforcing the linearity constraint during training, preventing albedo drift. Finally, the method situates within structure-guided diffusion (ControlNet): whereas naive conditional training over diverse data can degrade into a structure-guided random generator, IC-Light injects a physics-based consistency loss that turns the conditioning into precise, scalable illumination control across heterogeneous sources.",
