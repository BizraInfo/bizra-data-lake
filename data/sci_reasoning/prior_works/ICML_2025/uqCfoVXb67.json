  "synthesis_narrative": "UniDB\u2019s core insight emerges at the intersection of diffusion generative modeling, diffusion bridges, and linearly solvable stochastic optimal control. Doob\u2019s classical h-transform (Doob, 1957) and Jamison\u2019s treatment of Schr\u00f6dinger bridges (1975) establish the mathematical backbone for endpoint-conditioned diffusion paths\u2014precisely the objects modern diffusion bridge methods deploy. On the generative side, the SDE-based score framework of Song et al. (2021) provides the continuous-time formulation and score parameterization that UniDB leverages to express controllers in terms of learned scores.\n\nMethodologically, De Bortoli et al. (2021) operationalized Schr\u00f6dinger bridges for generative modeling, becoming a primary practical baseline. However, its strict endpoint enforcement can lead to over-smoothed outputs. UniDB diagnoses this rigorously by embedding bridges into an SOC objective and showing that Doob-based/strict-bridge methods arise when the terminal penalty tends to infinity. This perspective is directly inspired by linearly solvable control (Todorov, 2007), where the optimal control is expressed via a desirability function\u2014mathematically a Doob h-transform\u2014revealing the structural equivalence. Finally, results on optimal stochastic steering with terminal distributions (Chen, Georgiou, Pavon, 2016) clarify the hard-constraint regime that UniDB relaxes: by introducing a tunable terminal penalty, UniDB attains a closed-form optimal controller that interpolates between unconstrained diffusion generation and rigid bridges, thereby mitigating the characteristic blurring observed in prior bridge-based methods while unifying them under one SOC framework.",
