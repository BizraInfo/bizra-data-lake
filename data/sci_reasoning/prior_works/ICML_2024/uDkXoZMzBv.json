  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014showing that the learning dynamics of deep overparameterized low-rank models are confined to invariant low-dimensional subspaces and can thus be trained as compact factorizations\u2014draws from two converging lines of prior work. First, Saxe et al.\u2019s exact analysis of deep linear networks established that gradient dynamics evolve along singular modes, foreshadowing the invariant subspace phenomenon the authors formalize for deep low-rank recovery. Complementary optimization landscape results in deep linear and low-rank nonconvex problems (Kawaguchi; Ge\u2013Lee\u2013Ma) and gradient-based recovery algorithms for factorized low-rank sensing (Tu et al.) provide the guarantees that training compact factorizations can recover globally optimal solutions comparable to overparameterized training. Foundational matrix completion theory (Cand\u00e8s\u2013Recht) anchors the problem setting and desired recovery behavior.\n\nSecond, recent evidence that practical adaptation is intrinsically low-dimensional (Aghajanyan et al.) and the success of low-rank adapters (LoRA) motivate the paper\u2019s application side. The authors\u2019 subspace-invariance theory offers a principled mechanism explaining why low-rank fine-tuning can match full-model updates: the parameter trajectory is compressible and remains within a small invariant subspace. By unifying deep-linear dynamics, benign low-rank landscapes, and subspace-efficient adaptation, the paper advances a theoretically grounded recipe: train in a compact factorized parameterization aligned with the invariant subspace, retaining the optimization and generalization benefits of overparameterization while reducing computation, and validate this in deep matrix completion and LLM fine-tuning.",
