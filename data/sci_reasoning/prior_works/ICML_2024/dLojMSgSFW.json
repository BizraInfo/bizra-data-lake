  "synthesis_narrative": "The position paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014a proposal for legal and technical safe harbor to protect independent AI evaluation and red teaming\u2014builds on three converging streams of prior work. First, methodological advances in adversarial testing demonstrate why independent evaluation is indispensable. Dynabench showed that dynamic, human-driven adversarial evaluation exposes failures static benchmarks miss, while Anthropic\u2019s red-teaming methodology operationalized structured adversarial probing for LLM harms. HELM extended this by arguing for comprehensive, transparent, and public-interest model evaluations. Together, these works establish the technical necessity of external, adversarial scrutiny.\nSecond, governance scholarship emphasizes that credible accountability requires outsider access. Raji et al. articulate why third\u2011party audits cannot be fully effective under developer-controlled programs, directly motivating a protected channel for independent evaluators. Shevlane et al. sharpen this for high-stakes risks, recommending adversarial and third\u2011party testing for dangerous capabilities\u2014precisely the kind of work that can be chilled by restrictive ToS.\nThird, the algorithmic auditing literature and legal precedents illuminate the barrier: platform terms and computer misuse statutes have historically deterred socially valuable audits. Sandvig et al. chronicled both the importance of audits and the chilling effect of ToS/CFAA, while Van Buren narrowed CFAA liability, illustrating how legal clarity can enable good\u2011faith research. Synthesizing these threads, the ICML position argues that formal safe harbor commitments are the missing institutional mechanism to align incentives and remove credible threats of account suspension or legal reprisal, thereby enabling robust, independent AI safety evaluation.",
