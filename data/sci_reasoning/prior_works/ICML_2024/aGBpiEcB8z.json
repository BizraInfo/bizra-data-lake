  "synthesis_narrative": "BayOTIDE\u2019s core idea\u2014online, probabilistic imputation of multivariate time series via interpretable functional decomposition\u2014emerges by fusing classical decomposition modeling with modern probabilistic and streaming needs. Prophet (Taylor et al., 2017) and TBATS (De Livera et al., 2011) established decomposable trend\u2013seasonality formulations using harmonic (Fourier) bases to capture global periodic structure, providing the functional blueprint BayOTIDE adopts. OTiDE (Fang et al., 2023) then operationalized this idea in an online framework for imputation/forecasting, but lacked a fully Bayesian treatment and comprehensive support for irregular sampling; BayOTIDE directly extends this baseline with Bayesian inference for uncertainty quantification and principled handling of irregularly sampled streams. In contrast, dominant learning-based imputers like BRITS (Cao et al., 2018) and CSDI (Tashiro et al., 2021) train on fixed local windows and typically presume regular timestamps, motivating BayOTIDE\u2019s emphasis on capturing global trends/periodicity and online updates for streaming data. Works tackling irregular sampling with deep generative models, such as GP-VAE (Fortuin et al., 2020) and Latent ODEs (Rubanova et al., 2019), highlight the need for continuous-time reasoning but remain offline and do not explicitly encode interpretable global structure. BayOTIDE synthesizes these threads: it preserves the interpretability and global coverage of classical functional decomposition while delivering online Bayesian inference and robust irregular-sampling imputation for multivariate streams.",
