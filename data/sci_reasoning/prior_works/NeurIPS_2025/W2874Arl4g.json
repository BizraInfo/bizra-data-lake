  "synthesis_narrative": "Self-Taught Lookahead (STL) fuses classical value-based planning with language-native reasoning and modern self-training. Bellman\u2019s formulation of dynamic programming and value iteration provides the conceptual backbone: improving a value function by backing up through predicted next states. Value Iteration Networks operationalized this idea in neural architectures, inspiring STL\u2019s move to make the backup itself a learned computation\u2014but carried out in natural language. Chain-of-Thought prompting supplies the methodological substrate, demonstrating that LMs can articulate intermediate computations; STL recasts a Bellman update as a CoT step that forecasts an action, the resulting state, and a rationale linking the transition to value. STaR contributes the blueprint for reward-free self-improvement: use the model\u2019s own generated reasoning as supervision. ReAct grounds this in interactive domains by interleaving thought and action, giving STL the format to model state transitions explicitly for web tasks. Tree of Thoughts shows that search efficiency hinges on good value heuristics; STL targets precisely this component, self-improving a value LLM so search expands fewer nodes without sacrificing quality. Finally, Constitutional AI exemplifies replacing human feedback with AI feedback; STL advances this trajectory by replacing scalar judgments with structured, language-based lookahead traces that train value estimates without any labeled rewards or demonstrations.",
