  "synthesis_narrative": "Separable PINN (SPINN) sits at the intersection of physics-informed training, separable representations, and practical automatic differentiation strategies. The original PINN formulation by Raissi et al. provided the residual-based objective and demonstrated the feasibility of training neural solvers directly on collocation points, but incurred heavy reverse-mode AD and memory costs as dimensionality and point counts grew. DGM similarly emphasized point-wise processing, reinforcing the fundamental cost structure that SPINN targets. To scale PINNs, domain-decomposition methods like XPINNs partition space-time, but they introduce interface conditions and communication overhead; SPINN instead attacks the per-iteration complexity with an architectural change.\n\nFrom numerical methods, PGD and low-rank tensor formats (e.g., the Tensor-Train decomposition) established that many high-dimensional PDE solutions admit separated, low-rank structure. SPINN adapts this insight to neural representations, constructing the solution via per-axis subnetworks whose compositions act like tensor factors, drastically reducing the number of full network propagations relative to point-wise schemes. Complementing this, insights from tensorized neural networks showed how factorization of neural computations yields sizable efficiency gains\u2014principles that SPINN applies to coordinate MLPs for PDEs.\n\nFinally, SPINN\u2019s use of forward-mode automatic differentiation draws on established AD theory clarifying when forward-mode is preferable for input-derivative computations. By leveraging forward-mode for PDE residuals, SPINN reduces memory footprints and unlocks training with over ten million collocation points on a single GPU, operationalizing separability with a scalable differentiation pipeline.",
