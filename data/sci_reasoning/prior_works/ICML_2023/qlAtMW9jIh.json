  "synthesis_narrative": "This paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014clarifying how to interpret uncertain evidence and providing consistency guidelines for Bayesian inference in probabilistic models and simulators\u2014rests directly on three historical pillars and two modern theoretical advances. Jeffrey (1983) provides the foundational probability-kinematics formalism (Jeffrey conditioning) for updating with soft evidence. Pearl (1988) introduces virtual (likelihood) evidence within Bayesian networks, yielding a competing semantics for uncertain observations. Chan and Darwiche (2005) sharpen the distinction between these updates, detailing when they agree or diverge and exposing semantic pitfalls, which the present work extends into concrete consistency criteria and practical guidance. Koller and Friedman (2009) codify virtual/soft evidence for graphical models, furnishing the operative baseline mechanism that practitioners employ and that this paper reevaluates. In the simulator setting, Wilkinson (2013) shows that ABC becomes exact under an explicit error model\u2014an insight that directly motivates the paper\u2019s thesis: correct interpretation of uncertainty is crucial for valid inference. Complementing these are generalized Bayes principles (Bissiri et al., 2016), which legitimize nonstandard updates via scoring rules and conceptually encompass \u2018distributional evidence.\u2019 Finally, Heitjan and Rubin\u2019s (1991) coarsening framework identifies when partial or noisy observations are ignorable versus when explicit modeling is required, aligning with the paper\u2019s guidelines for when each uncertain-evidence interpretation is consistent. Together, these works form the immediate intellectual lineage enabling the paper\u2019s analysis and prescriptions.",
