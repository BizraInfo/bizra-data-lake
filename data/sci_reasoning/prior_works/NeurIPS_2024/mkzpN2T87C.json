  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014first explicit, non-asymptotic global convergence rates for classical BFGS under Armijo\u2013Wolfe line search\u2014rests on three intertwined lines of prior work. First are the algorithmic foundations of BFGS itself (Goldfarb 1970), which define the secant structure and positive definiteness preserved by line-search implementations. Second are the line-search principles inaugurated by Armijo (1966) and Wolfe (1969), whose sufficient decrease and curvature conditions control step sizes and enforce meaningful progress; these conditions anchor most global analyses of line-search methods. Built on them is the Zoutendijk framework (1970), which connects Armijo\u2013Wolfe steps to summability inequalities enabling global convergence arguments; the present work tightens this pathway to extract explicit per-iteration decrease and rates. The local behavior of BFGS is classically characterized by Dennis and Mor\u00e9 (1974), who proved superlinear convergence under a Lipschitz Hessian; this paper globalizes that local picture, deriving an explicit superlinear bound O((1/t)^t) and, when the Hessian is Lipschitz, a linear rate independent of the condition number, driven solely by line-search parameters. Powell\u2019s early global results (1976) for variable-metric methods with inexact line searches provide the historical backdrop for global guarantees, which here are made quantitative and explicit. Finally, modern quasi-Newton analyses (Rodomanov and Nesterov, 2021) offered rates for modified updates, underscoring the open challenge for classical BFGS that this paper resolves by establishing global linear and superlinear non-asymptotic rates from arbitrary initialization.",
