  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core idea\u2014augmenting online finetuning of Decision Transformers with RL gradients\u2014sits at the intersection of return-conditioned sequence modeling and advantage/value-driven policy improvement. Decision Transformer established the return-to-go (RTG) conditioning paradigm, but this supervisory target can drift from the true expected return during online finetuning, especially with low-reward pretraining data. Deterministic Policy Gradient theory formalized how actor updates can directly follow the gradient of a learned Q-function, and TD3 translated this into a stable, practical algorithm with twin critics and delayed updates. Together, they provide the exact gradient signal the paper leverages as a \"vitamin\" to correct RTG mis-specification.\nConcurrently, offline-to-online methods like AWAC, CQL, and IQL showed that value and advantage estimates are robust anchors when data are suboptimal or distribution-shifted, outperforming pure behavior cloning on raw returns. AWAC\u2019s advantage-weighted updates exemplify how learned value baselines rectify biases from na\u00efve supervision, while CQL and IQL emphasize conservative or implicit value learning to avoid overestimation and exploit imperfect datasets. These insights directly motivate replacing or supplementing RTG-conditioned training with critic-driven policy improvement during finetuning.\nBy unifying DT\u2019s sequence modeling with TD3\u2019s deterministic actor-critic gradients\u2014grounded in DPG theory and supported by advantage/value-centric offline RL results\u2014the paper explains and demonstrates why injecting RL gradients reliably improves online finetuning, particularly when pretraining used low-reward trajectories.",
