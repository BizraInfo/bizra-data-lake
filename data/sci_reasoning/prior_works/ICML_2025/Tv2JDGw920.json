IRM set the objective-level foundation for avoiding spurious correlations by favoring invariant predictors across environments, while Fishr advanced gradient-centric DG by aligning gradient statistics across domains. GENIE builds on this gradient perspective but moves from domain-level alignment to a fine-grained, parameter-wise signal that captures both loss-reduction contribution and gradient alignment after one update.\nMAML and SAM provide the methodological precedent for leveraging one-step lookahead signals: MAML as a meta-objective evaluating post-update performance, and SAM as a flatness-oriented one-step neighborhood evaluation to improve generalization. GENIE adopts the one-step lens but repurposes it as OSGR to steer optimization via per-parameter scaling rather than meta-updates or sharpness penalties.\nFinally, GradNorm, LARS, and Path-SGD contribute the optimization principle of preventing dominance\u2014equalizing influence across tasks (GradNorm), layers (LARS), or parameterizations (Path-SGD). GENIE synthesizes this egalitarian ethos with DG\u2019s gradient-alignment agenda by preconditioning updates to equalize OSGR across parameters, thereby curbing overconfident or domain-specific weights and promoting domain-invariant feature learning.",
