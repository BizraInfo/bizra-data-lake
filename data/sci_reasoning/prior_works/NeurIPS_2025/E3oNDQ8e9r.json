  "synthesis_narrative": "GSRF\u2019s core contribution\u2014bringing efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting to the RF domain with complex-valued fields and a hybrid Fourier\u2013Legendre basis\u2014rests on three converging lines of prior work. First, 3D Gaussian Splatting (Kerbl et al.) provides the central point-based scene representation and real-time rasterization pipeline that GSRF adapts from optical radiance to RF amplitudes and phases. The classical splatting literature (Zwicker et al.) underpins GSRF\u2019s orthographic splatting and efficient ray\u2013Gaussian intersection strategies, enabling scalable culling, visibility, and accumulation with anisotropic kernels.\n\nSecond, NeRF (Mildenhall et al.) established the volumetric rendering objective and data-consistency formulation that early RF synthesis methods inherited. GSRF explicitly targets NeRF\u2019s bottlenecks (long training and high inference latency) by replacing dense ray marching with splat-based rendering, a direction also motivated by the efficiency agenda exemplified by Instant-NGP (M\u00fcller et al.).\n\nThird, GSRF\u2019s complex-valued modeling and directional basis derive from signal-processing and rendering bases. The Legendre/Spherical Harmonic foundations (Ramamoorthi & Hanrahan) inform GSRF\u2019s directional modeling on the sphere, while Fourier features (Tancik et al.) motivate an explicit frequency-domain parameterization to capture high-frequency, phase-sensitive RF effects. To learn amplitude and phase robustly, GSRF relies on established practices in complex-valued deep learning (Trabelsi et al.), enabling stable optimization with complex arithmetic and losses. Together, these works directly inform GSRF\u2019s representation (complex Gaussians), parameterization (Fourier\u2013Legendre), and rendering (orthographic splatting), yielding fast, high-fidelity RF data synthesis.",
