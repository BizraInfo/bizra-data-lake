  "synthesis_narrative": "Latent Diffusion Models established that training and sampling a diffusion model in the latent space of a learned autoencoder preserves image fidelity while drastically cutting compute, with a KL-regularized autoencoding objective designed for perceptual quality. Cascaded Diffusion Models introduced a base-and-super-resolution pipeline that decomposes image synthesis into stages to improve fidelity and scalability. DALL\u00b7E 2 showed that conditioning image synthesis on an image-space semantic representation\u2014by learning a text-to-image-embedding prior and then decoding that embedding\u2014yields strong text alignment and controllability, though its decoder still denoises in pixel space. Imagen demonstrated that cascaded pixel-space diffusion with powerful language encoders can deliver state-of-the-art photorealism but at very high data and compute costs. VQGAN earlier showed that perceptual and adversarial regularization can maintain semantic structure even at strong compression, making compact spatial codes viable for downstream generative modeling.\nTogether, these works reveal that (1) image-space semantic guidance improves alignment, (2) cascades boost fidelity, and (3) latent-space diffusion is far more compute-efficient\u2014yet prior systems either decode in pixel space or rely on relatively large latents. W\u00fcrstchen synthesizes these insights by learning an extremely compact, spatial semantic image latent and running the entire cascade within that latent hierarchy: a text-to-latent prior for semantics, a latent super-resolution stage, then decoding to pixels. This design retains the rich guidance of an image representation while leveraging latent diffusion\u2019s efficiency, closing the quality\u2013compute gap highlighted by Imagen and beating the Stable Diffusion baseline at a fraction of the training cost.",

    "abstract": "We introduce W\u00fcrstchen, a novel architecture for text-to-image synthesis that combines competitive performance with unprecedented cost-effectiveness for large-scale text-to-image diffusion models.\nA key contribution of our work is to develop a latent diffusion technique in which we learn a detailed but extremely compact semantic image representation used to guide the diffusion process. This highly compressed representation of an image provides much more detailed guidance compared to latent representations of language and this significantly reduces the computational requirements to achieve state-of-the-art results. Our approach also improves the quality of text-conditioned image generation based on our user preference study.\nThe training requirements of our approach consists of 24,602 A100-GPU hours - compared to Stable Diffusion 2.1's 200,000 GPU hours.  \nOur approach also requires less training data to achieve these results. Furthermore, our compact latent representations allows us to",
