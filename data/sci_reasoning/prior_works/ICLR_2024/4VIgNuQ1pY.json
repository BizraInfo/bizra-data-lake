  "synthesis_narrative": "Neural Ordinary Differential Equations introduced a continuous-time neural modeling paradigm and adjoint training that supports learning latent dynamics over irregularly sampled trajectories. Latent ODEs then adapted this idea to real-world time series with irregular intervals and missingness, formalizing a latent-variable training setup that integrates continuous dynamics into the encoder\u2013decoder pipeline. Neural Stochastic Differential Equations provided the stochastic counterpart by parameterizing drift and diffusion with neural networks, enabling noisy latent dynamics but exposing the model to mathematical pitfalls of generic, unconstrained coefficients. Classical SDE theory clarified when solutions exist and discretizations behave: Higham, Mao, and Stuart identified one-sided Lipschitz and linear-growth conditions ensuring strong solutions and stable Euler-type convergence. Conversely, Hutzenthaler, Jentzen, and Kloeden showed Euler\u2013Maruyama can diverge under non-globally Lipschitz coefficients\u2014precisely the regime neural nets often inhabit\u2014highlighting the danger of na\u00efvely parameterized neural SDEs. Their subsequent tamed Euler work proved that appropriately structured coefficient growth restores stability and convergence for explicit schemes. Together these results revealed a gap: while latent continuous-time models handle irregular sampling, and neural SDEs add stochasticity, unconstrained neural drift/diffusion choices jeopardize existence and numerical stability. The present work synthesizes these insights by designing neural parameter classes that encode one-sided Lipschitz, linear-growth, and taming-like properties, yielding Neural SDEs that remain well-posed and numerically stable on irregular time series while retaining the expressivity and training pipeline of latent continuous-time models.",

    "abstract": "Irregular sampling intervals and missing values in real-world time series data present challenges for conventional methods that assume consistent intervals and complete data. Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) offer an alternative approach, utilizing neural networks combined with ODE solvers to learn continuous latent representations through parameterized vector fields. Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) extend Neural ODEs by incorporating a diffusion term, although this addition is not trivial, particularly when addressing irregular intervals and missing values. Consequently, careful design of drift and diffusion functions is crucial for maintaining stability and enhancing performance, while incautious choices can result in adverse properties such as the absence of strong solutions, stochastic destabilization, or unstable Euler discretizations, significantly affecting Neural SDEs' performance.
