  "synthesis_narrative": "GeoRCG\u2019s core idea\u2014first generate an informative geometric representation, then condition an equivariant 3D generator on it\u2014emerges from two converging lines of work. On the 3D molecule side, Equivariant Diffusion for Molecule Generation in 3D established E(3)-equivariant diffusion as the de facto backbone for atomic positions and types, while GeoDiff and GeoMol demonstrated that internal geometric parameterizations (e.g., torsions, distances) are simpler targets than raw coordinates. These works collectively suggested that geometry-aware factorization improves learnability but left open principled, goal-directed conditional generation of full molecules. Concurrently, guidance and two-stage strategies in diffusion for images\u2014Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance, Cascaded Diffusion Models, and Latent Diffusion Models\u2014showed that sampling can be steered by generating an easier intermediate (labels/low-res/latent) and conditioning a powerful generator on it. GeoRCG unifies these insights in the molecular domain: it learns a geometry-sufficient, easy-to-generate representation that admits theoretical guarantees (sufficiency up to E(3) symmetries), and then conditions a strong equivariant generator (e.g., EDM) on this representation to drive high-quality, goal-oriented molecule synthesis. By addressing the gap highlighted by torsional/conformation-focused methods\u2014lack of controllable, property-conditional molecule generation\u2014GeoRCG provides a general, plug-in conditioning framework that elevates state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion/flow baselines.",
