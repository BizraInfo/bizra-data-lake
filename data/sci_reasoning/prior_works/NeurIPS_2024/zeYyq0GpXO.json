  "synthesis_narrative": "This paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014disentangling positional vectors from hidden states to explain and extend LLM context windows\u2014rests on two intertwined threads: how position is encoded in attention and how long-context behavior can be enabled without retraining. RoFormer introduced rotary position embedding (RoPE), the de facto positional scheme in modern LLMs; its geometric rotation of queries/keys is precisely the object of the paper\u2019s mean-based decomposition. Shaw et al. and Transformer-XL provided the conceptual and empirical grounding that relative positional information acts directly in attention scores and can support longer-range dependencies, which the paper leverages to analyze how extracted positional vectors modulate attention within and beyond the trained window.\nALiBi and Position Interpolation demonstrated that simple, training-free adjustments to positional signals or attention biases can yield length extrapolation. Building on this insight, the paper proposes two training-free methods\u2014positional vector replacement (a hidden-state analogue of reparameterizing position inputs) and attention window extension (modifying attention behavior)\u2014to extend context windows. StreamingLLM further validates that inference-time manipulation of attention can preserve model capability on long inputs, directly echoing the paper\u2019s attention-focused extension strategy.\nFinally, mechanistic interpretability work on induction heads shows that attention heads encode positional-offset-sensitive circuits. This motivates the paper\u2019s decomposition analysis, clarifying how positional vectors are formed and how they drive attention patterns as sequences exceed the context window, thereby unifying interpretability with practical, training-free long-context extension.",
