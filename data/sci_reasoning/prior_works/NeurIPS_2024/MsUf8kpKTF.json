  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014a systematic characterization of plasticity loss in on-policy deep RL under domain shift and the identification of \u201cregenerative\u201d interventions as robust remedies\u2014rests on three intellectual pillars. First, the on-policy RL substrate is defined by PPO, the standard algorithmic context where the authors measure plasticity degradation and test interventions. Second, prior evidence that deep RL can become biased toward early experiences (primacy bias) directly motivates probing plasticity specifically in the on-policy regime, while classic continual learning methods such as EWC and policy consolidation (Progress & Compress) provide natural baselines for stability\u2013plasticity trade-offs. The paper shows that these regularization/distillation approaches, successful in other regimes, often fail to recover plasticity on-policy under domain shift, sharpening the problem statement.\nThird, a line of work on rejuvenation and restarts\u2014Lottery Ticket Hypothesis/rewinding, SGDR warm restarts, and Population Based Training\u2014establishes that reinitialization and periodic resets can restore trainability and exploration. Building on this, the authors identify a class of regenerative methods (e.g., parameter/optimizer resets or partial reinitialization) that consistently mitigate plasticity loss in on-policy training. Together, these works frame the phenomenon, supply rigorous baselines, and inspire the key insight: in on-policy deep RL, plasticity is better recovered by regeneration-style interventions than by conventional regularization-based continual learning methods.",
