  "synthesis_narrative": "HDM\u2019s core contribution\u2014extending score-based generative modeling to stochastic evolution equations on Hilbert spaces\u2014sits at the intersection of modern diffusion modeling and classical stochastic analysis in infinite dimensions. Song et al. (2021) supplied the continuous-time SDE formulation of diffusion models and the reverse-time SDE viewpoint, which HDM generalizes from finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces to Hilbert-space SEEs. This generalization hinges on time-reversal theory: Anderson (1982) and Haussmann\u2013Pardoux (1986) provide the foundational reverse-time formulas for diffusions that HDM extends to infinite-dimensional settings, yielding a new reverse-time expression for SEEs. To make this extension mathematically sound, HDM relies on the SEE/SPDE framework of Da Prato & Zabczyk (2014), including semigroups/evolution operators and mild solutions, which allow formulating both forward and reverse dynamics in Hilbert spaces. On the learning side, HDM inherits practical training protocols from DDPM (Ho et al., 2020) and denoising score matching (Vincent, 2011), adapting noise-conditioned score learning to function spaces. Finally, to parameterize mappings between functions inherent in Hilbert-space scores and operator-driven dynamics, HDM leverages the Fourier Neural Operator (Li et al., 2020), enabling scalable operator learning and capturing transformations like image/function-to-function drifts. Together, these works directly inform HDM\u2019s theoretical bridge (time reversal in Hilbert spaces), its probabilistic modeling template (score-based diffusion), and its implementable parameterization (neural operators) for generative modeling of functional data.",
