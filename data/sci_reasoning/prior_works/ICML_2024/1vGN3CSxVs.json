  "synthesis_narrative": "EquiPocket emerges at the intersection of two lines of work: surface-based pocket modeling and E(3)-equivariant geometric learning. Early deep-learning pocket predictors such as DeepSite framed the task as 3D voxel segmentation, but their reliance on voxel grids created brittleness to rotations and difficulty representing highly irregular molecular surfaces\u2014limitations EquiPocket explicitly seeks to overcome. MaSIF reframed binding-site prediction onto the protein surface, showing that surface geometry and chemistry drive recognition, while dMaSIF made this surface paradigm fast and mesh-free on point clouds and included a site-prediction head. EquiPocket directly extends this surface-learning lineage by replacing invariant surface descriptors with explicit E(3)-equivariant message passing over surface atoms, capturing local and global geometry consistently under rotations.\nConcurrently, advances in equivariant GNNs provided the algorithmic backbone. EGNN introduced simple, tensor-free E(n)-equivariant message passing on point clouds, which EquiPocket adapts to atomic surface graphs to ensure physically meaningful transformations of features and coordinates. GVP-GNN showed how to co-represent chemical information and 3D geometry via coupled scalar\u2013vector channels, informing EquiPocket\u2019s design for jointly modeling chemical and spatial structure. Finally, EquiBind demonstrated that E(3)-equivariant GNNs materially improve protein\u2013ligand tasks, reinforcing the choice of equivariance for robust pocket detection. Together, these works directly shaped EquiPocket\u2019s core innovation: an E(3)-equivariant, surface-centric GNN that unifies local geometric extraction, chemical\u2013spatial modeling, and equivariant message passing to predict ligand binding sites.",
