  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of Maximum Entropy Goal-directedness (MEG) is to turn the intuitive notion that \u201cgoal-directed behavior looks like purposeful planning\u201d into a computable, principled measure within both causal models and MDPs. This builds most directly on the maximum causal entropy lineage from inverse reinforcement learning: Ziebart\u2019s MaxEnt IRL and maximum causal entropy formulations supply the probabilistic model over trajectories under soft-optimal control and the dynamic programming algorithms MEG adapts to score how well behavior is explained by utility-driven action. Complementing this, Bayesian IRL and inverse planning (Ramachandran & Amir; Baker et al.) motivate reasoning over uncertainty in the utility and interpreting behavior as evidence about latent goals; MEG operationalizes this by measuring goal-directedness relative to a known utility, a hypothesis class of utilities, or sets of variables. On the structural side, Pearl\u2019s causal modeling framework underwrites MEG\u2019s definition in causal models, grounding interventions and dependencies needed to reference goal variables beyond standard MDP state-action dynamics. Puterman\u2019s MDP foundations provide the canonical decision-theoretic setting and computational toolkit for MEG\u2019s MDP instantiation. Finally, causal influence diagrams (Carey, Everitt, Langlois) clarify how to represent utilities and incentives within causal graphs, aligning with MEG\u2019s emphasis on specifying goal variables and desiderata for what counts as goal-oriented behavior. Together, these strands yield a measure that is principled, computable, and comparable across domains.",
