  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014an ML-powered ICA that jointly exploits value and demand queries\u2014rests on two pillars: the practical centrality of demand-query ICAs and the theoretical link between prices, demand, and values. Foundational ICA work by Parkes and the ascending-package/CCA designs of Ausubel, Milgrom, and Cramton established demand queries and price adjustment as the operative interface in real markets, motivating an ML design that must learn from demand, not just values. On the theory side, Nisan\u2013Segal and Bikhchandani\u2013Ostroy formalized how price-supported equilibria and demand responses encode bidders\u2019 preferences, offering the blueprint for provably extracting information from demand alongside values. \n\nThe immediate antecedent is the MLCA line (Brero\u2013Lahaie\u2013Lubin\u2013Seuken), which demonstrated that predictive models and active elicitation can markedly accelerate value-query ICAs\u2014but remained value-only. Complementing this, algorithmic results like Dobzinski\u2013Nisan underscored the power of demand queries for welfare approximation, reinforcing that a value-only ML approach leaves substantial information untapped. \n\nSynthesizing these strands, the present work designs learning targets and update rules that fuse value observations with demand-at-prices, proving that both signals can be fully exploited within one estimator and then embedding this into a hybrid auction (MLHCA). The result is an ICA that aligns with practice (demand queries), augments it with value-query learning when useful, and empirically achieves large efficiency gains over prior MLCA-style baselines.",
