  "synthesis_narrative": "Message-passing simulators showed that local interactions on graphs can approximate spatial derivatives and, when wrapped in explicit integrators, yield long-horizon rollouts of complex dynamics on irregular domains; MeshGraphNets further specialized this to mesh-based PDE simulation, conditioning messages on geometry and boundaries. Message Passing Neural PDE Solver then aligned the learned messages with discrete PDE stencils, demonstrating that embedding discretization structure into message passing improves stability and accuracy while reducing data needs. In parallel, the neural-operator line framed PDE solution as learning a map between function spaces, with the Fourier Neural Operator delivering strong cross-parameter generalization but struggling with irregular meshes and intricate boundary conditions. Physics-Informed Neural Networks introduced training directly against PDE residuals and boundary/initial-condition penalties, and Physics-Informed Neural Operator showed that injecting these physics losses into operator learning substantially boosts data efficiency and reliability.\nBuilding on these threads, the opportunity emerged to marry graph-based simulators\u2019 geometric flexibility with the data efficiency of physics-informed training and the structural stability of discretization-aware messages. The present work synthesizes these ideas by encoding PDE operators and boundary conditions directly into message functions, training with physics residuals, and integrating the GNN within a numerical time-marching scheme. This combination preserves mesh generality and parameter robustness, while mitigating data hunger and improving extrapolation\u2014naturally advancing the learned-simulator paradigm toward reliable spatiotemporal PDE modeling under irregular meshes, complex boundaries, and diverse coefficients.",

    "abstract": "Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) serves as a cornerstone for modeling complex dynamical systems. Recent progresses have demonstrated grand benefits of data-driven neural-based models for predicting spatiotemporal dynamics (e.g., tremendous speedup gain compared with classical numerical methods). However, most existing neural models rely on rich training data, have limited extrapolation and generalization abilities, and suffer to produce precise or reliable physical prediction under intricate conditions (e.g., irregular mesh or geometry, complex boundary conditions, diverse PDE parameters, etc.). To this end, we propose a new graph learning approach, namely, Physics-encoded Message Passing Graph Network (PhyMPGN), to model spatiotemporal PDE systems on irregular meshes given small training datasets. Specifically, we incorporate a GNN into a numerical integrator to approximate the temporal marching of spatiotemporal dynamics for a given PDE system. Considering that many phys",
