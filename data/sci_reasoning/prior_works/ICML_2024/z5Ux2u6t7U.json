  "synthesis_narrative": "DITTO\u2019s core innovation\u2014training-free, inference-time control of text-to-music diffusion models via optimization of the initial noise latent\u2014emerges from a confluence of ideas in diffusion guidance, inverse problems, and latent diffusion for audio. DDIM provided the crucial deterministic sampler that makes the reverse process differentiable end-to-end, enabling gradients from a task objective to flow back to the starting noise. Building on the principle of inference-time guidance introduced by Dhariwal and Nichol, DITTO generalizes beyond classifier or textual guidance to any differentiable feature-matching loss (e.g., semantic, melodic, or structural objectives), but crucially shifts the optimization target from per-step states to the initial noise, yielding substantial computational and memory benefits. The inverse-problem viewpoint championed by Diffusion Posterior Sampling highlighted the power of training-free constraints but also its inefficiency due to stepwise gradient updates\u2014precisely the gap DITTO closes with initial-noise optimization plus memory-efficient checkpointing. In application, RePaint had established a training-free inpainting/outpainting baseline; DITTO surpasses it by directly optimizing toward user-defined audio features for stronger controllability and quality. Finally, AudioLDM and Riffusion anchored diffusion as a practical backbone for text-to-audio/music, providing the pre-trained models that DITTO can steer without fine-tuning. Together, these works directly shape DITTO\u2019s formulation and demonstrate how optimizing x_T unifies flexible control with efficiency across music generation tasks.",
