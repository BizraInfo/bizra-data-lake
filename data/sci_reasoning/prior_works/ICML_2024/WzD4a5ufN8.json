  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper sits squarely in the lineage of graph-network simulators for physics. Sanchez-Gonzalez et al. established the GN-based simulation framework, and Pfaff et al.\u2019s MeshGraphNet adapted it to mesh-based CFD, becoming the de facto baseline. However, MGN-style methods pass predominantly local, topology-based features and overlook finite-volume attributes that govern conservation on practical CFD meshes, as well as lack global awareness of immersed objects. Brandstetter et al. highlighted that message passing can be tailored to numerical discretizations, motivating a discretization-aware treatment; the present work operationalizes this for the finite volume method by embedding cell volumes and face areas/centroids directly in the messages. In parallel, operator-learning advances such as FNO\u2014and especially its geometry-informed variant Geo-FNO\u2014demonstrated that global geometry encodings (e.g., masks/SDFs) are crucial when handling complex domains but were developed for regular grids. This paper transfers that insight to unstructured, finite-volume meshes through two mesh-native, global geometry descriptors: Shortest Vector (SV), akin to an SDF vectorial analogue, and Directional Integrated Distance (DID), which aggregates distance information along directions to capture obstacle context. Finally, inspired by directional message passing ideas exemplified by DimeNet, DID injects directional structure into the geometry cues. Together, these lineage threads directly enable the paper\u2019s core contributions: FVM-aware GNN message passing and globally informed geometry representations for accurate, data-efficient CFD surrogates.",
