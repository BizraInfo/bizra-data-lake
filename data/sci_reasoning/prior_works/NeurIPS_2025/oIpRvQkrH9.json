  "synthesis_narrative": "Neptune-X\u2019s core contribution\u2014a data-centric generative-selection framework for universal maritime object detection\u2014emerges at the intersection of modern diffusion-based synthesis, explicit boundary modeling, and task-aware sample selection. Latent Diffusion Models provided the computationally efficient backbone for high-fidelity image generation, while ControlNet demonstrated how to inject multiple structural modalities to precisely steer synthesis. Together, they enable Neptune-X\u2019s multi-modality-conditioned X-to-Maritime generator to produce diverse, realistic scenes that respect geometry and context.\n\nOn the structural side, SPADE\u2019s spatially adaptive conditioning highlighted the importance of preserving semantic layout and crisp boundaries during generation. This perspective directly supports Neptune-X\u2019s Bidirectional Object-Water Attention, which targets the notoriously challenging object\u2013water interface by explicitly modeling interactions across the boundary to improve visual fidelity and downstream detectability.\n\nFor improving task performance, Meta-Sim established the principle of learning synthetic data distributions tailored to downstream objectives, and domain randomization emphasized diversity as a route to sim-to-real robustness. Neptune-X integrates these ideas but goes further with Attribute-correlated Active Sampling: inspired by task-aware subset selection methods like GLISTER, it dynamically selects synthetic samples aligned with attribute distributions (category, viewpoint, location, environment) that most influence detector generalization. The emphasis on boundary-sensitive features echoes Gated-SCNN\u2019s explicit shape/edge modeling, ensuring that generated content retains detection-critical contours. Collectively, these threads yield a unified pipeline where controllable, boundary-faithful generation is coupled with principled, task-aware selection to close the maritime data and generalization gaps.",
