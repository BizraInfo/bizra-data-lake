  "synthesis_narrative": "Trajectory diffusion for decision making established that generative models can synthesize feasible, multi-modal behaviors when trained on trajectory data, with Planning with Diffusion showing how to sample and refine trajectories for control. Decision Diffuser further demonstrated how conditioning and guidance could steer diffusion rollouts toward task objectives, and Diffusion Policy validated that single-robot action/trajectory diffusion learned from demonstrations can be robust and sample-efficient in robotics. In parallel, classical multi-robot planning developed principled ways to decouple and recouple agents: M* introduced subdimensional expansion that plans independently and only couples robots near conflicts, while Conflict-Based Search formalized resolving collisions as a high-level constraint search over individual plans. Bridging learning and search, Learning Sampling Distributions for Motion Planning showed learned generative priors can bias planners while search guarantees constraint satisfaction. Finally, Compositional Diffusion demonstrated that multiple diffusion models can be combined via score/product-of-experts composition to represent conjunctions of constraints or concepts.\nTaken together, these works revealed a path to scalable multi-robot planning: use single-robot diffusion as powerful data-driven priors, rely on search to enforce hard inter-robot collision constraints without training a joint model, and compose multiple specialized diffusions to cover large, heterogeneous environments. The current paper synthesizes these insights by coupling per-robot diffusion generation with conflict-driven search in the spirit of M* and CBS, and by leveraging composable diffusion to scale across environment partitions\u2014addressing the sample complexity and generalization limits that kept diffusion-based robotics largely confined to single-robot, small-scale settings.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have recently been successfully applied to a wide range of robotics applications for learning complex multi-modal behaviors from data. However, prior works have mostly been confined to single-robot and small-scale environments due to the high sample complexity of learning multi-robot diffusion models. In this paper, we propose a method for generating collision-free multi-robot trajectories that conform to underlying data distributions while using only single-robot data. Our algorithm, Multi-robot Multi-model planning Diffusion (MMD), does so by combining learned diffusion models with classical search-based techniques---generating data-driven motions under collision constraints. Scaling further, we show how to compose multiple diffusion models to plan in large environments where a single diffusion model fails to generalize well. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in planning for dozens of robots in a variety of simulated scenarios motivated by logistics en",
