  "synthesis_narrative": "Neural Pfaffians sits at the intersection of two lines of progress: neural variational wavefunctions for continuum electrons and pairing-based antisymmetric ans\u00e4tze from quantum Monte Carlo. FermiNet (Pfau et al., 2020) and PauliNet (Hermann et al., 2020) proved that deep networks with backflow-like transformations and Slater determinants can achieve chemical accuracy, but they typically train per-system and depend on spin-partitioned determinants and orbital choices, limiting transfer across molecules and spin sectors. The backflow literature (L\u00f3pez R\u00edos et al., 2006) provided the variational mechanism that these neural methods adopted to improve nodal surfaces, while Carleo and Troyer (2017) established the general viability of neural quantum states.\n\nOn the antisymmetry front, the QMC community showed that pairing forms\u2014AGP/JAGP (Casula et al., 2004)\u2014and their generalization to Pfaffians (Bajdich et al., 2008) offer a compact, flexible representation that naturally accommodates arbitrary spin configurations and strong correlation beyond single-determinant Slater forms. Neural Pfaffians directly fuses these insights: it replaces determinant-based antisymmetry with a fully learnable Pfaffian layer, retaining the expressive, learnable coordinate transformations of neural VMC while eliminating non-learnable, discrete orbital selection and spin-factorization constraints. This Pfaffian-based architecture is overparameterized and suitable for amortization across molecular geometries and compositions, addressing the core limitation identified by determinant-based neural wavefunctions. In short, Neural Pfaffians operationalizes the established advantages of Pfaffian/pairing ans\u00e4tze within the modern NQS framework to deliver a transferable, end-to-end learnable antisymmetric wavefunction across diverse many-electron systems.",
