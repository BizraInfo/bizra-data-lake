  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014semi-supervised confidence distribution learning (ssCDL) for uncertain knowledge graph (UKG) completion\u2014sits at the intersection of uncertainty-aware KG embeddings and distribution-based supervision. Prior UKG methods, most notably UKGE, formulated UKG completion as embedding learning with pointwise confidence regression. While effective, such point targets struggle when confidence values are extremely imbalanced. KG2E earlier demonstrated that modeling uncertainty via distributions at the representation level can be beneficial, signaling that distributional treatments can better capture uncertainty than point estimates. In parallel, the probabilistic perspective on KGs from Knowledge Graph Identification established that facts can and should carry soft truth/confidence, grounding the need to predict more than binary truth.\nLabel Distribution Learning (LDL) provides the direct methodological precedent for ssCDL: replacing a single label with a label distribution yields richer supervision and improved robustness\u2014precisely what ssCDL exploits by converting each triple\u2019s confidence into a confidence distribution. The efficacy of soft targets popularized by knowledge distillation further supports ssCDL\u2019s choice to supervise with distributions that encode relationships among nearby confidence levels, rather than hard or single-point targets. Finally, ssCDL\u2019s iterative use of unlabeled triples is rooted in classic semi-supervised learning via pseudo-labeling, adapted here to relational data and distributional labels. Together, these works lead naturally to ssCDL\u2019s design: distributional supervision to mitigate confidence imbalance and semi-supervised training to exploit incomplete UKGs, yielding stronger embeddings and higher-quality UKG completion.",
