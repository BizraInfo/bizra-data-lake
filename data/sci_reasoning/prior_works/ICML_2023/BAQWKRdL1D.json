  "synthesis_narrative": "Sketch-Flip-Merge sits at the intersection of mergeable distinct-count sketches and differential privacy. The lineage begins with Flajolet\u2013Martin\u2019s bitmap sketches, which introduced OR-merge semantics for distinct counting, and HyperLogLog, which established the dominant practical, mergeable sketch used in data warehouses. Building on this sketching-and-merging paradigm, Ertl\u2019s likelihood-based analyses showed how to attain provably optimal estimation for HLL-style summaries, a blueprint that Sketch-Flip-Merge adapts to the DP-perturbed setting to achieve optimal estimation under noise. On the privacy side, RAPPOR demonstrated that randomized response on bit vectors enables aggregatable analytics from noisy bits. Sketch-Flip-Merge draws directly on this idea but goes further, introducing a new randomized algorithm that performs logical operations (e.g., OR/merge) on already-noisy bits, ensuring that the result is distributed as if one had first merged the true sketches and then applied a single DP randomizer. Theoretical treatments of distinct counting and streaming (Kane\u2013Nelson\u2013Woodruff) solidified the F0 problem and mergeability goals, while pan-private streaming results (Dwork et al.) highlighted the accuracy and practicality gaps of prior private approaches for distinct counts. Finally, the characterization of optimal binary mechanisms in local DP (Kairouz\u2013Oh\u2013Viswanath) informs Sketch-Flip-Merge\u2019s tight privacy analysis of its flip mechanism, enabling the first practical, mergeable, differentially private sketches with low empirical error.",
