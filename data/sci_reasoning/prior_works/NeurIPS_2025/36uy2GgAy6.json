  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core advance\u2014minimax-optimal correlation estimation when X and Y are split across two privacy-constrained servers\u2014rests on the modern local differential privacy (LDP) minimax program and information-constrained inference. Duchi, Jordan, and Wainwright established the channel-based LDP framework and separation between interactive and non-interactive protocols, which this work extends to a vertically partitioned two-server model with heterogeneous (\u03b5,\u03b4) budgets, translating their paradigm to cross-moment estimation needed for correlation. Acharya, Canonne, and Tyagi\u2019s chi-square contraction method supplies a flexible lower-bound toolkit that directly supports the paper\u2019s rate-optimality claims and its comparisons of interaction benefits under asymmetric privacy. On the constructive side, Kairouz, Oh, and Viswanath\u2019s extremal-mechanism results inform the choice of per-server privatization for low-order moments (means and second moments), yielding near-optimal noise-accuracy tradeoffs in both non-interactive and interactive designs. At the mechanism level, Warner\u2019s randomized response provides robust primitives for privatizing binary transforms (e.g., signs/thresholded features) that enable unbiased cross-moment estimation when raw pairs cannot be shared. For inference, Sheffet\u2019s techniques for privately estimating covariance/OLS and forming valid confidence intervals guide the development of debiased correlation estimators with quantifiable uncertainty under injected noise. Finally, Bassily and Smith\u2019s results on optimal non-interactive LDP aggregation anchor the analysis of one-shot protocols, clarifying when interaction is necessary. Together, these works directly enable the paper\u2019s unified characterization of minimax rates and practical procedures for correlation across privacy barriers.",
