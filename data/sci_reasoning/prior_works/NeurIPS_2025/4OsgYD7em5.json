  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper interrogates a prominent narrative from recent RL-with-verifiable-rewards (RLVR) systems\u2014exemplified by DeepSeek-R1 and GRPO\u2014that reinforcement learning alone can unlock new reasoning abilities beyond a base model. Methodologically, its evaluation bedrock is the pass@k protocol introduced in Codex, extended here to large-k to approximate an upper bound on a model\u2019s latent competence. This approach is directly informed by Self-Consistency, which showed that diverse multi-sample decoding can surface correct chains of thought without changing the underlying model, hinting that higher performance might reflect sampling efficiency rather than new reasoning skills.\nVerifier-driven supervision in Let\u2019s Verify Step by Step underpins the RLVR reward design the authors study across math, coding, and visual reasoning. InstructGPT contributes the RL fine-tuning template (policy optimization against a learned/reward signal) that current RLVR variants adapt, letting the authors compare across RL algorithms, including GRPO-style objectives popularized in reasoning-focused RL.\nFinally, Tree of Thoughts clarifies the role of test-time exploration versus learned capability. Synthesizing these threads, the paper designs a systematic probe: hold base models fixed, vary RL algorithms and tasks with verifiable rewards, and measure pass@k at large k. The central finding\u2014that RLVR chiefly improves the likelihood of sampling existing correct trajectories rather than inducing fundamentally new reasoning patterns\u2014emerges precisely from these prior insights on verifiable supervision, RL fine-tuning, and sampling-based evaluations.",
