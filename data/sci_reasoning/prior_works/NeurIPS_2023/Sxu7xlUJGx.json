  "synthesis_narrative": "Uppal et al. build on the idea of modeling posteriors via learned neural transports popularized by normalizing flows, but they switch from explicit, change-of-variables models (Rezende & Mohamed, 2015) to implicit neural samplers that do not require tractable densities. Prior attempts to make implicit variational inference workable typically relied on adversarial density-ratio estimation, as in Adversarial Variational Bayes (Mescheder et al., 2017) and the likelihood-free VI framework for hierarchical implicit models (Tran et al., 2017). While effective, these approaches introduce instability and additional discriminator networks. The present paper\u2019s core innovation is a non-adversarial objective: by locally linearizing the neural sampler, they derive tractable bounds that circumvent discriminator training and density-ratio estimation, directly addressing key pain points identified in earlier implicit VI work.\n\nMethodologically, their optimization leverages the reparameterization philosophy extended to implicit distributions (Figurnov et al., 2018), allowing scalable gradient-based learning even when densities are not available. On the application side, the work is motivated by the known shortcomings of mean-field variational BNNs (Blundell et al., 2015) and the demonstrated value of structured, correlation-aware posteriors in BNNs (Louizos & Welling, 2017). By pairing implicit samplers with linearization-based bounds and differentiable numerical approximations, the authors deliver the first implicit variational method capable of handling tens of millions of latent variables while recovering crucial cross-layer correlations in large BNNs\u2014achieving the expressivity of neural transports without the fragility of adversarial objectives.",
