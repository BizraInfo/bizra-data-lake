  "synthesis_narrative": "Auditing Fairness by Betting fuses the fairness-auditing problem with the modern, game-theoretic view of statistical evidence to deliver sequential, nonparametric, and off-policy valid tests. Shafer\u2019s Testing by Betting and the Shafer\u2013Vovk game-theoretic foundations supply the core idea of representing evidence as a bettor\u2019s wealth via nonnegative supermartingales. This makes test outcomes interpretable and, crucially, yields validity under optional stopping and policy shifts\u2014properties essential for continuous monitoring in deployed systems. Building on this conceptual base, Howard\u2013Ramdas\u2013McAuliffe\u2013Sekhon develop time-uniform concentration and confidence sequences from supermartingale techniques, which the paper uses to track evolving fairness gaps without fixed sample sizes or asymptotics. Complementary to this, Gr\u00fcnwald\u2013de Heide\u2013Koolen\u2019s Safe Testing and Vovk\u2013Wang\u2019s work on e-values provide the formal apparatus for constructing and combining e-processes, enabling principled aggregation of evidence across time, metrics, and subgroups. On the application side, Kearns\u2013Neel\u2013Roth\u2013Wu established the auditing lens for subgroup fairness in a batch setting; the present paper extends that ambition to an anytime-valid, streaming regime. Finally, Dud\u00edk\u2013Langford\u2013Li\u2019s off-policy evaluation framework legitimizes the use of importance weighting when data arise from probabilistic logging policies, allowing fairness audits on adaptively collected, repurposed data. Together, these strands yield an auditing methodology that is interpretable, sequential, robust to distribution shift, and applicable under changing, policy-driven data collection.",
