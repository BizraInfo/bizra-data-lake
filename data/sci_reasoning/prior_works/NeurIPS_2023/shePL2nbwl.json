  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014explaining why offline RL can remain performant and safe even under incorrect reward labels\u2014rests on two pillars established by prior work: pessimism and data support constraints. Early batch methods like BCQ and behavior-regularized approaches such as BEAR and BRAC directly tackled extrapolation error by constraining learned policies to remain within (or near) the dataset\u2019s action distribution. Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) sharpened this idea by penalizing out-of-distribution actions at the value-learning level, providing a widely used instantiation of pessimism. Model-based methods like MOReL further operationalized pessimism by assigning low values to uncertain, unsupported regions\u2014effectively creating absorbing low-reward outcomes that discourage venturing beyond the data. Parallel to these algorithmic advances, SPIBB formalized safe policy improvement under limited coverage, highlighting the protective effect of staying close to a baseline where data are scarce. Finally, D4RL standardized offline benchmarks whose coverage is limited and biased in systematic ways.\nTogether, these works created the conditions that the present paper identifies and proves: pessimism induces a long-horizon incentive to remain in the data support\u2014a survival instinct\u2014while the dataset\u2019s biased coverage narrows the set of feasible, supported behaviors. This interplay explains the surprising robustness to reward misspecification observed empirically across offline RL benchmarks and algorithms built on conservative, behavior-anchored principles.",
