  "synthesis_narrative": "Autoregressive graph generators like GraphRNN demonstrated how to synthesize realistic structures by sequentially adding nodes and edges, while NetGAN showed that random-walk distributions can drive plausible edge sampling, establishing strong but static, homogeneous baselines. DyRep introduced continuous-time relational event modeling with conditional intensities over node embeddings to capture when and which typed interactions occur, and Temporal Graph Networks contributed history-aware message passing with temporal memory to encode evolving contexts for dynamic edges. In the privacy domain, PrivBayes pioneered a perturb-then-synthesize pipeline that achieves differential privacy by first privatizing sufficient statistics before training a generator, and PATE-GAN revealed how privatized supervision can be combined with limited information from original data through teacher\u2013student transfer to reclaim utility under DP. For graph-specific privacy, Karwa and Slavkovi\u0107 formalized network-relevant randomized response and edge-DP machinery, while the heterogeneous information network framework of Sun and Han established the schema-level formalism for typed nodes, edges, and meta-relations.\nBringing these strands together reveals a gap: existing generators lack temporality and heterogeneity, DP graph methods target static homogeneous settings, and DP synthetic data techniques don\u2019t capture relational-temporal dependencies. The natural next step is a DP mechanism that perturbs time-stamped, relation-typed edges with proper temporal composition, coupled with a continuous-time, history-aware generator that models typed interactions. By combining a privatized graph view with carefully constrained original-data guidance, one can recover utility and scalability, yielding an efficient, privacy-preserving generator for temporal heterogeneous graphs.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, temporal heterogeneous graphs attract much research and industrial attention for building the next-generation Relational Deep Learning models and applications, due to their informative structures and features. While providing timely and precise services like personalized recommendations and question answering, this rich information also introduces extra exposure risk for each node in the graph. The distinctive local topology, the abundant heterogeneous features, and the time dimension of the graph data are more prone to expose sensitive information and narrow down the scope of victim candidates, which calls for well-defined protection techniques on graphs. To this end, we propose a Temporal Heterogeneous Graph Generator balancing Privacy, Utility, and Efficiency, named THePUff. More specifically, we first propose a differential privacy algorithm to perturb the input temporal heterogeneous graph for protecting privacy, and then utilize both the perturbed graph and the original",
