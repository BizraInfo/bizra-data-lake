  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contributions\u2014proving CLS-completeness for \u03b5-Nash equilibria in 3-player adversarial team games and classifying the complexity of symmetric first-order equilibria in symmetric min-max problems\u2014rest on three pillars: the CLS framework, symmetric-equilibrium hardness for identical-payoff games, and polymatrix-structured reductions.\n\nCLS, introduced by Daskalakis and Papadimitriou, provides the ambient complexity class and completeness notions that the authors target. Recent advances showing CLS-completeness for finding first-order stationary points via gradient-based local search directly connect first-order equilibrium computation to CLS, enabling the paper\u2019s classification of symmetric first-order equilibria. On the equilibrium concept side, the local min-max framework of Jin, Netrapalli, and Jordan supplies the first-order notions of equilibrium (stationarity and symmetry) that the paper studies in nonconvex\u2013nonconcave min-max settings.\n\nThe reduction backbone leverages hardness for symmetric \u03b5-Nash equilibria in symmetric, identical-payoff two-player games established by recent work of Hollender, Maystre, and Nagarajan. The present paper ingeniously employs a single adversarial player to enforce symmetry without distorting payoffs, transporting that hardness to 3-player adversarial team games. Finally, by engineering the reduction entirely within the polymatrix model\u2014rooted in the graphical-game formalism of Kearns, Littman, and Singh and informed by techniques for encoding constraints in polymatrix games\u2014the authors settle the open question posed by Hollender et al., showing that hardness persists under stringent pairwise-interaction structure.",
