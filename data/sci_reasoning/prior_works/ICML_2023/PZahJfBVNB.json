  "synthesis_narrative": "StyleGAN-T sits at the intersection of two lines of work: scalable conditional GANs and modern text-conditioning from diffusion models. The GAN lineage starts with Reed et al., who established the core text-to-image formulation by conditioning both generator and discriminator on language embeddings. BigGAN then showed how to scale conditional GANs to high capacity and introduced practical controls like truncation to navigate the fidelity\u2013diversity tradeoff. Miyato & Koyama\u2019s projection discriminator provided a principled mechanism to inject the conditioning signal into the discriminator\u2014an idea StyleGAN-T directly extends to rich text embeddings to enforce alignment. Most immediately, StyleGAN-XL offered the authors\u2019 own large-scale training recipe and high-capacity style-based generator; StyleGAN-T is explicitly designed to improve upon this baseline by replacing class conditioning with text, strengthening alignment, and maintaining stability on diverse web-scale data.\nConcurrently, diffusion models demonstrated exceptional text alignment via cross-attention and controllable conditioning strength. Latent Diffusion Models popularized injecting token-level text features through cross-attention, and Classifier-Free Guidance introduced a simple inference-time scaling of the conditioning signal to control alignment versus diversity. StyleGAN-T adopts these conditioning concepts within a single-pass GAN, marrying diffusion\u2019s alignment strengths with GAN-speed sampling. Finally, Progressive Distillation defined the previous speed-focused frontier for text-to-image; StyleGAN-T sets its target against this baseline, aiming to surpass distilled diffusion in the fast-generation regime without iterative sampling.",
