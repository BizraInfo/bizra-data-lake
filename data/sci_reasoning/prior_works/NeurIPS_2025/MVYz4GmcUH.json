  "synthesis_narrative": "Ambient Diffusion Omni fuses the ambient-learning idea\u2014training a generative model directly from corrupted observations\u2014with the denoising principles of diffusion. AmbientGAN established that a generator can be trained from lossy measurements by explicitly modeling the corruption pipeline. Omni translates this logic into diffusion training, where denoising losses (DDPM) and the continuous-time SDE view formalize noise as a smoothing operator that simplifies the data distribution, enabling stable score estimation even when inputs are degraded or out-of-distribution. The theoretical grounding for learning from general corruptions comes from regularized/denoising auto-encoder theory, which shows that denoising learns the score of a smoothed density for broad classes of corruption\u2014not just Gaussian noise\u2014directly supporting Omni\u2019s use of JPEG compression, blur, and motion artifacts.\nCrucially, the paper leverages two enduring regularities of natural images. First, the 1/f spectral decay (Ruderman) implies that even low-quality images preserve substantial low-frequency structure; spectral bias in neural training dynamics explains why noise can damp early imbalance and encourage more faithful global structure before finer details are learned. Second, locality and sparse statistics (Simoncelli & Olshausen) ensure that informative local dependencies persist under common degradations, making them recoverable by a denoising objective. Together, these strands justify the central claim: by injecting and exploiting noise within diffusion training, one can distill usable signal from \u201cbad\u201d images and, counterintuitively, train better models\u2014achieving state-of-the-art generative performance while broadening the range of viable training data.",
