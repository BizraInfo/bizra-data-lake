  "synthesis_narrative": "ODS emerges at the intersection of two lines of work: test-time adaptation for covariate shift and label-shift correction. Test-time Training (Sun et al., 2020) established the paradigm of adapting models at test time without source data, while Tent (Wang et al., 2021) supplied a simple, effective objective\u2014entropy minimization\u2014that quickly became the default tool to counter covariate shift. Efficient TTA (Niu et al., 2022) further improved stability and efficiency, yet these TTA methods implicitly assume stationary class priors and degrade when the label distribution changes. In parallel, classic label-shift research (Saerens et al., 2002) and its modern instantiation BBSE (Lipton et al., 2018) showed how to estimate target class priors and adjust predictions under prior shift, but they assume a fixed classifier and typically ignore concurrent covariate shift. SHOT (Liang et al., 2020) reinforced the no-source constraint by demonstrating adaptation using only a source hypothesis, aligning with ODS\u2019s operational setting. ODS\u2019s core innovation\u2014decoupling mixed distribution shift at test time\u2014directly synthesizes these threads: it retains entropy-based adaptation to mitigate covariate shift while explicitly estimating and correcting target priors to handle label shift. By addressing the precise limitation of Tent/EATA under label shift using Saerens/BBSE-style prior correction adapted to the test-time, no-source context, ODS provides a principled framework for open-world data shift.",
