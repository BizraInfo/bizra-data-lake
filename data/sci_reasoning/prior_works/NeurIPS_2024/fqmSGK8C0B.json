  "synthesis_narrative": "The key innovation of DCDC is to transform recent contractive-drift theory into a practical, sample-based calculator of convergence rates in Wasserstein distance. This rests directly on the Qu\u2013Blanchet\u2013Glynn (2023) framework that formulates convergence via a contractive drift certificate; DCDC introduces the Contractive Drift Equation (CDE) embodying that certificate and then solves it numerically. The theoretical lineage of this idea blends three streams: (i) Eberle\u2019s reflection-coupling program, which shows that carefully designed distance-like functions can yield Wasserstein contraction; (ii) Harris-type results in Wasserstein metrics (Hairer\u2013Mattingly\u2013Scheutzow), which combine Lyapunov drift with local contractivity to obtain quantitative ergodicity; and (iii) curvature-based contraction (Ollivier) and drift-plus-contractivity analyses (Butkovsky), which formalize how an appropriate metric induces contraction of the Markov kernel. DCDC\u2019s CDE can be viewed as a computable instantiation of these principles: learn a metric/weight function that enforces contractive drift and then translate it into explicit bounds. On the algorithmic side, path coupling provides the conceptual local-to-global contraction blueprint, while physics-informed neural networks supply a scalable methodology for solving operator equations from samples by minimizing residuals. Together, these works directly shape DCDC\u2019s two components\u2014its contractive-drift formulation and its neural solver\u2014yielding the first general-purpose, sample-based tool to certify convergence of general-state-space Markov chains in Wasserstein distance.",
