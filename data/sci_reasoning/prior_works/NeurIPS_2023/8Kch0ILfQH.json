  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s central insight\u2014decoupling vision-language pre-training by shifting optimization to the language side and learning a prompt-predictor on text alone\u2014emerges from two converging threads. First, recent VL systems using frozen LLMs, notably Flamingo and BLIP-2, proved that a powerful LLM can act as a multimodal decoder if provided with the right visual prompts via an adapter (Perceiver Resampler or Q-Former). LLaVA further showed that lightweight connectors to a largely frozen LLM suffice, reinforcing the view that the LLM should remain untouched while the interface does the heavy lifting. Second, NLP prompt-learning advances\u2014Prefix-Tuning and Prompt Tuning\u2014established that continuous, learnable prompts can effectively steer frozen LMs with minimal parameters and purely text supervision. CoOp extended this prompting paradigm to VL by learning textual context vectors for CLIP, highlighting prompts as the key adaptation surface across modalities.\nBringing these lines together, the paper proposes training a Prompt-Transformer solely on linguistic data to predict \u201cideal\u201d prompts for a frozen LLM, then using those prompts to align visual features at VL pre-training time. This decoupling retains the frozen-LM design of Flamingo/BLIP-2/LLaVA, but replaces data-hungry multimodal alignment with a text-only prompt learning stage inspired by parameter-efficient prompting in NLP. The result is improved performance over BLIP-2 and a markedly reduced dependence on massive image\u2013text corpora, demonstrating that language-side prompt learning can bootstrap vision-language training.",
