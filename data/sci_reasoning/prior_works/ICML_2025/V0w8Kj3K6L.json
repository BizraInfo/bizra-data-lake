  "synthesis_narrative": "The suitability filter builds on a clear lineage that connects distribution shift detection, output-based error indicators, and formal risk guarantees. Early groundwork by Sugiyama et al. formulated estimating target risk from unlabeled data under covariate shift, establishing the central goal of evaluating performance without labels. Hendrycks and Gimpel showed that simple statistics of model outputs (e.g., confidence) are predictive of errors and OOD inputs, seeding the idea of using output-derived signals. However, Guo et al. revealed that raw probabilities are often miscalibrated, cautioning against naively equating confidence with accuracy and motivating more robust, distributional use of multiple signals. In parallel, Lopez-Paz and Oquab\u2019s classifier two-sample tests and Rabanser et al.\u2019s comprehensive study of shift detection clarified how to compare distributions in practice\u2014and, crucially, exposed a gap: detecting shift alone does not tell us whether accuracy has degraded by an unacceptable amount. The suitability filter directly addresses this gap by transforming output-derived signals into a hypothesis test that certifies whether the accuracy drop exceeds a user-specified margin. Finally, Bates et al. inspired the method\u2019s risk-control framing, aligning the test with finite-sample guarantees on failure rates, while Lipton et al.\u2019s BBSE provides a natural baseline focused on label shift that the new framework generalizes beyond. Together, these works directly enable the paper\u2019s core innovation: guaranteed, label-free assessment of deployment suitability via distributional testing of output signals.",
