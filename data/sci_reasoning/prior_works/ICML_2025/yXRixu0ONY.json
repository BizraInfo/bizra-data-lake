  "synthesis_narrative": "Pallatom\u2019s central advance is to model the joint distribution over protein sequence and structure directly at all\u2011atom resolution. Two architectural pillars trace directly to AlphaFold and RoseTTAFold: AlphaFold\u2019s atom14 representation and recycling loop are reinterpreted for generative decoding, allowing Pallatom to sample physically consistent side chains and manage symmetric or missing atoms; RoseTTAFold\u2019s multi\u2011track mixing inspires Pallatom\u2019s dual\u2011track (token/atom) design with traversing updates that tightly couple residue\u2011level and atomic\u2011level states. Recent generative baselines motivated the shift to true joint all\u2011atom modeling. Chroma demonstrated joint sequence\u2013structure generation but relied on coarser side\u2011chain handling; Pallatom explicitly targets P(all\u2011atom) to improve fidelity. Diffusion backbones such as RFdiffusion and Trippe et al. showcased powerful structure generation yet exposed a key gap: sequence is added post hoc (often via ProteinMPNN), breaking the interdependence between sequence and structure. Pallatom addresses this limitation head\u2011on by unifying sequence and all\u2011atom structure within a single model and decoding process, eliminating the need for a two\u2011stage pipeline. Collectively, these works form a clear lineage: AlphaFold/RoseTTAFold provide the representational and iterative-update blueprint; Chroma frames the co\u2011design objective; diffusion backbones plus ProteinMPNN expose the shortcomings of decoupled generation that Pallatom resolves.",
