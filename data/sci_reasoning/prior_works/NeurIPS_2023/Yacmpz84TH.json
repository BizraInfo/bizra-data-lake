  "synthesis_narrative": "Toolformer\u2019s key contribution is to let a language model teach itself to use external tools by generating its own training signals from a few seed demonstrations, learning when to call which API, with what arguments, and how to incorporate results into subsequent token prediction. This builds on two major threads. First, prior work established the value of tool use but relied on prompting or heavy supervision: ReAct interleaves reasoning and actions via prompts, PAL delegates computation to a Python interpreter, and WebGPT equips an LM with a browser using imitation learning and RLHF. Self-Ask similarly prompts models to issue explicit follow-up queries and perform search mid-solution. These works showed that tools markedly improve arithmetic, factuality, and compositional reasoning, yet they depend on handcrafted prompting or expensive human feedback. Second, retrieval-augmented modeling demonstrated how external information can be integrated during generation: REALM learns to retrieve evidence in pretraining, and RETRO conditions on retrieved neighbors at scale, validating the architectural pattern of mixing external context with LM tokens. The missing piece was scalable supervision for tool-use policies. Self-Instruct provided that methodological blueprint\u2014using an LM to synthesize instruction-tuning data from a small seed. Toolformer unifies these strands by self-generating API-call annotations and training the LM end-to-end to trigger, parameterize, and consume tool outputs, moving tool use from brittle prompting or human supervision to a scalable, self-supervised capability.",
