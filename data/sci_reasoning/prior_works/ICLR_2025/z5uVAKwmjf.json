  "synthesis_narrative": "AFLOW\u2019s core contribution\u2014automating the generation and optimization of agentic workflows by searching over code-represented nodes and edges with Monte Carlo Tree Search\u2014sits at the intersection of three lines of prior work. First, agentic paradigms such as ReAct and AutoGen established that complex tasks benefit from multi-step, tool-using or multi-agent workflows that interleave reasoning with actions and observations. AFLOW targets precisely these workflows but removes the remaining human-in-the-loop burden by automatically proposing and wiring components.\nSecond, search-based reasoning advances like Tree of Thoughts and Graph of Thoughts showed that exploring alternative reasoning paths as trees or graphs can boost performance when paired with evaluation signals. AFLOW operationalizes this insight for workflow synthesis by instantiating the search over executable code graphs and adopting MCTS to balance exploration and exploitation while accumulating tree-structured experience.\nThird, self-improvement via execution feedback\u2014exemplified by Reflexion\u2014and programmatic pipeline optimization\u2014exemplified by DSPy\u2014demonstrated that LM systems can be treated as programs whose components are tunable with outcome-driven signals. AFLOW unifies these ideas: it treats workflows as code, executes them to gather feedback, and iteratively modifies them guided by search. Voyager further informs AFLOW\u2019s emphasis on code-level representations and iterative refinement under environmental feedback. Together, these works directly motivate AFLOW\u2019s design: represent workflows as code graphs, use execution feedback as supervision, and apply structured search (MCTS) to automatically synthesize and refine effective agentic workflows.",
