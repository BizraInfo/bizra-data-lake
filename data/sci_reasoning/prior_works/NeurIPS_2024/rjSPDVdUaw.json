  "synthesis_narrative": "MooG\u2019s core contribution\u2014decoupling representation structure from the image grid by using off-the-grid, cross-attending tokens that remain bound to scene elements over time\u2014sits at the intersection of three influential threads. First, ViT established the prevailing grid-based tokenization that MooG explicitly rejects, framing the problem. Second, transformer query paradigms from DETR and Deformable DETR demonstrated that content-agnostic queries with cross-attention can bind to objects and refine their positions via off-grid reference points; MooG generalizes this idea from supervised detection to self-supervised video, letting latent tokens track entities as they move. Third, Perceiver/Perceiver IO showed how a latent array can be structurally independent from the input and interact through cross-attention, a blueprint MooG adapts to videos with positional signals that guide token motion.\nObject-centric learning with MONet and Slot Attention contributed the mechanism and inductive bias for forming discrete, competition-based slots that bind to entities without labels. MooG preserves this object-centricity but makes it dynamic and scene-grounded in videos through off-grid token motion. Finally, the choice of next-frame prediction is grounded in classic video prediction work (Finn et al.), ensuring the learned latents encode consistent dynamics. Together, these works directly inform MooG\u2019s design: a cross-attentive, latent-token architecture that is independent from the image grid yet grounded in scene structure, trained via self-supervised future prediction to yield tokens that persistently track entities through time.",
