  "synthesis_narrative": "SPLIT sits at the intersection of two traditions: fast but myopic greedy trees and globally optimal yet costly discrete optimization for trees. CART created the dominant greedy, top\u2011down formulation and exposed its suboptimality, setting the stage for optimal formulations such as Optimal Classification Trees (OCT), which showed that exact global optimization can markedly improve accuracy and sparsity but at prohibitive computational cost. Subsequent MILP approaches, notably BinOCT, reinforced both the benefits of exact trees and the scalability barrier that arises from solving every subtree to optimality.\n\nThe breakthrough toward scalable exactness came from branch\u2011and\u2011bound with dynamic programming over subproblems. DL8.5 introduced subproblem caching and tight bounds to reuse computations across overlapping subtrees, while GOSDT advanced an L0\u2011regularized objective and a highly engineered B&B/DP solver that produced certifiably optimal sparse trees. However, these methods still attempt to optimally resolve an exponential number of deep subproblems, which is the core scalability bottleneck.\n\nSPLIT\u2019s key innovation is to explicitly break that bottleneck: using sparse lookahead to prioritize where optimal search matters and switching to greediness near the leaves, it avoids solving deep subproblems to optimality while preserving near\u2011optimal quality. This idea directly extends the B&B/DP infrastructure of DL8.5 and GOSDT, and is inspired by certifiable discrete\u2011optimization design principles from CORELS. The result is a method that effectively marries the accuracy of optimal trees with the speed of greedy induction.",
