  "synthesis_narrative": "The core contribution of Differentiable Task Graph Learning is to formulate task graphs\u2014partial orders over key-steps\u2014as a differentiable, trainable object whose edges are optimized by maximum likelihood and integrated into neural architectures for procedural understanding and online mistake detection. This builds on two lines of prior work. First, instructional-video research established the importance of explicit procedural structure: Alayrac et al. (2016) introduced discovering and aligning step sequences from narrated demonstrations, while CrossTask (2019) crystallized the notion of task graphs as human-interpretable partial orders supervising step recognition and transfer. These works motivated using graphs to capture valid step progressions, but typically relied on hand-crafted or heuristic procedures to obtain the graphs.\nSecond, differentiable graph structure learning provided the tools to move from heuristics to trainable graphs. NOTEARS (2018) showed DAG structures can be learned via continuous acyclicity constraints and gradient-based optimization, and Franceschi et al. (2019) demonstrated end-to-end learning of adjacency matrices for GNNs. The Gumbel-Softmax relaxation (2017) enabled backpropagation through discrete edge selections, a common mechanism in differentiable graph induction. Together, these advances suggest parameterizing edges and optimizing them directly from data\u2014precisely the jump this paper makes by maximizing the likelihood of observed action sequences under a task-graph model. Large-scale procedural datasets like COIN further highlighted the need for scalable, interpretable structure, while the proposed differentiable graphs naturally support downstream uses such as feature-based graph prediction and online mistake detection in egocentric videos.",
