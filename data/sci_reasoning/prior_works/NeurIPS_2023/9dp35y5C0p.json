  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core idea\u2014recasting discrete feature-transformation search as continuous optimization over an embedded sequence space\u2014sits at the intersection of automatic feature construction, program/expression synthesis, and differentiable search. Early symbolic feature construction via genetic programming and automatic relational feature composition (Deep Feature Synthesis) established the utility and difficulty of exploring vast operator-composition spaces, motivating alternatives to exhaustive or heuristic search. Reinforcement learning for architecture discovery (NAS) demonstrated how a policy can guide exploration in large discrete design spaces; this directly informs the paper\u2019s reinforcement-enhanced data preparation, where RL curates high-quality transformation\u2013accuracy pairs to train an autoregressive model.\n\nCrucially, DARTS provides the conceptual blueprint for turning discrete combinatorial design into a differentiable problem, enabling gradient signals to steer search. Technically, sequence VAEs for text show how to embed discrete sequences into a continuous latent space and decode back\u2014precisely the embedding\u2013optimization\u2013reconstruction cycle used here for postfix operator sequences. Finally, symbolic regression advances (DSR and AI Feynman) frame feature transformations as tokenized mathematical expressions and supply operator vocabularies, training signals, and evaluation protocols. The present work synthesizes these strands: it learns autoregressive embeddings over expression tokens, uses RL to improve the supervision set, performs gradient-based search in latent space, and decodes to valid postfix expressions\u2014achieving stable, efficient exploration without sacrificing robustness.",
