  "synthesis_narrative": "DuQuant\u2019s core contribution\u2014dual transformations that redistribute activation outliers via targeted rotations and block-balancing permutations\u2014directly grows from the LLM quantization literature on identifying and mitigating outlier channels and from classical quantization preconditioning. LLM.int8() established that activation outliers are concentrated in a few identifiable dimensions and that handling them specially dramatically improves low-bit inference; DuQuant explicitly uses those outlier indices as priors to construct rotations that diffuse their mass. SmoothQuant demonstrated that channel-wise rescaling can migrate and smooth normal outliers, enabling low-bit activations, but struggles with extremely large magnitudes; DuQuant complements this by employing orthogonal rotations to tame massive outliers that resist simple scaling. AWQ emphasized activation-aware, channel-level sensitivity and group-wise decisions; DuQuant operationalizes this sensitivity by actively re-distributing high-magnitude channels both within blocks (rotations) and across blocks (permutation) to equalize variance. GPTQ\u2019s block/group quantization is a standard backbone but is vulnerable when outliers cluster within groups; DuQuant\u2019s zigzag permutation explicitly spreads outlier channels to stabilize group-wise statistics. Finally, the notion that pre-quantization orthogonal transforms can minimize distortion traces to Optimized Product Quantization, while Outlier Channel Splitting provides a conceptual precedent for redistributing a single channel\u2019s extreme magnitude\u2014an effect DuQuant attains implicitly via rotation without modifying network topology. Together, these works motivate and enable DuQuant\u2019s rotation-plus-permutation strategy to robustly handle both normal and massive outliers in low-bit LLMs.",
