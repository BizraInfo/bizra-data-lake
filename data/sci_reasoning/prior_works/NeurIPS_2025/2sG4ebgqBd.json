  "synthesis_narrative": "SpecMER\u2019s central idea\u2014accelerating protein autoregressive generation via speculative decoding while preserving biological plausibility\u2014sits at the intersection of fast decoding and evolution-informed scoring. The draft-and-verify engine is rooted in speculative decoding (Leviathan et al., 2023), which established how a lightweight proposer can be paired with a target model to achieve speedups without changing the target distribution. In protein design, autoregressive transformers like ProGen (Madani et al., 2023) and large-scale protein LMs (Rives et al., 2021) demonstrated that such models encode rich structural/functional priors, creating a premium on acceleration methods that do not distort their likelihoods.\n\nSpecMER\u2019s biological guidance traces directly to decades of alignment-derived priors. PSI-BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997) and HMMER3 (Eddy, 2011) formalized efficient scoring of sequences against MSA-derived position-specific models, operationalizing evolutionary constraints for fast plausibility assessment. MSA Transformer (Rao et al., 2021) further underscored that MSAs capture co-evolutionary structure pivotal for maintaining function. SpecMER internalizes these insights by extracting k-mer/motif signals from MSAs and using them to score speculative candidates in parallel, selecting drafts consistent with evolutionary patterns.\n\nFinally, the notion that decoding can be steered without retraining is grounded in constrained decoding work (Hokamp & Liu, 2017), which showed constraints can guide token selection. SpecMER adapts this to the protein domain: motif-informed k-mer constraints bias proposals toward biologically viable regions while the target LM verifies them, marrying speed with fidelity to the model\u2019s distribution and to evolutionary priors.",
