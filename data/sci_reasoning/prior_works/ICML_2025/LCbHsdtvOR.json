  "synthesis_narrative": "Expected Variational Inequalities (EVIs) are positioned at the intersection of the classical VI program and the game-theoretic view of distributional solution concepts. Facchinei and Pang\u2019s monograph established VIs as a unifying framework for Nash, complementarity, and generalized equilibrium models, while also exposing the computational brittleness of nonmonotone operators. EVI\u2019s central idea\u2014satisfying VI constraints in expectation under a distribution\u2014draws directly from Aumann\u2019s correlated equilibrium, which recasts best-response stability as a family of linear deviation inequalities over distributions. The algorithmic tractability of EVIs leverages the approachability/no-regret toolkit pioneered by Blackwell and operationalized by Hart and Mas-Colell, where iterative procedures construct distributions that drive vector-valued regrets below zero. Complementing this learning view, Papadimitriou and Roughgarden\u2019s result that correlated equilibria are computable in polynomial time via LP/separation informs EVI\u2019s design: represent deviation-style inequalities compactly and solve them efficiently, even when the underlying operator is nonmonotone. EVI also synthesizes smoothness ideas (Roughgarden), which reason about performance guarantees through deviation inequalities that hold in expectation over randomized outcomes; by elevating these to operator-level constraints, EVIs unify and extend such results beyond games to broader VI instances. Finally, the GNEP literature (Facchinei\u2013Kanzow) ties many coupled-constraint and nonconcave utility models to VIs, clarifying EVI\u2019s extended reach: the same expectation-based relaxation that yields correlated equilibria now offers a polynomial-time pathway for a wider array of VI-modeled systems.",
