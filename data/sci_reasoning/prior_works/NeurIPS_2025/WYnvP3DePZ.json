  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014a unifying k_phi\u2013k_rho\u2013m framework for link representation expressiveness and a principled hierarchy across link GNNs\u2014builds on two pillars: message-passing formalism and WL/theory-driven expressiveness. Gilmer et al.\u2019s message passing provides the primitive maps (phi for messages, rho for aggregation) that the authors reparameterize for link-centric computations, enabling a common language across diverse link models. The expressiveness lens is inherited from WL theory: Xu et al. establish the 1-WL equivalence for node/graph representations, while Morris et al. show how higher-order WL increases distinguishing power. These ideas are adapted to links, where the paper formalizes when two candidate links are indistinguishable and organizes existing methods into a hierarchy. Maron et al.\u2019s invariant/equivariant perspective further grounds the formal tools for reasoning about symmetry, directly inspiring the paper\u2019s graph symmetry metric that quantifies link indistinguishability in practice.\nOn the modeling side, the framework concretely subsumes leading link predictors: SEAL\u2019s enclosing-subgraph approach and GraIL\u2019s inductive subgraph reasoning become specific k_phi\u2013k_rho\u2013m instantiations, clarifying why and when they are more expressive than simple neighborhood-pooling baselines. R-GCN anchors the multi-relational case, showing how relation-specific message maps alter the hierarchy. These works collectively motivate the paper\u2019s synthetic evaluation protocol tailored to link-level expressiveness, and the symmetry metric connects theory to practice by predicting when greater expressiveness yields tangible performance gains on real graphs.",
