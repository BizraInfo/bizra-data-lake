  "synthesis_narrative": "T-REGS sits at the intersection of self-supervised representation learning and geometric probability. On the SSL side, Wang and Isola\u2019s alignment\u2013uniformity framework crystallized the objective of spreading representations uniformly on the hypersphere while aligning augmented views, motivating regularizers that explicitly counteract concentration. Methods such as Barlow Twins and VICReg translated this into anti-collapse mechanisms\u2014redundancy reduction, variance and covariance penalties\u2014that keep representations from degenerating into low-dimensional subspaces. Whitening-based SSL further pursued isotropy, directly shaping the embedding distribution toward uniformity.\nOn the geometric side, classic results on minimal spanning trees\u2014most notably Steele\u2019s asymptotic analysis\u2014established that MST length scales with intrinsic dimension and density, yielding longer trees for more uniform, higher-dimensional point clouds. Costa and Hero extended these ideas with entropic graphs on manifolds, connecting graph-length functionals to entropy and intrinsic dimension in non-Euclidean settings.\nT-REGS fuses these threads: it replaces decorrelation or contrastive energy terms with a single, geometry-driven regularizer\u2014the MST length over learned features. The theoretical guarantees leverage MST scaling laws and entropic-graph insights to show that minimizing a suitable MST-based objective simultaneously mitigates dimensional collapse and promotes uniformity, even on compact Riemannian manifolds. Empirically, this yields a simple, plug-in regularization scheme that improves representation quality across synthetic and standard SSL benchmarks.",
