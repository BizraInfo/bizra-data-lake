  "synthesis_narrative": "TranSDDP\u2019s intellectual lineage begins with SDDP, introduced by Pereira and Pinto, which framed multistage stochastic programs as a sequence of stagewise problems whose value functions are approximated by piecewise-linear convex envelopes built from subgradient cuts. Shapiro\u2019s analysis further cemented the theoretical underpinnings of this cutting-plane approximation within SDDP, delineating the structure TranSDDP preserves. However, classical convergence results such as those by Girardeau, Lecl\u00e8re, and Philpott underscore a practical shortcoming: convergence proofs assume continually expanding banks of cuts, which in practice leads to ballooning time and memory costs as subproblem size and scenario count grow\u2014precisely the gap TranSDDP targets.\n\nThe paper\u2019s core innovation is to replace hand-crafted cut accumulation and heuristics with a learned integration mechanism that composes many subgradient planes into an effective piecewise-linear value approximation. This leap is enabled by the Transformer architecture of Vaswani et al., whose attention mechanism naturally handles variable-length inputs and focuses computation on the most informative signals. Ideas from Deep Sets and the Set Transformer directly inform how to aggregate an unordered (or order-agnostic) collection of cutting planes in a permutation-invariant, attention-based manner, aligning with the need to process a changing pool of cuts at each stage. Rooted in Kelley\u2019s cutting-plane principle yet modernized by attention-based set processing, TranSDDP retains SDDP\u2019s decomposition benefits while directly addressing the cut-proliferation bottleneck through learned, sequential integration of subgradient planes.",
