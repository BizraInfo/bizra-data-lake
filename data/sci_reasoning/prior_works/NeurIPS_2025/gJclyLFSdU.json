  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014formalizing a computationally embedded agent as an automaton simulated within a universal computer, and proving that embeddedness induces implicit constraints and an equivalence to a POMDP-interacting agent\u2014sits at the intersection of embedded agency, universal computation, and bounded rationality. Orseau and Ring\u2019s Space-Time Embedded Intelligence is the most direct antecedent, replacing the traditional Cartesian boundary with an agent that is part of the environment; the present work instantiates this idea concretely and derives formal constraints from it. Hutter\u2019s universal AI framework supplies the universal computation substrate and the agent\u2013environment interface; the authors adapt this setting by embedding the agent in the universal simulator rather than treating it as external. Classic bounded rationality lines\u2014Russell and Subramanian\u2019s bounded-optimal agents and Tishby\u2013Polani\u2019s information-theoretic bounded rationality\u2014motivate the role of limits but rely on explicit resource or information constraints; the new perspective shows such limits arise implicitly from being simulated within the environment, sidestepping ad hoc constraint design. The automaton-based representation draws on the POMDP literature: Meuleau et al.\u2019s finite-state controllers establish automata as policy representations for partially observable environments, and Poupart\u2013Boutilier provide optimization tools for bounded controllers. Finally, Demski and Garrabrant\u2019s Embedded Agency frames the conceptual challenges of embeddedness; this paper advances that agenda by proving equivalence results and constraint properties that ground continual adaptation in a principled, computationally embedded setting.",
