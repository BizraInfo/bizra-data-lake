  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper targets a central impasse in pool-based active learning of halfspaces: with label-only queries, even realizable pools can force \u2126(1/\u03b5) queries to label a finite set, and in noisy or misspecified regimes the situation worsens. Hanneke\u2019s disagreement-based theory and minimax analyses with Yang formalize these barriers and clarify why label-only strategies struggle under noise and misspecification. Balcan, Beygelzimer, and Langford\u2019s agnostic framework further establishes the setting the paper aims to handle: competing with the best hypothesis in a class under imperfect labels.\n\nTo break the 1/\u03b5 barrier, the paper embraces the core insight behind generalized query strategies: well-chosen queries can prune the version space logarithmically. Nowak\u2019s Geometry of Generalized Binary Search provides the halving template and the idea of robustifying noisy answers through aggregation. At the same time, work on simple, structured queries\u2014epitomized by Ashtiani\u2013Kushagra\u2013Ben-David\u2019s same-cluster queries\u2014demonstrates how pairwise equivalence-style questions can deliver O(log(1/\u03b5)) query complexity in realizable settings. However, such queries can be fragile under noise, a vulnerability captured by classic noise models such as Angluin\u2013Laird\u2019s RCN and by agnostic-active-learning limits (Hsu\u2013Langford\u2013Zhang).\n\nBuilding on these threads, the paper designs a noise-robust query language and algorithmic scheme that (i) leverages pairwise/aggregate queries to propagate labels across a fixed pool, (ii) uses GBS-style halving and majority aggregation to counter RCN, and (iii) maintains logarithmic dependence on 1/\u03b5 under misspecification, thereby extending realizable-case query savings to noisy halfspace learning.",
