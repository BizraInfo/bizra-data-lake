  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014selective omniprediction with fair abstention\u2014sits at the intersection of classic reject-option classification and modern omniprediction/multigroup fairness. Chow\u2019s original reject-option model formalized abstention as incurring a fixed cost and characterized the optimal decision rule; subsequent theory by Bartlett and Wegkamp, and the agnostic selective-classification program of El-Yaniv and Wiener, developed surrogate losses, optimality conditions, and risk\u2013coverage trade-offs for abstaining classifiers. Cortes, DeSalvo, and Mohri then provided algorithmic and generalization tools for confidence-rated prediction and abstention, establishing practical learning procedures within this formalism.\n\nOn the fairness and decision-making side, multicalibration and multiaccuracy introduced scalable ways to produce predictors that are simultaneously well-behaved across many subgroups. The omniprediction framework crystallized how a single (multi)calibrated score function can be post-processed to yield loss-optimal decisions for an entire family of objectives. Building directly on this insight, the present paper extends omniprediction to the selective setting: from one calibrated/multiaccurate predictor, a fixed, efficient post-processing yields, for each target loss, the optimal blend of predictions and abstentions under a fixed abstain cost. Finally, by coupling multicalibration/multiaccuracy with this selective post-processing, the authors transport multigroup fairness guarantees into the abstention regime, thereby generalizing prior selective-classification algorithms and fairness methods into a unified, loss-agnostic and group-aware framework.",
