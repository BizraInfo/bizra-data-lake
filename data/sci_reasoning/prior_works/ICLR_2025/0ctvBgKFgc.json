  "synthesis_narrative": "ProtComposer\u2019s core innovation\u2014controllable, compositional protein structure generation from a set of 3D, semantically labeled ellipsoids\u2014sits at the intersection of protein diffusion modeling and layout-driven compositional generation. On the protein side, ProteinSGM established score/diffusion modeling for protein backbones, and RFdiffusion showed high-quality de novo design under structural constraints, but both provided limited, direct control over coarse-grained spatial layouts. Chroma advanced unconditional/diversity-oriented design yet similarly lacked explicit, user-controllable spatial semantics, a gap ProtComposer targets by conditioning on abstract shape primitives. The conceptual blueprint for specifying protein topology originates from Koga et al., who formalized the practice of defining secondary-structure elements (SSEs) and their spatial arrangement as a design recipe; ProtComposer effectively learns to instantiate such blueprints, replacing manual, physics-based assembly with a learned diffusion process guided by parametric 3D ellipsoids that encode SSE identity, location, orientation, and size. From the generative modeling side, layout-conditioned diffusion in computer vision\u2014exemplified by GLIGEN\u2014and composable multi-condition control from Composer directly inform ProtComposer\u2019s treatment of each ellipsoid as a composable conditioning token. By marrying blueprint-style SSE layout specification with compositional diffusion conditioning, ProtComposer unlocks practical control (hand-specified, extracted, or sampled ellipsoid sets) and improves Pareto trade-offs among designability, novelty, and diversity, including matching real-protein helix fractions\u2014capabilities not realized by prior protein generative models.",
