  "synthesis_narrative": "Sundial\u2019s core innovation\u2014TimeFlow Loss for native, distributional pretraining of Transformers on continuous-valued time series\u2014traces directly to the flow-based generative modeling lineage. Flow Matching for Generative Modeling (Lipman et al.) provides the fundamental training principle of matching a target vector field, which Sundial adapts conditionally to predict next-patch distributions. Building on this, Rectified Flow (Liu et al.) demonstrates that properly designed flow fields can mitigate mode collapse and enable fast sampling, informing Sundial\u2019s emphasis on stability and multi-modality. At a deeper level, FFJORD (Grathwohl et al.) established the ODE/CNF perspective\u2014learning continuous vector fields over data\u2014that legitimizes Sundial\u2019s native continuous modeling without discretization.\nOn the time-series side, prior probabilistic forecasters like DeepAR (Salinas et al.) rely on parametric likelihoods that often under-represent multi-modality, a limitation Sundial circumvents by directly learning the next-patch distribution via flows. Diffusion-based forecasting (Rasul et al.) introduced nonparametric, sample-based uncertainty but at the cost of slow sampling; Sundial addresses this by swapping diffusion for flow matching to retain multi-modality with efficiency. Finally, patch-based Transformers for time series (PatchTST) provide the architectural scaffold that Sundial minimally adapts, while tokenization-driven foundation models such as Chronos highlight the tradeoffs of discretization that Sundial explicitly avoids. Together, these works directly shape Sundial\u2019s formulation: patch-conditioned, flow-matched pretraining that scales, remains native to continuous data, and yields diverse, high-quality predictions.",
