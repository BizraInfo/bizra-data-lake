  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014disentangling scene-graph information into layouts and semantics via a stochastic SL-VAE and recomposing them with a diffusion model using Compositional Masked Attention\u2014builds on two converging lines of work. First, sg2im and subsequent scene-graph-driven GANs revealed the value of structured relational input and intermediate layouts for complex scenes, but were largely deterministic and struggled with diversity and fidelity. SPADE further showed that conditioning on semantic layouts while sampling appearance codes can yield diverse, layout-faithful images, motivating an explicit separation of spatial structure from appearance. The proposed SL-VAE extends this idea to scene graphs, jointly inferring a distribution over (layout, semantic) factors to enable one-to-many, relationally consistent sampling.\nSecond, modern diffusion methods provide the synthesis fidelity and control mechanisms required to compose many objects. Latent Diffusion established cross-attention as a powerful conditioning interface, while Prompt-to-Prompt demonstrated direct attention-map control for precise, localized edits. ControlNet highlighted how structured external signals can guide diffusion without destabilizing the base model, and GLIGEN operationalized region-level grounding with boxes. Building on these, the paper\u2019s Compositional Masked Attention injects scene-graph-derived layouts and semantic embeddings as object-wise masks and features, enabling fine-grained, relation-aware composition. Together, these prior works directly inform the paper\u2019s key innovation: a generalizable, stochastic graph-to-(layout, semantics)-to-diffusion pipeline that faithfully renders complex, multi-object scenes with controllable diversity.",
