  "synthesis_narrative": "This paper addresses a long-standing gap in the theory of convex message passing for MAP inference: whether the iterates of practical, LP-based methods such as TRW-S and max-sum diffusion converge to a fixed point, and at what rate. The intellectual lineage begins with the tree-reweighted framework of Wainwright, Jaakkola, and Willsky, which established convex upper bounds and a dual LP/Lagrangian relaxation viewpoint for MAP. Kolmogorov\u2019s TRW-S operationalized this with a highly effective block-coordinate descent style schedule, proving monotone dual improvement and convergence to a set characterized by local consistency of active constraints, but leaving open iterate convergence. Parallel developments\u2014MPLP by Sontag, Globerson, and Jaakkola, dual decomposition by Komodakis et al., and Globerson\u2013Jaakkola\u2019s convergent redesigns\u2014cemented the perspective that message updates are block optimizations over a polyhedral dual objective.\n\nThe present work advances this line by importing and sharpening tools from coordinate-descent theory. Tseng\u2019s general convergence results for nondifferentiable convex functions provide the methodological backbone; Ravikumar et al. further clarified the LP/convex optimization structure of message passing objectives. Building on these, the authors analyze a coordinate-descent variant for piecewise-affine convex objectives, proving that iterates converge to a fixed point and that termination occurs within O(1/\u03b5) iterations. They then instantiate these results for several convex message passing algorithms (including TRW-S and max-sum diffusion), thereby upgrading prior objective-convergence and local-consistency guarantees to full fixed-point convergence with a concrete iteration complexity.",
