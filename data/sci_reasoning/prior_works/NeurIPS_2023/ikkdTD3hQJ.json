  "synthesis_narrative": "AIMS\u2019s core contribution\u2014a unified, all-inclusive segmentation framework that concurrently predicts part-, entity-, and relation-level regions across heterogeneous datasets\u2014emerges from the convergence of three research threads. First, the entity-level foundation is inherited from panoptic segmentation, which formalized a mask-based view of visual entities. Building on this, universal mask-classification transformers like Mask2Former demonstrated that a single mask-query architecture can flexibly support semantic, instance, and panoptic tasks; AIMS extends this paradigm to additional granularity (parts) and to pairwise relational outputs. Complementing this, OneFormer showed that task prompting can steer a single transformer across segmentation variants, a principle AIMS adopts and adapts through its task complementarity and association mechanisms to couple predictions across levels.\nSecond, AIMS\u2019s prompt mask encoder is informed by the promptable design of Segment Anything, reusing the notion that masks (and other signals) can serve as conditioning inputs to guide segmentation. AIMS repurposes this to propagate information across levels (e.g., using entity masks to refine part or relation predictions), aiding generalization in multi-dataset training.\nThird, to incorporate relationships and tackle cross-dataset inconsistencies, AIMS leverages the PSG formulation of segmentation-grounded relations for its relation-level targets and draws from Graphonomy\u2019s strategy of reconciling disparate label spaces in part segmentation. Together, these works directly motivate AIMS\u2019s unified architecture, its prompt-based cross-level conditioning, and its multi-dataset learning strategy that addresses annotation inconsistency while exploiting task correlations.",
