  "synthesis_narrative": "The core of this paper fuses the identifiability mechanisms of linear non-Gaussian SEMs with the modern theory of adaptive experiment design. The LiNGAM formulation (Shimizu et al., 2006) established that ICA recovers the mixing matrix only up to scaling and permutation. Lacerda et al. (2008) carried this to cyclic models, making explicit that in the presence of instantaneous feedback, observational data pin down structure only up to a permutation ambiguity. Our work takes the next step by recasting that permutation ambiguity as a combinatorial object: a perfect matching between error components and variables, which yields a tractable representation of the permutation-equivalence class.\n\nOn the experimental design side, Eberhardt et al. (2005) and Hauser and B\u00fchlmann (2014) framed interventions as actions that eliminate incompatible causal graphs within an equivalence class, formulating optimization problems over such eliminations. Kocaoglu et al. (2017) then demonstrated that elimination-type rewards for orienting DAGs exhibit (adaptive) submodularity, enabling provably near-optimal greedy policies under budget constraints; Ghassami et al. (2018) operationalized closely related greedy designs for budgeted structure learning. Building directly on these ideas, we define a natural elimination reward over the permutation-equivalence classes induced by cyclic LiNG models and prove adaptive submodularity using the framework of Golovin and Krause (2011). This yields a near-optimal greedy strategy in our new matching-based state space, while each atomic intervention reveals one edge of the true matching and prunes incompatible structures. Together, these works directly shaped our matching characterization and the adaptive greedy design with guarantees.",
