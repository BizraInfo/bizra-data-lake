  "synthesis_narrative": "Lewis-weight sampling established that \u2113p regression objectives can be preserved by selecting high-sensitivity rows, giving provable subspace embeddings and sample complexity guarantees tailored to p. Spectral sparsification in dynamic streams showed that one can maintain near-linear-size summaries of a graph that preserve quadratic energies b^T L^+ b, yielding accurate electrical-flow costs in small space even under adversarial edge updates. The semi-streaming resparsify-on-arrival technique refined this approach, repeatedly compressing edges based on leverage-like scores to keep sketches tiny while preserving energy. Sketch-and-solve regression in input-sparsity time demonstrated powerful one-pass linear-algebraic sketches, but crucially for overdetermined, row-arrival settings, leaving the dual, column-arrival regime unaddressed. Basis pursuit introduced the canonical \u21131 minimization under linear constraints, anchoring the \u2113p family\u2019s underdetermined formulation. Electrical-flow methods connected \u21132 energies with flow optimization and even max-flow approximations, highlighting \u2113p norms as a common language for flows. Graph sketching works formalized the edge-insertion model and provided core primitives for maintaining flow-relevant summaries under streaming. Together, these works reveal both a methodological toolkit\u2014sensitivity sampling, resparsification, and spectral sketching\u2014and a gap: no one-pass method for underdetermined, column-arrival \u2113p regression or general \u2113p flows. The current paper synthesizes Lewis-weight style sensitivities in the dual \u2113q space with resparsify-on-arrival ideas to maintain a small, one-pass column/edge summary that provably preserves optimal \u2113p objective values, thereby extending spectral-style guarantees from p=2 to all p and unifying regression and flow estimation in the column-arrival streaming model.",
