  "synthesis_narrative": "LipsNet++ addresses action fluctuation in real-world reinforcement learning by unifying a learnable filter and a Lipschitz-controlled controller inside the policy network. Its controller layer is grounded in the notion that input\u2013output smoothness can be enforced by limiting the network\u2019s sensitivity to input perturbations. Contractive Auto-Encoders established the practical recipe of penalizing the Jacobian norm to induce local contractivity, while subsequent analyses\u2014such as Robust Large Margin Deep Neural Networks\u2014solidified the theoretical link between small Jacobian norms, robustness, and better generalization. Spectral Normalization provided a complementary, operator-norm\u2013based route to controlling Lipschitz constants. Together, these works directly motivate LipsNet++\u2019s Jacobian regularization to explicitly bound the policy\u2019s Lipschitz constant and suppress non-smooth action responses to noisy observations.\n\nOn the perception side, LipsNet++ incorporates a trainable frequency-domain filter that attenuates observation noise before the controller acts. The feasibility and effectiveness of end-to-end differentiable filtering in sequential decision systems is foreshadowed by Deep Kalman Filters, which embed trainable filtering within deep models for noisy time series. The specific choice of a Fourier-domain layer draws on recent advances showing that frequency-space parameterizations are powerful and trainable: Fourier Neural Operators learn multiplicative spectral weights via FFTs to capture pertinent structures, while SincNet demonstrates that learnable band-pass filters can act as task-adaptive, noise-suppressing front-ends. By combining these two lines\u2014differentiable filtering for noisy observations and principled Lipschitz control for smooth policies\u2014LipsNet++ operationalizes the classical filter\u2013controller decomposition within a single, trainable policy network tailored for robust, low-fluctuation control.",
