  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014using human expertise to resolve algorithmically indistinguishable inputs and thereby provably improve prediction\u2014stands at the intersection of decision theory, selective prediction, and human\u2013AI collaboration. Blackwell\u2019s seminal theory of experiments provides the conceptual backbone: if human judgments deliver signals that refine the algorithm\u2019s coarsened view of the world, the combined signal is Blackwell-more-informative and must reduce Bayes risk. Chow\u2019s classical reject-option work motivates selective engagement, but here the selection rule is structural (indistinguishability classes) rather than confidence-threshold-based, clarifying when deferral is beneficial.\nLearning-to-defer studies operationalize machine-to-human handoff. Madras et al. introduce objectives that allow a model to defer to an expert, while Mozannar and Sontag identify consistency and identifiability challenges when labels are selectively observed. The present framework addresses these issues by testing whether experts truly possess side information beyond training data and by targeting deferral precisely where the algorithm cannot discriminate.\nTechnically, the indistinguishability lens resonates with Kearns\u2019s statistical query paradigm: algorithms constrained by data access or hypothesis class render many inputs indistinguishable. Human expertise can inject non-SQ information to separate such cases. Finally, large-scale evidence from Kleinberg et al. demonstrates that humans often hold context not captured in features; this paper turns that observation into a principled mechanism and performance bound, specifying when and how human judgments should be integrated to reliably outperform any standalone feasible predictor.",
