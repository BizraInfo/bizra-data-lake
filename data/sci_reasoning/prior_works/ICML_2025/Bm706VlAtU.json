  "synthesis_narrative": "This paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014frequency-aware diffusion-based adversarial purification\u2014emerges from two converging threads: diffusion purification and frequency-domain understanding of images and robustness. On the generative side, DDPM establishes a forward isotropic Gaussian noising and reverse denoising framework, while score-based SDEs generalize the reverse-time denoising machinery used in practice. SDEdit reframes noising\u2013denoising as structure-preserving editing, a perspective later adopted by diffusion-based defenses such as DiffPure, which \u201cdrown\u201d adversarial perturbations in noise and then denoise. However, DiffPure (and the DDPM forward process it inherits) treats all pixels\u2014and thus all frequencies\u2014equally, often eroding semantic content. On the frequency side, Yin et al. show that robustness is frequency dependent, motivating a defense that reasons explicitly in the Fourier domain. Classical signal processing (Oppenheim & Lim) and modern computer vision (FDA by Yang & Soatto) further decompose images into amplitude and phase, with phase carrying structure and low-frequency amplitude controlling global content/style. Building on these insights, the present work analyzes diffusion purification through the Fourier lens, finding adversarial damage rises monotonically with frequency for both amplitude and phase. It then redesigns purification to preferentially preserve low-damage frequency components, extracting content and structure while removing high-frequency adversarial artifacts\u2014directly remedying the indiscriminate damage inherent to prior diffusion-based purification.",
