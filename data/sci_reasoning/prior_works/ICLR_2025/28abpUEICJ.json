  "synthesis_narrative": "Semedo and colleagues showed that inter-areal communication is constrained to a low-dimensional subspace, evidencing that cross-regional coupling can be captured parsimoniously by a few interaction modes. LFADS established that latent dynamical systems can recover single-trial population dynamics but did so with opaque latent factors and typically per-session training. AutoLFADS pooled across sessions to scale LFADS, yet it did not impose interpretable structure for cross-area coupling nor address non-simultaneous recordings without alignment. Gallego and collaborators demonstrated that latent manifolds can remain stable across days, but depended on explicit alignment procedures to stitch sessions, implying a need for generative models that naturally integrate asynchronous, non-identical recordings. PSID framed interpretable linear state-space identification under partial observation, separating behaviorally relevant dynamics, highlighting how principled system identification can recover structured latent dynamics without deep black boxes. The Shared Response Model introduced a multi-view shared-latent formulation with subject-specific loadings, offering a template for learning shared latent structure without voxel/neuron identity. Bayesian Group Factor Analysis provided group-sparse loadings across views, a mechanism to assign interpretable, view-specific participation in shared factors. Together, these works suggested that cross-area interactions are low dimensional and sparse, that multi-session integration should avoid brittle alignment, and that multi-view generative factorization can share structure while allowing view-specific variability. Building on these insights, the natural next step is to learn a unified, interpretable dynamical model where global sub-circuit bases mediate cross-regional ensemble interactions and accommodate asynchronous, non-simultaneous recordings via shared interaction structure with sparse, ensemble-level loadings.",

    "abstract": "Modern recordings of neural activity provide diverse observations of neurons across brain areas, behavioral conditions, and subjects; presenting an exciting opportunity to reveal the fundamentals of brain-wide dynamics. Current analysis methods, however, often fail to fully harness the richness of such data, as they provide either uninterpretable representations (e.g., via deep networks) or oversimplify models (e.g., by assuming stationary dynamics or analyzing each session independently). Here, instead of regarding asynchronous neural recordings that lack alignment in neural identity or brain areas as a limitation, we leverage these diverse views into the brain to learn a unified model of neural dynamics. Specifically, we assume that brain activity is driven by multiple hidden global sub-circuits. These sub-circuits represent global basis interactions between neural ensembles\u2014functional groups of neurons\u2014such that the time-varying decomposition of these sub-circuits defines how the en",
