  "synthesis_narrative": "Mind-the-Glitch sits at the intersection of diffusion backbones, personalization, correspondence, and contrastive learning. Latent Diffusion Models established that pre-trained diffusion U-Nets encode rich internal features supporting high-fidelity synthesis, implicitly blending semantic and visual cues. Subsequent works like Prompt-to-Prompt revealed that diffusion cross-attention maps capture strong semantic alignments suitable for editing, suggesting a semantic bias in these features. In parallel, self-supervised representation learning (DINO) showed that label-free features can induce semantic part correspondences, but did not explicitly separate appearance from semantics, leaving fine-grained visual matching underexplored.\nSubject-driven generation methods such as DreamBooth and Textual Inversion created the dominant use case where visual consistency of a specific subject is both critical and fragile. These works also provide a practical data regime that Mind-the-Glitch leverages to automatically assemble image pairs with controlled semantic sameness and visual variations, enabling supervision for disentanglement without manual annotations. To operationalize this, the paper adopts a SimCLR-style contrastive framework to explicitly pull together visual correspondences while pushing apart purely semantic similarities, yielding decoupled feature streams: one semantic, one visual.\nFinally, evaluation conventions have relied on global perceptual metrics like LPIPS, which conflate semantic and visual factors. By extracting a visual-correspondence signal from diffusion backbones, Mind-the-Glitch proposes the Visual Semantic Matching (VSM) metric, which more sensitively detects subject-level visual inconsistencies. Together, these prior works directly scaffold the paper\u2019s core innovation: disentangling diffusion features to enable reliable visual correspondence and principled assessment of subject-driven generation fidelity.",
