  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of Brauer\u2019s Group Equivariant Neural Networks is an explicit, complete characterization of linear equivariant layers between tensor-power spaces for O(n), SO(n), and Sp(n). Its intellectual lineage tightly couples classical invariant theory with recent machine learning advances on equivariant parameterizations. At the mathematical foundation, Schur (1927) introduced the commutant perspective through Schur\u2013Weyl duality for GL(n), establishing the paradigm of identifying intertwiners via centralizer algebras. Brauer (1937) extended this paradigm to the orthogonal and symplectic groups, proving that their commutants on tensor powers are the Brauer algebras with diagrammatic pairings\u2014precisely the structures this paper turns into a spanning set of learnable linear maps. Weyl\u2019s classical invariant theory further guarantees that permutations and contractions with the invariant bilinear or symplectic form generate all invariants/equivariants, justifying the completeness of the proposed basis.\n\nOn the machine learning side, Maron et al. (2019) demonstrated how to operationalize centralizer algebras for S_n by giving explicit bases (via partition-algebra index patterns) and universality results for permutation symmetries; their limitation to S_n exposed a gap for continuous classical groups. Kondor and Trivedi (2018) supplied the general intertwiners-as-equivariant-layers viewpoint that this work makes concrete for tensor-power representations of O(n), SO(n), and Sp(n). Finally, methods like Tensor Field Networks for SO(3) illustrated practical equivariance but lacked a complete spanning characterization across dimensions and groups\u2014precisely the gap this paper closes by importing Brauer-algebra generators into learnable equivariant layers.",
