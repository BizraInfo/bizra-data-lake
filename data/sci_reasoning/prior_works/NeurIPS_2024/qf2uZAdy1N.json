  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper advances a modular theory of reinforcement learning with rich observations by explicitly separating observation modeling from latent-dynamics learning. Its statistical viewpoint builds on the function-approximation RL framework inaugurated by Jiang and Krishnamurthy\u2019s CDPs and subsequent complexity measures: these works identified structural conditions (e.g., low Bellman rank) under which exploration and estimation are tractable. The authors show that composing such latent-space tractable models with a rich observation channel often destroys tractability, using canonical classes like linear MDPs (Jin\u2013Yang\u2013Wang) as exemplars of what breaks under composition.\n\nTo recover tractability, the paper introduces latent pushforward coverability: a distributional coverage condition that transports the spirit of concentrability (Munos\u2013Szepesv\u00e1ri) and instance-dependent measures like the Decision-Estimation Coefficient (Foster\u2013Krishnamurthy et al.) through the observation map. Algorithmically, it generalizes the separation principle hinted at in rich-observation literature: prior Block MDP and latent-decoding methods (e.g., PCID) demonstrated that one can decode or estimate latent state and then plan/learn in the latent space. This work elevates that idea into a provably efficient observable-to-latent reduction that applies beyond tabular latent dynamics and without strong spectral identifiability assumptions, subsuming earlier spectral POMDP efforts. Together, these threads yield a unifying condition and reduction that clarify when and how rich observations can be modularly composed with general latent dynamics while retaining statistical and algorithmic efficiency.",
