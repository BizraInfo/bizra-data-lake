  "synthesis_narrative": "HDTwins\u2019 key contribution\u2014automatically specifying and optimizing hybrid digital twins that fuse mechanistic models with neural components\u2014sits at the intersection of three lines of work: hybrid differential modeling, physics-informed learning under data scarcity, and automated structure discovery. Universal Differential Equations (Rackauckas et al.) provided the foundational mechanism for embedding trainable neural terms into mechanistic ODE/PDE systems, enabling end-to-end differentiable training of gray-box models. Neural ODEs (Chen et al.) supplied the practical machinery\u2014differentiable solvers and adjoint gradients\u2014to train such continuous-time models efficiently.\n\nTo ensure robustness and extrapolation in data-scarce regimes, HDTwins embraces the physics-regularized supervision pioneered by PINNs (Raissi et al.), enforcing mechanistic consistency as it searches over candidate hybrid designs. Its \u201cautomatic specification\u201d draws inspiration from SINDy (Brunton et al.) and PDE-Net (Long et al.), which showed that structural discovery is feasible by selecting sparse terms or constrained operators; HDTwins extends this idea to a richer search space of mechanistic modules and neural augmentations, optimizing both structure and parameters jointly. Finally, operator-learning approaches like DeepONet (Lu et al.) highlight the importance of generalization across varying conditions, a central desideratum for digital twins that HDTwins tackles via modular mechanistic\u2013neural compositions rather than purely black-box surrogates. The parsimony ethos of symbolic regression (AI Feynman) further informs HDTwins\u2019 bias toward compact, interpretable hybrid structures. Collectively, these works directly scaffold HDTwins\u2019 automated, evolvable, and generalizable hybrid modeling framework.",
