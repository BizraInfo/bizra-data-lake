  "synthesis_narrative": "RIVAL targets the persistent domain gap between real images and purely generative samples when producing image variations. This work stands on two pillars: accurate real-image inversion and attention-based feature reuse. DDIM provides a deterministic trajectory and practical inversion mechanism, allowing RIVAL to explicitly reconstruct an image\u2019s step-wise latent chain. Latent Diffusion Models supply the latent-space backbone and attention modules that RIVAL manipulates. Prior real-image editing methods, notably Null-Text Inversion and SDEdit, demonstrated that faithful editing depends on tracing a realistic diffusion path from the input image; however, they left a distribution mismatch between the real-image inversion path and the forward generative path that can degrade variations. RIVAL\u2019s central insight is to align the generative process to the source inversion chain via step-wise latent distribution normalization, directly addressing this mismatch. In parallel, attention control advances\u2014Prompt-to-Prompt\u2019s cross-attention locking, Plug-and-Play Diffusion\u2019s feature injection, and MasaCtrl\u2019s mutual self-attention sharing\u2014showed that reusing attention features can preserve structure and identity across generations. RIVAL adapts and extends these ideas with cross-image self-attention injection, enabling strong feature interaction between the source and the variation while the per-step distribution alignment maintains consistency with the real-image trajectory. Together, these strands culminate in a pipeline that preserves content and realism, producing higher-quality real-world image variations.",
