  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014using sharpness (local error bounds) to robustly learn a single neuron under adversarial label noise\u2014rests on two intertwined lineages: the optimization theory of error bounds and high-dimensional robust estimation. Foundational works by Luo and Tseng established local error bounds as a principled way to relate residuals to distance from the solution set. Subsequent advances clarified the geometry: Karimi et al. showed how the Polyak\u2013\u0141ojasiewicz condition bounds excess risk by gradient norms, while Drusvyatskiy and Lewis tied error bounds to quadratic growth and linear convergence, and Necoara et al. positioned error-bound conditions as drivers for first-order method guarantees without strong convexity. These results supply the exact sharpness toolkit this paper wields to convert gradient information into certified control of excess L2^2 error for single-neuron losses.\n\nOn the robustness side, Diakonikolas et al.\u2019s iterative filtering demonstrated how to reliably excise adversarial corruptions in high dimensions. The present paper adapts this idea to the nonconvex single-neuron landscape, using sharpness to decide when and how filtering should occur so that the remaining data support near-optimal regression. Finally, prior learning guarantees for one-hidden-layer networks (e.g., Zhong et al.) highlighted strong distributional assumptions and the lack of adversarial-noise robustness; robust linear-regression methods (e.g., Bhatia et al.) offered baselines limited to linear models. The new work unifies these strands\u2014optimization sharpness and robust filtering\u2014to achieve constant-factor approximation to the optimal L2^2 error for broad activations under significantly milder assumptions.",
