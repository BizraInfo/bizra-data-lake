  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014reducing sample complexity by estimating policy differences rather than absolute policy values\u2014stands on three intertwined pillars: difference identities, variance-reduced estimators, and pure-exploration design. At the identity level, Conservative Policy Iteration (Kakade & Langford, 2002) supplies the performance difference lemma that directly expresses value gaps through advantages under occupancy measures, making policy-difference estimation a principled target. On the estimator side, doubly robust policy evaluation in contextual bandits (Dud\u00edk et al., 2011) and its extension to finite-horizon RL (Jiang & Li, 2016) demonstrate that carefully constructed difference-based/control-variate estimators can dramatically lower variance, motivating the paper\u2019s positive contextual bandit result and its \u201calmost suffices\u201d guarantee in RL via occupancy-related quantities.\n\nFrom a pure exploration viewpoint, best-arm identification results (Garivier & Kaufmann, 2016; Soare et al., 2014) show that optimal testing and allocation focus on pairwise gaps rather than estimating all means, directly inspiring the paper\u2019s policy-difference-centric sampling strategies for identifying an \u03b5-optimal policy. In contrast, state-of-the-art tabular RL results with a generative model (Sidford et al., 2018) reach near-optimal sample complexity by estimating values directly, providing the baseline the authors conceptually improve upon for contextual bandits and nearly match for RL. Finally, PAC sample-complexity and lower-bound techniques in episodic RL (Dann & Brunskill, 2015) underpin the paper\u2019s separation result that difference-only estimation is insufficient in tabular RL, while clarifying where the near-sufficiency line lies. Together, these works directly shape the paper\u2019s key contribution: formalizing when and how policy-difference estimation yields tangible sample-complexity gains, and delineating the precise gap between contextual bandits and tabular RL.",
