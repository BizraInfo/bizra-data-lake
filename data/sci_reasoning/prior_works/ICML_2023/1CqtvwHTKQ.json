  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014a conceptual framework that explains when global versus episodic exploration bonuses are effective in environments that vary across episodes\u2014rests on two pillars: the contextual MDP formulation and the modern families of intrinsic motivation methods. Hallak et al. introduced contextual MDPs, formalizing the setting where each episode is drawn from a context-specific MDP. This directly enables the authors\u2019 central lens: quantifying shared structure by examining the variance of the value function across contexts. On the exploration side, Bellemare et al. unified count-based exploration and intrinsic motivation, crystallizing the idea of global novelty bonuses derived from lifelong statistics; this notion underpins global methods like Pathak et al.\u2019s curiosity (prediction error) and Burda et al.\u2019s RND, both of which serve as principal global baselines here. In contrast, Savinov et al.\u2019s episodic curiosity operationalized per-episode novelty via episodic memory, providing the prototypical episodic-bonus mechanism that this study evaluates and interprets. Crucially, Badia et al.\u2019s NGU demonstrated that combining episodic and global bonuses can be powerful, but left open when and why each component helps; this paper directly addresses that gap by disentangling the roles of the bonuses and tying them to cross-episode structure. Finally, RIDE contributes an episodic-style intrinsic reward used in procedurally generated settings, giving a concrete episodic baseline whose behavior across varying shared structure the authors scrutinize. Together, these works directly enable and motivate the unified analysis advanced in this paper.",
