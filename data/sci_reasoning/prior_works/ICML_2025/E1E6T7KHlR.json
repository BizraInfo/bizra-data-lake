  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of Generative Social Choice: The Next Generation is to endow the generative social choice framework with rigorous guarantees under two real-world frictions: only approximately optimal query results from large language models and a global budget on slate length. This builds directly on the original Generative Social Choice baseline, which married approval-based multiwinner objectives with LLM querying to synthesize representative slates from unstructured opinions. The proportional fairness target itself is grounded in approval-based committee voting theory, most notably the justified representation guarantees formalized by Aziz et al., which the generative setting seeks to emulate for statements rather than fixed candidates. The paper\u2019s new budgeted formulation leans on classical submodular maximization under knapsack constraints, with Sviridenko\u2019s results providing the algorithmic and approximation backbone for length-limited slate construction. Because LLM-driven queries inevitably produce approximate or noisy evaluations, the analysis of greedy optimization with inaccurate function values by Horel and Singer supplies the key robustness tools the paper adapts to prove performance despite approximate queries. Finally, Lin and Bilmes\u2019s budgeted submodular approach to text summarization offers a closely related paradigm\u2014selecting representative text under a length budget\u2014that informs how to operationalize proportional representation when the items are variable-length statements rather than fixed-size candidates. Together with the broader motivation of democratic inputs to AI, these works form the direct intellectual lineage of the paper\u2019s theoretical and algorithmic advances.",
