  "synthesis_narrative": "The key contribution of Context-PIPs is to demonstrate that independent point tracking (PIPs/TAP) benefits markedly from explicit spatial context, operationalized through Source Feature Enhancement (SOFE) and Target Feature Aggregation (TAFA). This builds directly on the TAP-Vid formulation, which popularized the track-any-point (TAP/PIPs) task and standardized metrics like ATE and A-PCK. Foundationally, PIPs established the now-dominant independent particle paradigm for point tracking, prioritizing scalability and long-range persistence but largely omitting spatial context. TAPIR advanced this line with iterative refinement and occlusion reasoning, yet it remains predominantly per-point, leaving contextual cues under-exploited.\n\nIn parallel, CoTracker showed that jointly tracking many points via attention confers strong robustness by leveraging spatial context across points\u2014evidence that context is crucial for overcoming drift and occlusions. Context-PIPs imports this insight into the independent regime, proving that context need not require joint optimization; it can be injected via principled feature aggregation at source and target locations.\n\nArchitecturally, RAFT\u2019s all-pairs correlation and iterative updates provide a successful template for correspondence refinement, while SuperGlue and LoFTR demonstrate that context-conditioned matching (via graph attention or transformers) improves reliability in challenging correspondence tasks. Context-PIPs synthesizes these ideas: preserve the efficiency and simplicity of independent tracking (PIPs/TAPIR) but augment it with spatial context (inspired by CoTracker, SuperGlue, LoFTR), yielding significant gains on TAP-Vid/CroHD benchmarks, particularly under occlusion and long-range motion.",
