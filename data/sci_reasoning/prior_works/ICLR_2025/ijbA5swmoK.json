  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014reducing computational complexity in second-order convex\u2013concave min\u2013max optimization by reusing Hessians\u2014rests on three pillars. First, the Monteiro\u2013Svaiter accelerated hybrid proximal/extragradient framework provides the foundational iteration-complexity lens for saddle-point problems and delivers the optimal O(\u03b5^-3/2) rate the authors preserve. Second, the oracle accounting and prevailing computational baseline come from recent second-order analyses of saddle-point methods (Doikov et al., 2023), which formalize FO vs. SO costs (N and dN) and implicitly motivate the question the present work answers: can we beat the O((N + d^2) d \u03b5^-2/3) computational cost without losing optimal iteration complexity? Third, the feasibility of \u2018lazy\u2019 Hessians is grounded in the cubic-regularized Newton framework of Nesterov\u2013Polyak (2006) and its inexact-Hessian variants (Grapiglia\u2013Nesterov, 2017), which show that bounded Hessian errors preserve optimal complexity. The authors translate these inexactness principles to the MS min\u2013max setting and design a refresh schedule that amortizes Hessian computation. The conceptual inspiration traces back to Shamanskii\u2019s method\u2014multiple Newton steps per Jacobian/Hessian\u2014and the Eisenstat\u2013Walker idea of accuracy-controlled inexact Newton steps, which together inform when a stale Hessian remains adequate. By combining the MS acceleration, the Doikov et al. oracle model, and inexact-Hessian cubic regularization, the paper achieves a d^{1/3} improvement in computational complexity via rigorous Hessian-reuse scheduling.",
