  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core idea\u2014training two 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models in parallel with a consistency constraint and complementary masks\u2014builds on three converging threads. First, 3DGS established a high-fidelity, efficient point-based representation and training pipeline for neural rendering, but it remains brittle to in-the-wild artifacts. Second, the in-the-wild NeRF literature, especially NeRF-W, demonstrated that explicitly modeling or masking transient, inconsistent content is crucial for stability outside controlled captures. Asymmetric Dual 3DGS inherits this insight, replacing a single transient head with two complementary masks: a multi-cue adaptive mask grounded in multi-view photometric/geometric evidence and a self-supervised soft mask learned from the rendering signal itself. The multi-cue design echoes classical MVS practice (e.g., pixelwise view selection) where photometric consistency, visibility, and reprojection cues drive outlier rejection.\nThird, the method draws from robust and semi-supervised learning. Consistency regularization (Mean Teacher) shows that aligning predictions across perturbed models stabilizes learning, while co-teaching highlights that two networks can mutually filter unreliable samples and reduce confirmation bias. The proposed asymmetric dual setup uses cross-model consistency to converge on stable geometry, and divergent masking to avoid both models reinforcing the same failure modes. Finally, deep ensembles motivated exploiting stochastic variation across runs: disagreement becomes a proxy for uncertainty, guiding the masking and suppression of artifacts. Together, these strands directly inform a principled, efficient recipe for robust 3DGS training in the wild.",
