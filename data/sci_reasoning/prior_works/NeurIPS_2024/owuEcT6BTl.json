  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014a concept-space framework for tracking how models acquire and manipulate independent concepts, with learning order governed by a measurable \u201cconcept signal\u201d and abrupt trajectory turns marking emergence of hidden capabilities\u2014sits at the confluence of learning-dynamics theory, disentangled representation learning, and concept-level interpretability. Saxe\u2013McClelland\u2013Ganguli provide the key theoretical blueprint: distinct data modes have different time constants set by their singular values, a result this work generalizes into a concept-centric notion of signal that predicts learning speed and order beyond deep linear settings. Rahaman et al.\u2019s spectral bias similarly grounds the intuition that models preferentially fit higher-signal (simpler/low-frequency) structure first; here, that principle is instantiated at the level of concepts in generative models.\nOperationally, TCAV\u2019s concept directions and GAN Dissection\u2019s causal interventions supply the tools and precedent for representing concepts as axes and probing their causal manipulability throughout training. beta-VAE motivates treating independent generative factors as axes in a latent space, aligning with the paper\u2019s assumption that concepts can be decomposed into separable directions.\nFinally, the paper\u2019s discovery of sharp \u201cturns\u201d in concept-space trajectories dovetails with two influential lines of work on abrupt capability emergence: grokking\u2019s phase transitions during training and Anthropic\u2019s superposition models of hidden, interfered features. Together, these works directly shape the paper\u2019s central insight: concept signal drives the tempo and ordering of concept learning, and intervention-detectable capability emergence coincides with representation reorganization that resolves superposition.",
