  "synthesis_narrative": "QueryDiff\u2019s core idea\u2014teaching a segmentation model to internalize scene-level semantic distributions via agent queries with diffusion guidance\u2014emerges at the intersection of query-based segmentation, object-centric aggregation, and diffusion-as-teacher. DETR inaugurated the notion of learned queries that attend to features to summarize instances, establishing a foundation for set-based, permutation-invariant prediction. Mask2Former advanced this paradigm for dense prediction, demonstrating that query-driven mask decoding effectively aggregates global scene context. Building on these, QueryDiff introduces agent queries crafted from segmentation features to explicitly summarize per-scene semantic structure, drawing conceptual inspiration from Slot Attention\u2019s object-centric \u2018slots\u2019 that iteratively parse scenes into coherent entities.\n\nOn the robustness side, DGSS has leaned heavily on appearance manipulations such as MixStyle or FDA, which randomize or transfer style statistics but often erode task-relevant semantics. Instance-Selective Whitening likewise suppresses domain correlations at the risk of discarding discriminative cues. QueryDiff directly targets these gaps by shifting from \u201cgiving\u201d altered data to \u201cteaching\u201d semantic structure: it harnesses a pretrained diffusion model not as a generator but as a semantic prior that guides the agent queries toward the inherent scene distribution. This perspective is catalyzed by DreamFusion\u2019s score distillation, which showed that diffusion models can provide gradient-level supervision to external models without explicit sample generation. Together, these works directly shape QueryDiff\u2019s innovation: a query-driven learner that is taught, rather than fed, by a diffusion prior to generalize semantics across unseen domains.",
