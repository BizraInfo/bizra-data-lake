  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014casting Doob\u2019s h-transform as a variational objective (\u201cDoob\u2019s Lagrangian\u201d) that can be trained without simulating vast numbers of rare trajectories\u2014sits at the intersection of conditioning theory, transition path analysis, and variational control. Doob (1957) provides the exact mathematical target: the h-transform that yields the optimally conditioned diffusion for reaching a rare set or fixed endpoint. Transition Path Theory (E & Vanden-Eijnden) identifies the committor as the key object whose logarithmic gradient defines the Doob-transformed dynamics for reactive trajectories, motivating the paper\u2019s boundary-conditioned parameterization.\nSchr\u00f6dinger bridge theory (L\u00e9onard, 2014) contributes the crucial variational lens: conditioning as a path-space KL minimization subject to boundary constraints. This variational viewpoint is operationalized through KL/path-integral control (Kappen, 2005), where optimal control corresponds to an optimal change of path measure relative to the uncontrolled dynamics\u2014precisely the perspective needed to learn the Doob transform without direct rare-event sampling. Methodologically, diffusion bridge constructions (Delyon & Hu, 2006) inform how to encode endpoint constraints into the model so that optimization is conducted over feasible path families by design. Relative to classical Transition Path Sampling (Dellago\u2013Bolhuis\u2013Chandler), which relies on expensive trajectory-space MCMC, the proposed approach learns the optimal twisted dynamics that render transition paths typical. Finally, importance sampling theory for rare events (Dupuis & Wang, 2007) underpins the optimality of the Doob change of measure, reinforcing the paper\u2019s strategy: learn the zero-variance twisting (via a variational principle) rather than estimate it through prohibitively many forward simulations.",
