  "synthesis_narrative": "Mean-field Chaos Diffusion Models (MF-CDMs) fuse two intellectual strands: score-based diffusion modeling and the mean-field analysis of interacting particle systems. On the diffusion side, Hyv\u00e4rinen\u2019s score matching established the basic objective for learning gradients of log densities, and Vincent\u2019s denoising score matching provided the practical denoising formulation later adopted by diffusion models. Sohl-Dickstein et al. introduced the diffusion-based forward\u2013reverse generative paradigm, while Ho et al. operationalized it in DDPMs\u2014methods that implicitly scale poorly for high-cardinality sets because they learn joint scores over all elements. Song et al. then recast diffusion as stochastic differential equations, yielding a continuous-time score framework that MF-CDM directly modifies. On the particle-systems side, McKean\u2019s nonlinear (McKean\u2013Vlasov) processes and Sznitman\u2019s propagation-of-chaos theory supply the precise mechanism by which a large interacting system behaves like independent particles governed by a mean-field law. MF-CDM\u2019s key innovation is to transplant the score-based SDE machinery into this mean-field setting: it defines a per-particle (mean-field) score in the infinite-population limit and derives a denoising score-matching objective for chaotic particle systems. This resolves the curse of dimensionality with respect to cardinality by leveraging propagation of chaos, and it yields practical training via a subdivision scheme while remaining faithful to the diffusion/SDE lineage.",
