  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014actively ranking experts from noisy evaluations taken on many tasks under a monotonicity assumption\u2014sits at the intersection of pure-exploration bandits, experimental design, and ranking. Its information-theoretic backbone is directly inherited from fixed-confidence best-arm identification: the change-of-measure methodology and instance-dependent complexity of Kaufmann, Capp\u00e9, and Garivier provide the template for deriving matching lower bounds in a new structured setting. Building on that, Garivier and Kaufmann\u2019s Track-and-Stop framework informs the stopping and confidence allocation logic that the authors generalize from single-task BAI to multi-task ranking.\nOn the sampling side, the problem naturally becomes one of experimental design over tasks: which task best separates uncertain expert pairs? This is directly inspired by linear-bandit pure exploration work. Soare, Lazaric, and Munos show how to allocate samples over design vectors to estimate pairwise gaps efficiently, and Jedra and Proutiere\u2019s optimal allocation via convex programs guides the instance-adaptive sampling the authors craft for their monotone multi-task model. Classical top-k/ ranking identification (Kalyanakrishnan et al.) provides the principal baseline logic (LUCB-style elimination), which the present work surpasses by exploiting cross-task monotonicity to reduce queries. Finally, the older noisy-sorting literature (Braverman and Mossel) crystallizes the ranking objective and exposes limits of pairwise-comparison-only approaches; the paper directly addresses this by converting the availability of many tasks into an information gain lever, yielding instance-dependent bounds and near-matching lower bounds tailored to the multi-task monotone structure.",
