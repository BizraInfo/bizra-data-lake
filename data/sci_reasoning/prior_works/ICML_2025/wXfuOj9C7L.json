  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014RNN-style layers with linear complexity whose hidden states are themselves learnable models updated via self-supervised steps at test time\u2014sits at the intersection of long-context sequence modeling and test-time adaptation. Transformers defined the long-context performance frontier but at quadratic cost, creating the central motivation to match their scaling without attention\u2019s expense. Linear-time recurrences from S4 and the more recent Mamba established compelling RNN/SSM alternatives; however, their fixed-dimensional hidden states expose limits in expressivity, reflected in weaker perplexity gains beyond long contexts. This limitation directly informs the paper\u2019s core move: making the state a parametric model (linear or MLP) whose parameters are updated online.\n\nThe mechanism for online state updates draws from test-time training and meta-learning. Test-Time Training with self-supervision shows how inference-time optimization can exploit unlabeled inputs, while MAML demonstrates how outer-loop training can endow inner-loop gradient steps with rapid, useful adaptation. The paper operationalizes these insights by treating each token (or subsequence) as an opportunity to run a small self-supervised learning step that updates the state-model, effectively learning-to-learn during inference. Complementary ideas from HyperNetworks validate the notion of dynamic, context-conditioned parameters, pointing to hidden states richer than simple vectors. Finally, linear-attention work offers an alternative route to linear complexity and long-context benefits, sharpening the contrast and emphasizing the novelty of embedding a learned optimizer inside the recurrent state to achieve Transformer-like scaling with RNN-like efficiency.",
