  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014designing convex optimization algorithms by first engineering convergent RLC circuits and then automatically discretizing their dynamics\u2014sits at the confluence of continuous-time optimization, passivity/energy-based system theory, and control-theoretic algorithm synthesis. The ODE lens of optimization (Su\u2013Boyd\u2013Cand\u00e8s) and the Lagrangian/energy-shaping viewpoint (Wibisono\u2013Wilson\u2013Jordan) establish that algorithmic behavior can be prescribed by crafting flows with suitable energy decay, a blueprint mirrored by the circuit stage where objectives and constraints are encoded as dissipative elements. Willems\u2019 dissipativity theory supplies the rigorous link between storage functions, passivity, and stability, ensuring that interconnecting these circuit elements yields trajectories converging to optimizers. Port-Hamiltonian systems (van der Schaft\u2013Jeltsema) provide the structural modeling language for RLC networks, making energy and dissipation explicit and compositional\u2014crucial for modular construction of optimization circuits, including distributed settings. Feijer\u2013Paganini\u2019s passivity-based analysis of primal-dual dynamics translates directly into circuit blocks that implement constraint enforcement via dual variables while preserving stability under interconnection. The second stage leverages IQC-based analysis and synthesis (Lessard\u2013Recht\u2013Packard) to automatically produce discretizations that inherit convergence certificates from the continuous-time design. Finally, classical operator-splitting methods such as ADMM (Gabay\u2013Mercier) appear as specific instances recovered by appropriate circuit interconnections and discretization choices, corroborating both the expressiveness and correctness of the proposed methodology.",
