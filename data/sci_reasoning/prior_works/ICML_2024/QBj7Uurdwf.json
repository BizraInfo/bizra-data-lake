  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014learning useful representations of RNN weight matrices that respect permutation symmetries while capturing functional behavior\u2014sits at the intersection of permutation-equivariant modeling, system identification, and probing-based function representations. Deep Sets and Set Transformer provide the architectural bedrock for permutation-invariant/equivariant mappings on unordered collections, which is essential when encoding layer weights subject to neuron-permutation symmetries. This perspective enables adapting permutation-aware layers to RNN weight tensors so representations reflect network function rather than arbitrary unit order.\n\nOn the functionalist side, Echo State Networks established that recurrent dynamics can be diagnosed through responses to inputs, a principle the paper operationalizes by \u2018interrogating\u2019 RNNs with probe sequences. Classical system identification, particularly the Ho\u2013Kalman framework, underpins the paper\u2019s theoretical results: conditions analogous to observability/controllability guarantee that sufficiently rich probing can recover behavior-relevant representations. Complementing this, Conditional Neural Processes show how functions can be embedded from sparse input\u2013output observations, offering a blueprint for model representations derived from behavioral evidence rather than raw parameters. Task2Vec further supports this by embedding tasks/models based on performance signals on probe data, linking functional embeddings to downstream utility. Finally, mechanistic RNN analyses such as automata extraction (Weiss et al.) frame the contrasting mechanistic baseline, clarifying where weight-inspection excels and where functionalist probing provides richer, alignment-robust summaries. Together, these works directly inform the paper\u2019s dual approach, its permutation-aware encoders, its probing methodology, and its identifiability theory.",
