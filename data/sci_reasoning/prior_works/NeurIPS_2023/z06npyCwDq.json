  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014showing that Pre-RMSNorm and a centered variant (Pre-CRMSNorm) can be made equivalent to Pre-LayerNorm Transformers while being more efficient\u2014rests on a sequence of normalization and architectural insights. Layer Normalization established the standard centering-and-scaling operation widely used in Transformers, especially in the Pre-LN topology analyzed by Xiong et al., which stabilizes training and is now the de facto design. However, RMSNorm, introduced by Zhang and Sennrich, demonstrated that mean-centering may be dispensable, offering a cheaper, mean-free alternative that nonetheless raised concerns about potential representational loss. Nguyen and Salazar\u2019s ScaleNorm further reinforced the idea that norm-only rescaling can suffice for stable training, foreshadowing the paper\u2019s thesis that, in pre-norm residual architectures, the mean component is redundant and can be safely removed or reintroduced in controlled ways. In practice, this theoretical ambiguity has produced a split in large models: T5 exemplifies successful Pre-LN with LayerNorm, while LLaMA popularized Pre-RMSNorm. The present work unifies these lines by supplying explicit mappings and a centered RMSNorm (CRMSNorm) that recover the expressive behavior of Pre-LN without its extra compute, thereby enabling equivalence and efficient conversion between Pre-LN and Pre-RMSNorm-style Transformers. The result resolves a practical fragmentation in model design and provides a principled foundation for choosing or converting between normalization schemes.",
