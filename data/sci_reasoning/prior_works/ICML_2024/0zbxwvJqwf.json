  "synthesis_narrative": "LatProtRL\u2019s key idea\u2014treating protein sequence optimization as reinforcement learning over a learned latent manifold\u2014sits at the intersection of two influential threads. First, G\u00f3mez-Bombarelli et al. introduced the foundational notion of navigating a smooth encoder\u2013decoder latent space to optimize discrete biochemical objects, while Riesselman et al. showed that such latent spaces trained on protein sequences capture functional constraints relevant to fitness. Building on these, LatProtRL retains the encoder\u2013decoder latent substrate but replaces Bayesian or gradient-based search with an RL policy that can deliberately explore and escape local optima. The second thread is RL-driven design: You et al.\u2019s GCPN crystallized the MDP framing for goal-directed molecule generation, and GFlowNets emphasized exploration to discover diverse high-reward structures. LatProtRL draws on these insights to model optimization as an MDP in latent space, explicitly targeting robust traversal from low-fitness starting points. The immediate motivation comes from gaps in oracle-guided generative design and BO-based protein engineering: CbAS and Low-N BO approaches effectively steer toward high-scoring sequences but often remain near the training distribution or exploit locally, making them sensitive to initial seeds. Design-Bench further codified the black-box design setup and revealed over-optimization pitfalls on protein tasks. LatProtRL directly addresses these limitations by coupling a protein latent manifold with an RL policy, enabling broader, more reliable exploration to reach high-fitness regions, as validated against established baselines.",
