  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution is an LDP-based bridge that, for any adaptive sampling algorithm, links the large deviations of empirical arm-selection proportions to those of empirical rewards. This enables explicit error-exponent analyses in the fixed-budget best arm identification (BAI) setting and yields sharper bounds for classic methods like Successive Rejects (SR). Audibert\u2013Bubeck\u2013Munos (2010) established SR/SAR as canonical fixed-budget baselines, providing the immediate algorithmic target whose error probabilities this work refines. The information-theoretic perspective developed by Kaufmann\u2013Capp\u00e9\u2013Garivier (2016) and Garivier\u2013Kaufmann (2016) showed that pure exploration is governed by optimization over sampling proportions weighted by Kullback\u2013Leibler divergences\u2014insight that the present paper translates from fixed-confidence to fixed-budget via a principled LDP connection. Degenne\u2013Koolen (2019) sharpened change-of-measure lower bounds and clarified the geometry of alternatives that dominate errors; this geometry directly informs which deviations control the error exponent once proportions and rewards are coupled through LDPs. On the technical side, classical LD results for fixed designs (Chernoff, 1959) provide the static error exponents and optimal allocations that serve as a benchmark. The formal apparatus to connect random empirical draw proportions to reward summaries under adaptivity rests on Sanov\u2019s theorem and the contraction principle (Dembo\u2013Zeitouni, 1998). Together, these works supply the algorithmic benchmarks, information-geometric objectives, and LD machinery that the paper synthesizes to analyze adaptive fixed-budget BAI and to tighten SR\u2019s error bounds.",
