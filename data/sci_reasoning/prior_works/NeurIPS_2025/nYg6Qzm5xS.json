  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of the paper is a constructive, depth-2 representation of induction-head behavior that realizes any-order Markov (conditional k-gram) processes with a single attention head\u2014closing a gap where prior best-known constructions for higher-order dependencies used at least three layers. This advance is rooted in the mechanistic interpretability line establishing induction heads. Elhage et al. introduced the induction-head circuit, and Olsson et al. connected it empirically to conditional n-gram behavior, motivating a formal treatment of k-gram/Markov ICL. On the theoretical side, expressivity results for constant-depth transformers by Yun et al. supply design tools showing how two layers can implement nontrivial sequence-to-sequence mappings, while Hahn\u2019s lower bounds clarify why a single layer faces intrinsic limitations, aligning with observations that depth-1 requires exponential width for induction-like tasks. Complementing these, Garg et al. provide provable depth-2 ICL constructions and depth\u2013width separations on simple function classes, offering a blueprint for how to craft and analyze circuits that perform in-context computations without relying on training dynamics. Finally, Geva et al.\u2019s view of FFNs as key\u2013value memories informs the storage and retrieval of k-gram statistics required by the construction. Together, these works directly enable the paper\u2019s main result: a precise, provable, two-layer single-head architecture that implements induction for arbitrary-order Markov sources, thereby sharpening our understanding of how depth governs ICL capacity in transformers.",
