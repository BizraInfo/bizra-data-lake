  "synthesis_narrative": "Pan-LUT\u2019s core idea\u2014decomposing pan-sharpening into spectral mapping and spatial detail injection while executing both via learnable LUTs\u2014stands on two converging lines of prior work. From pan-sharpening itself, Masi et al. pioneered the deep learning formulation, and PanNet became a dominant baseline using PAN-driven detail injection. DiCNN sharpened the conceptual split: perform channel-wise spectral mapping and inject PAN details. Pan-LUT directly adopts this decomposition but replaces cost-heavy convolutions with LUT primitives to unlock extreme efficiency on very large images. From the efficient image enhancement/restoration side, Chen et al.\u2019s deep bilateral learning showed that a guidance signal can index into a parametric grid to drive local transformations; Pan-LUT\u2019s PGLUT similarly uses the PAN image as a guidance axis to control channel-wise spectral mapping. Zeng et al. demonstrated that learnable 3D LUTs, coupled with interpolation, can model complex color transforms in real time\u2014Pan-LUT extends this LUT learning paradigm to multi-spectral\u2013PAN fusion. Complementing that, SR-LUT showed how local patch-based LUT indexing captures spatial structure efficiently, echoing Pan-LUT\u2019s SDLUT for PAN detail extraction. Framed within Vivone et al.\u2019s taxonomy and metrics, Pan-LUT thus emerges by fusing detail-injection pan-sharpening principles with modern learnable LUT mechanisms to deliver strong accuracy with drastically reduced inference cost.",
