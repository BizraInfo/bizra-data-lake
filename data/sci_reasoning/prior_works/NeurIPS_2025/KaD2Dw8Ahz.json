  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014training a single flat goal-conditioned policy by bootstrapping from subgoal-conditioned policies with advantage-weighted importance sampling\u2014sits at the intersection of goal-conditioned learning, hierarchical subgoal methods, and advantage-weighted offline policy improvement. Universal Value Function Approximators formalized conditioning on goals, providing the representational backbone for a flat, generalist goal policy. Hindsight Experience Replay tackled sparse rewards through relabeling, enabling effective reuse of reward-free trajectories, a prerequisite for scalable offline GCRL. Building directly on this offline, reward-free paradigm, GCSL showed that one can pretrain goal policies from unlabeled trajectories via supervised updates; the present work extends this idea to longer horizons by leveraging subgoal policies rather than introducing hierarchical modules.\n\nOn the long-horizon front, HIRO established that subgoal-conditioned controllers markedly improve credit assignment over extended horizons. Rather than adopt hierarchical stacks with their added complexity, the new approach flattens the hierarchy by distilling the competence of subgoal policies into a single policy. To accomplish this safely in the offline setting, the method draws on the advantage-weighted policy regression lineage. AWR introduced weighting updates by estimated advantages; AWAC adapted this to offline-to-online learning while staying close to the behavior support. IQL further demonstrated stable offline policy extraction using advantage-based weighting without explicit importance sampling. Synthesizing these strands, the paper applies advantage-weighted importance sampling to subgoal-conditioned data, capturing the credit-assignment benefits of hierarchies while avoiding modular policies and explicit subgoal generation.",
