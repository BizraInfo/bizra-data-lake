  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014deriving high-quality subgoals from experience via loop-removal\u2014sits at the intersection of hierarchical RL, goal-conditioned learning, and trajectory mining. Sutton, Precup, and Singh\u2019s options framework defined the abstraction target: temporally extended goals that accelerate long-horizon control. Early subgoal discovery from trajectories (McGovern & Barto) proved that experience contains structural cues to useful bottlenecks, a principle the present work revives without hand-crafted detectors by instead applying loop-removal to isolate true progress states. Spectral approaches such as eigenoptions (Machado et al.) showed how global transition structure can reveal options, but they rely on constructing or sampling a large state graph; in contrast, the proposed method remains local and scalable by operating directly on replay buffers. HER (Andrychowicz et al.) established replay as a rich source of goal signals; here, replay is further leveraged\u2014not just to relabel goals but to algorithmically compress trajectories into subgoal sequences, synergizing with goal-conditioned learners enabled by UVFA (Schaul et al.). Relative to learned high-level controllers (HIRO), the goal-reducer provides a lightweight, off-policy-compatible subgoal generator that can plug into DQN and SAC. Finally, the loop-removal step draws conceptual lineage from loop-erased random walks (Wilson), providing a principled means to eliminate cycles and distill essential paths, which directly underpins the proposed goal reduction mechanism.",
