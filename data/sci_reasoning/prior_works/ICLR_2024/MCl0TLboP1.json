  "synthesis_narrative": "Temporal-Difference learning introduced the \u03bb-return, showing that a convex blend of Monte-Carlo and bootstrapped targets can systematically navigate the bias\u2013variance tradeoff; this established that mixing targets is a principled way to improve value estimation. Potential-based reward shaping then proved that one can transform rewards (and effectively discounts) without changing optimal policies, providing a theoretical conduit to reparameterize modified backups as simple dataset relabeling. In offline reinforcement learning, BEAR identified bootstrapping error accumulation under distribution shift as a core failure mode, highlighting that blindly propagating TD targets from out-of-distribution regions degrades learning. Conservative Q-Learning operationalized pessimism within value backups to mitigate overestimation while remaining fundamentally bootstrapping-based. TD3+BC demonstrated that even minimalist TD bootstrapping coupled with behavior cloning can be competitive in offline settings, underscoring the centrality\u2014and fragility\u2014of TD targets. Implicit Q-Learning showed that changing the value-learning objective (expectiles) can alleviate distribution shift, yet it still depends on bootstrapped value propagation.\nTogether, these works reveal both the power and pitfalls of bootstrapping in offline RL and that blending targets can reduce estimation complexity. The natural next step is to fuse Monte-Carlo returns from the dataset with TD backups, weighting toward MC on high-return, reliable trajectories, and to implement this blend via reward/discount relabeling guaranteed by shaping theory. This synthesis directly addresses bootstrapping error while preserving the plug-and-play structure of leading offline RL algorithms.",

    "abstract": "We propose **H**e**u**ristic **Bl**ending (HUBL), a simple performance-improving technique for a broad class of offline RL algorithms based on value bootstrapping. HUBL modifies the Bellman operators used in these algorithms, partially replacing the bootstrapped values with heuristic ones that are estimated with Monte-Carlo returns. For trajectories with higher returns, HUBL relies more on the heuristic values and less on bootstrapping; otherwise, it leans more heavily on bootstrapping. HUBL is very easy to combine with many existing offline RL implementations by relabeling the offline datasets with adjusted rewards and discount factors. We derive a theory that explains HUBL's effect on offline RL as reducing offline RL's complexity and thus increasing its finite-sample performance.  Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that HUBL consistently improves the policy quality of four state-of-the-art bootstrapping-based offline RL algorithms (ATAC, CQL, TD3+BC, and IQL), by 9% on average ",
