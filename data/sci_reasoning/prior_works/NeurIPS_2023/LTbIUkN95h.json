  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014sample-efficient RL in mixed systems by augmenting data through deterministic pseudo-stochastic transitions\u2014sits at the confluence of structural RL, batch RL theory, and queueing-network dynamics. From Sutton\u2019s Dyna, it inherits the central idea that simulated or model-consistent experience can accelerate learning; here, the model is not learned but implicitly available through the deterministic mapping from stochastic to pseudo-stochastic states. PEGASUS crystallizes this perspective by treating transitions as deterministic functions of state, action, and exogenous noise, precisely the viewpoint that enables generating augmented samples consistent with the underlying randomness.\nAlgorithmically and theoretically, the work builds on Fitted Q-Iteration (Ernst et al.), employing a batch approach amenable to analysis. Finite-sample tools and concentrability-style coverage notions from the FQI literature (e.g., Antos\u2013Szepesv\u00e1ri\u2013Munos) are adapted to show that augmentation relaxes the coverage requirement to only the stochastic-state component. This mirrors classic insights from factored MDPs (Kearns\u2013Koller): exploiting known structure can drastically reduce sample complexity.\nModern model-based rollouts (MBPO) reinforce the idea that carefully controlled, short-horizon synthetic samples can boost sample efficiency without full-blown model reliance; the present paper operationalizes an analogous benefit via exact pseudo-deterministic transitions rather than a learned model. Finally, queueing-network fundamentals (Tassiulas\u2013Ephremides) motivate the mixed-system decomposition\u2014exogenous stochastic arrivals with deterministic queue updates\u2014and anchor the practical applications that showcase the method\u2019s gains.",
