  "synthesis_narrative": "TabFlex\u2019s core innovation\u2014scaling in-context tabular learning to millions of samples\u2014rests squarely on two threads of prior work. First, TabPFN established the problem formulation and paradigm: training a transformer to perform amortized Bayesian-like inference for tabular classification in-context, delivering training-free adaptability. However, TabPFN\u2019s quadratic self-attention becomes the critical bottleneck as context length grows with more samples, features, and classes. Second, the linear-time sequence modeling literature provides the remedy. Linear attention methods, notably the kernel-based formulation of Katharopoulos et al. and the FAVOR+ approximation from Performer, show how to preserve the benefits of attention while reducing complexity to O(n). TabFlex directly leverages these linear-attention ideas as a drop-in replacement for TabPFN\u2019s self-attention, converting the dominant quadratic cost into linear scaling and thereby enabling million-sample contexts. Complementing this, state-space model advances (S4 and Mamba) independently validate that linear-time sequence architectures can rival transformers, informing TabFlex\u2019s design choices and comparisons for handling long tabular sequences. Finally, XGBoost represents the established large-scale tabular baseline that TabFlex aims to surpass on efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Together, these works directly shape TabFlex: TabPFN provides the in-context tabular learning blueprint and limitation; linear attention provides the enabling technique; and modern linear-time sequence modeling and XGBoost frame the scalability targets and competitive landscape.",
