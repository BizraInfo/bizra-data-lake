  "synthesis_narrative": "The core of \u201cVariational Diffusion Posterior Sampling with Midpoint Guidance\u201d is a new way to target the Bayesian posterior with diffusion priors by altering the reverse transitions so that the intractable guidance term becomes simpler, controllable, and numerically stable. This lineage begins with score-based diffusion foundations (Song et al., 2020), which provide the reverse-time dynamics and pre-trained time-dependent scores used as priors. Building on this, Song et al. (2021) concretized inverse problems with score priors, framing posterior sampling as operating on a surrogate diffusion whose score splits into two parts: a known prior score and a likelihood term. Dhariwal and Nichol (2021) popularized precisely this score decomposition in classifier guidance, directly inspiring the prior+guidance formulation adopted by posterior samplers.\nChung et al. (2023, DPS) then made this decomposition the central tool for diffusion posterior sampling, but exposed a practical roadblock: the likelihood-score term is typically intractable and expensive to estimate (often via Monte Carlo over latent variables). The present paper squarely targets that gap by proposing a variational decomposition of the reverse transitions and a midpoint guidance scheme that trades complexity from the guidance into the prior transitions. This mirrors, in spirit, variational path-measure ideas from Diffusion Schr\u00f6dinger Bridges (De Bortoli et al., 2021), which redistribute modeling burden between base dynamics and corrective drifts. Finally, DDRM (Kawar et al., 2022) serves as a complementary baseline limited to linear degradations, underscoring the need for a general posterior-sampling approach that the proposed method delivers across linear and nonlinear settings.",
