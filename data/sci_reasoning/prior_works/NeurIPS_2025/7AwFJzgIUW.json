  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014dynamical low-rank training augmented by a spectral regularizer that controls each layer\u2019s low-rank core condition number\u2014stands at the intersection of two lines of prior work: low-rank modeling for efficiency and spectral control for robustness. On the efficiency side, Koch and Lubich (2007) introduced dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA), providing the geometric framework to evolve factored representations on a low-rank manifold. Lubich and Oseledets (2014) supplied projector-splitting integrators that make such low-rank evolution numerically stable and efficient. These tools enable end-to-end training directly in factorized form with the possibility of rank adaptivity. Practical evidence that deep networks are amenable to low-rank parameterization comes from Denton et al. (2014), who demonstrated effective SVD-based compression, and Tai et al. (2016), who advocated inducing low rank during training via regularization\u2014both directly supporting the paper\u2019s training-time compression strategy.\nOn the robustness side, Cisse et al. (2017) showed that enforcing orthogonality (thus bounding spectral norms) improves adversarial robustness, while Yoshida and Miyato (2017) formalized spectral norm regularization as a stability mechanism. Tsuzuku et al. (2018) connected spectral bounds to Lipschitz constants and certified margins, reinforcing the principle that controlling singular values enhances robustness. The present work synthesizes these strands by moving from simple spectral norm control to explicit condition number regulation within low-rank cores, mitigating sensitivity to adversarial perturbations without sacrificing clean accuracy, and leveraging DLRA machinery to retain model- and data-agnostic, rank-adaptive compression.",
