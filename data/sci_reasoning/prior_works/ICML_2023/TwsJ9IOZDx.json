  "synthesis_narrative": "SFNO\u2019s core innovation\u2014learning global operator maps natively on the sphere\u2014emerges by unifying two direct lines of prior work. On the operator-learning side, DeepONet established learning maps between function spaces, and the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) operationalized this with efficient global spectral convolutions that capture long-range dependencies. However, FNO assumes Euclidean geometry and relies on planar DFTs. When this Euclidean assumption was carried over to global atmospheric prediction in FourCastNet, artifacts such as grid-imprinting near the poles, distorted spectra, and increased dissipation were observed, especially in long autoregressive rollouts. These concrete limitations form the explicit gap SFNO targets.\n\nConcurrently, the geometric deep learning community showed how to correctly process spherical data: Spherical CNNs (Cohen et al.; Esteves et al.) demonstrated that convolutions on the sphere should be defined in the spherical harmonic domain to respect spherical geometry and rotational structure. SFNO directly adopts this spherical spectral perspective but integrates it into the neural-operator framework\u2014replacing FNO\u2019s DFT with spherical harmonic transforms and learning spectral multipliers on the sphere\u2014thereby enabling resolution-independent operator learning without the flat-geometry mismatch. WeatherBench provides the standardized, global forecasting setup on spherical grids that SFNO uses to demonstrate its key outcome: stable, physically plausible long-horizon rollouts. In sum, SFNO explicitly extends FNO to the sphere, motivated by FourCastNet\u2019s observed failures with planar FFTs, and is technically inspired by the spherical-harmonic convolution machinery pioneered in Spherical CNNs.",
