  "synthesis_narrative": "SynEVO\u2019s core contribution\u2014breaking model independence in spatiotemporal learning via neuro-inspired evolution with shared, cross-domain intelligence\u2014sits at the intersection of curriculum learning, continual learning, and domain generalization. Bengio et al.\u2019s curriculum learning directly motivates SynEVO\u2019s sample-group reordering, which stabilizes optimization as domains are incorporated. To enable model growth without catastrophic forgetting, SynEVO draws on continual learning: Progressive Neural Networks provide the architectural notion of expandable capacity with lateral knowledge reuse, while EWC contributes elastic consolidation to protect previously acquired shared representations. These ideas are fused into SynEVO\u2019s \u2018elastic common container,\u2019 which retains cross-domain commonality as the system evolves.\n\nFor robust transfer, SynEVO\u2019s task-independent extractor builds on DANN\u2019s domain-adversarial representation learning, embedding invariance in a multi-domain, evolving framework rather than a fixed source\u2013target setting. At the same time, IRM\u2019s formalization of invariance across environments highlights a gap: invariances are not static, especially in real spatiotemporal systems. SynEVO responds by learning collective intelligence that adapts and expands as new domains arrive, effectively pushing the information boundary beyond what fixed-invariance methods achieve. Finally, strong single-domain spatiotemporal models such as DCRNN and meta-learning baselines like MAML situate the practical baseline landscape: the former underscore the transfer limitation of independent per-domain training, while the latter show the limits of rapid adaptation without persistent shared consolidation. SynEVO integrates these strands into a cohesive, evolving cross-domain framework.",
