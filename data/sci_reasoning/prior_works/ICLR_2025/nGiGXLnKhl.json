  "synthesis_narrative": "Vision-RWKV\u2019s core idea\u2014bringing RWKV\u2019s linear-time, parallel-trainable recurrence to vision for truly global processing at high resolution\u2014traces directly to RWKV\u2019s architectural design. RWKV introduced the time-mix/channel-mix mechanism that marries RNN-style state with Transformer-like capacity; VRWKV extends this operator to 2D spatial tokens with vision-specific modifications. ViT provided the problem formulation and principal baseline: patch tokenization and globally receptive backbones for image understanding. However, as resolutions scale, window-based systems such as Swin Transformer expose a key gap: efficiency is purchased at the cost of window operations and restricted per-layer global communication\u2014precisely what VRWKV removes while keeping linear aggregation complexity. In parallel, the broader movement toward attention-free sequence modeling informed VRWKV\u2019s design space. RetNet demonstrated that linear-time retention can rival Transformers, and Mamba showed selective state spaces as another successful operator class; these works validated that attention is not necessary for long-context, high-capacity models. Their visual adaptation, VMamba, further identified practical limitations\u2014scan-order anisotropy and difficulty with sparse/masked tokens\u2014that VRWKV targets by using RWKV-like global mixing without windows or scans. Finally, MAE\u2019s masked image modeling established a sparse-input setting that VRWKV explicitly supports, enabling efficient processing of masked images. Together, these works form the direct intellectual lineage VRWKV builds upon and the gaps it resolves.",
