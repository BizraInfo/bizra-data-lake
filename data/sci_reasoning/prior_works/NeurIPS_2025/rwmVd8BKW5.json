  "synthesis_narrative": "Universal Sequence Preconditioning builds on two complementary lines: online time-series prediction for LDS and spectral polynomial techniques that reshape operator spectra. Spectral filtering for LDS provided a practical baseline for prediction and regret analysis, but prior guarantees typically incurred dependence on hidden dimension and often favored well-behaved (e.g., symmetric/normal) transitions. The paper\u2019s key insight\u2014that convolving the input implements a polynomial of the hidden transition\u2014connects LDS prediction with classical spectrum-shaping methods. This mirrors Chebyshev-based preconditioning in numerical linear algebra, where carefully chosen polynomials attenuate undesirable spectral components, and leverages well-established stability and efficiency of Chebyshev approximations to spectral filters. The Legendre family\u2019s role in recent sequence modeling (HiPPO) further motivates orthogonal polynomials as principled, stable bases for long-horizon information processing.\n\nWithin the online-learning perspective introduced for time-series, this spectral viewpoint enables a universal preconditioner: convolving inputs with Chebyshev/Legendre coefficients to uniformly improve regret for a broad class of predictors. Applying this to spectral filtering yields the first sublinear, hidden-dimension\u2013free (up to logs) regret bound that also covers asymmetric transitions\u2014closing a gap left by earlier analyses. Conceptually, the work fuses Kalman-style LDS prediction with online regret guarantees via a simple, computationally light preconditioning step that implicitly applies a matrix polynomial to the unknown transition, thereby delivering robust, architecture-agnostic gains across sequential prediction methods.",
