  "synthesis_narrative": "Directional message passing introduced the idea that molecular interactions should depend not only on distances but also on angles between bonds; DimeNet operationalized this with spherical Bessel/harmonics-based triplet embeddings that encode directionality into messages. GemNet further systematized edge\u2013triplet updates and multi-level directional interactions, showing that carefully engineered directional pathways can dominate on molecular property benchmarks. In parallel, equivariant message passing matured: PaiNN provided a practical scalar\u2013vector decomposition that preserves SE(3) symmetry while enabling efficient updates of geometric features, and EGNN distilled E(n)-equivariance into lightweight coordinate-aware message passing. SE(3)-Transformer demonstrated fully equivariant attention via tensor products and spherical harmonics, highlighting the power\u2014but also the rigidity and computational burden\u2014of enforcing strict equivariance in every layer. The OC20 IS2RE task underscored the need for models that capture anisotropic, orientation-dependent interactions while respecting symmetry, cementing the value of both directional mechanisms and equivariance. Taken together, these works revealed a gap: purely equivariant stacks can be over-constrained, while purely directional models may lack principled symmetry handling. The natural next step was to hybridize, retaining a strictly equivariant scalar\u2013vector pathway (in the spirit of PaiNN/EGNN) and fusing it with learnable, angle-aware directional modules (as in DimeNet/GemNet). This synthesis addresses the expressivity\u2013symmetry trade-off exposed by SE(3)-Transformer and related methods, yielding a flexible yet physically grounded architecture tailored to benchmarks like OC20 and QM9.",

    "abstract": "Equivariant message passing neural networks have emerged as the prevailing approach for predicting chemical properties of molecules due to their ability to leverage translation and rotation symmetries, resulting in a strong inductive bias. However, the equivariant operations in each layer can impose excessive constraints on the function form and network flexibility. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel network called the Hybrid Directional Graph Neural Network (HDGNN), which effectively combines strictly equivariant operations with learnable modules. We evaluate the performance of HDGNN on the QM9 dataset and the IS2RE dataset of OC20, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance on several tasks and competitive performance on others. Our code is anonymously released on https://github.com/ajy112/HDGNN.",
