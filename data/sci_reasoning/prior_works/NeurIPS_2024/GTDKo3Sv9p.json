  "synthesis_narrative": "Discrete Flow Matching (DFM) sits at the intersection of flow-based generative modeling and discrete diffusion. Flow Matching provided the central blueprint: learn a vector field defined by an explicit probability path connecting source and target distributions. Stochastic Interpolants generalized this idea, formalizing families of probability paths and their associated transport dynamics. Together, these works enable DFM\u2019s first contribution: operating over a general family of discrete probability paths rather than a fixed corruption chain.\nOn the sampling side, the score-based SDE and DDPM literature established that denoising targets (\u03b5-pred and x0-pred) can parameterize posteriors and drive deterministic or stochastic sampling along a path. DFM imports this machinery into discrete spaces, deriving generic discrete sampling formulas using learned posteriors analogous to the continuous \u03b5/x0 parameterizations. Practical scheduler design\u2014popularized in Improved DDPM\u2014motivates DFM\u2019s exploration of discrete path schedulers, which the authors show materially improves perplexity.\nFinally, discrete predecessors are crucial: D3PM introduced principled discrete-state diffusion with categorical corruption matrices and exact posteriors, providing the scaffolding DFM generalizes beyond (from fixed Markov chains to broader paths). Earlier discrete flows (Integer Discrete Flows) demonstrated the promise\u2014and constraints\u2014of invertible transforms on discrete data. DFM advances this lineage by casting generation as probability-path transport with learned posterior denoisers, enabling scalable, high-quality modeling of high-dimensional discrete sequences.",
