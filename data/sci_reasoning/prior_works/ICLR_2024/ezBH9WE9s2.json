  "synthesis_narrative": "ControlNet established a practical route to inject structured conditions into a frozen diffusion backbone via a dedicated control branch, enabling faithful adherence to external maps. T2I-Adapter further showed that lightweight adapters can align diverse conditional inputs to a pretrained text-to-image model without full retraining. GLIGEN introduced region-level grounding with bounding boxes, demonstrating that spatial control can reliably direct where content should appear. TextDiffuser revealed that rendering glyphs and layouts as explicit controls markedly improves legibility in text-in-image synthesis, while GlyphControl found that conditioning on glyphs benefits complex scripts like Chinese, though both approaches were limited in language breadth and lacked recognition-aware semantics. STEFANN earlier crystallized the scene text editing problem\u2014precisely replacing text within existing images\u2014though relying on GANs. In parallel, OCR advances such as ABINet highlighted that recognizers produce rich character-sequence representations that encode semantics beyond visual appearance.\nTogether, these works suggested a path: combine strong structural control (ControlNet/T2I-Adapter), spatial grounding (GLIGEN), and glyph priors (TextDiffuser/GlyphControl) with recognition-aware embeddings (OCR) to both place and spell text correctly. AnyText synthesizes these insights via an auxiliary latent module that fuses glyph, position, and masked image for controllable generation/editing, and a text embedding module that injects OCR-derived stroke/sequence cues for multilingual accuracy\u2014addressing the legibility and language limitations of prior text-rendering diffusion systems.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion model based Text-to-Image has achieved impressive achievements recently. Although current technology for synthesizing images is highly advanced and capable of generating images with high fidelity, it is still possible to give the show away when focusing on the text area in the generated image, as synthesized text often contains blurred, unreadable, or incorrect characters, making visual text generation one of the most challenging issues in this field. To address this issue, we introduce AnyText, a diffusion-based multilingual visual text generation and editing model, that focuses on rendering accurate and coherent text in the image. AnyText comprises a diffusion pipeline with two primary elements: an auxiliary latent module and a text embedding module. The former uses inputs like text glyph, position, and masked image to generate latent features for text generation or editing. The latter employs an OCR model for encoding stroke data as embeddings, which blend with image capti",
