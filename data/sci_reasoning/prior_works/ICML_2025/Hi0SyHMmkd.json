  "synthesis_narrative": "This paper frames creativity as a stochastic, multi-step planning problem and argues that next-token prediction is inherently myopic for such open-ended tasks. Foundational advances in discrete diffusion (Austin et al., 2021) and their application to language (Li et al., 2022) directly inform the claim that non-autoregressive, multi-token denoising better explores global solution spaces, yielding more diverse and controllable outputs than autoregressive decoding. In parallel, Generative Flow Networks (Bengio et al., 2022) provide a teacherless, trajectory-based framework that explicitly encourages exploration of multiple high-reward modes, aligning with the paper\u2019s call for stochastic construction rather than local likelihood maximization.\nSelf-improvement without external supervision is grounded in STaR (Zelikman et al., 2022), which demonstrates teacherless training can bootstrap complex reasoning skills. At inference time, the benefits of sampling and exploring multiple token trajectories are established by Self-Consistency (Wang et al., 2023) and Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al., 2023), both of which show that deliberate multi-path search over multi-token sequences outperforms greedy, token-by-token choices\u2014mirroring the paper\u2019s \u201cstochastic planning step.\u201d Finally, POET (Wang et al., 2019) contributes the open-endedness perspective: creative progress emerges from continual, stochastic exploration across evolving problem spaces, motivating the paper\u2019s minimal algorithmic tasks that abstract real-world creative leaps. Together, these works underpin the paper\u2019s central thesis and its emphasis on diffusion and teacherless training, as well as its design of tests that expose the limits of next-token prediction.",
