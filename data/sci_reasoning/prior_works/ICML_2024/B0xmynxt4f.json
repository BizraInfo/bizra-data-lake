  "synthesis_narrative": "DISCRET\u2019s core innovation\u2014faithful, per-instance rule explanations that double as database queries for individual treatment effect estimation\u2014arises from the convergence of interpretable causal partitioning, local rule-based explanations, and matching principles. Causal Trees and Causal Forests established that treatment effect heterogeneity can be estimated by forming partitions or neighborhoods and averaging within them; DISCRET internalizes this notion at the instance level by synthesizing a compact rule that defines a localized, data-driven neighborhood for each prediction. From uplift modeling, DISCRET inherits the explicit optimization for treatment contrast, ensuring that the retrieved subgroup is not only similar but informative about differential effects. Anchors demonstrated that short, high-precision rules can delineate faithful local regions, but being post-hoc, they lack guarantees; DISCRET makes the rule the mechanism of prediction, thus making faithfulness intrinsic. Rule-list research such as CORELS showed that discrete rule spaces can be searched effectively for compact, interpretable models; DISCRET adapts this idea with a novel reinforcement learning search procedure tuned to causal objectives and per-sample rule synthesis rather than a single global model. Finally, classical propensity score work provides the conceptual foundation for using similarity-based retrieval to reduce confounding; DISCRET reinterprets this as learning rule queries that implicitly perform stratification. Against strong black-box ITE methods based on representation learning, DISCRET aims to retain competitive accuracy while providing faithful, transparent explanations that generalize across tabular, image, and text modalities.",
