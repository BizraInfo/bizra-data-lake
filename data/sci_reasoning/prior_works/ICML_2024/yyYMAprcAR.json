  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation is to make precise that tying input and output embeddings in language models implicitly assumes the distributional hypothesis. This lineage begins with Harris (1954) and Firth (1957), who articulated that word meaning is determined by distributional context; the present work operationalizes that idea within modern neural LMs by showing input embeddings capture semantic similarity while output embeddings capture contextual similarity, and that tying equates the two. The practical technique under scrutiny\u2014weight tying\u2014originates in Press and Wolf (2017) and was further systematized by Inan et al. (2017), who demonstrated empirical gains but did not specify when tying is theoretically justified. Levy and Goldberg (2014) provided the crucial bridge from distributional linguistics to neural embedding theory by proving that popular word embedding objectives factorize word\u2013context PMI matrices, supporting the claim that output embeddings encode contextual relationships. Yet, Yang et al. (2018) exposed a tension: tying and standard softmax can reduce representational rank, raising doubts about universal benefits. The present paper unifies these threads, explaining that tying is appropriate precisely when the distributional hypothesis holds for the data, thereby reconciling the empirical success of weight tying with its potential expressivity costs and offering a principled guideline for when to tie embeddings.",
