  "synthesis_narrative": "BaxBench\u2019s core contribution\u2014evaluating whether LLMs can produce correct and secure, production-style backend modules\u2014sits at the intersection of test-driven code generation, repository-scale integration, and secure software engineering. Early function-level benchmarks such as HumanEval and MBPP established automated, unit-test-based evaluation for short, self-contained tasks, demonstrating that LLMs can generate correct functions under clear specifications. APPS extended this to more challenging algorithmic problems with hidden tests, reinforcing the importance of rigorous validation at scale. CodeXGLUE unified evaluation practices and task taxonomies for code intelligence, shaping norms around standardized metrics and reproducible protocols that BaxBench adopts and extends.\n\nHowever, generating backends requires multi-file coordination, API design, data persistence, and integration correctness. AlphaCode\u2019s test-driven selection and large-scale validation inspired BaxBench\u2019s scalable verification philosophy, while Defects4J\u2019s use of real regression tests influenced BaxBench\u2019s choice to validate behavior with integration-style tests rather than only unit checks. Crucially, evidence that LLMs produce vulnerable code\u2014highlighted by the Copilot security study\u2014directly motivated BaxBench to embed security as a first-class criterion, incorporating vulnerability-aware specifications and checks reflective of deployment-facing risks. Together, these lines of work converge in BaxBench\u2019s design: moving beyond single-function or algorithmic tasks to end-to-end backend generation with automated correctness and security evaluation, providing a realistic and stringent test of whether LLMs can build production-quality backend services.",
