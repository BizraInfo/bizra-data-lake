  "synthesis_narrative": "SARDet-100K\u2019s core contributions\u2014unifying fragmented SAR detection datasets into a large-scale, COCO-level multi-class benchmark and releasing an open-source toolkit\u2014draw directly on two lines of prior work: large-scale detection benchmarks/toolboxes and existing SAR detection datasets. First, COCO established the template for modern detection benchmarks, including scale, COCO-style JSON annotations, and standardized mAP metrics; SARDet-100K explicitly targets COCO-level scope and inherits its evaluation conventions. In remote sensing, DOTA demonstrated how to adapt large-scale object detection to aerial imagery, influencing SARDet-100K\u2019s multi-class scope, data curation principles, and evaluation in a domain with unique viewing geometries. Operationally, MMDetection provided the modular, COCO-compatible training and evaluation infrastructure that SARDet-100K extends to ensure reproducible baselines and broad detector coverage. Second, the benchmark\u2019s substance comes from consolidating established SAR detection datasets that were previously small, mono-class, and siloed. OpenSARShip (Sentinel-1) and HRSID contributed high-resolution maritime scenes, SSDD added a widely adopted ship corpus, and SAR-Aircraft-1.0 supplied non-ship categories, enabling true multi-class detection. Standardizing these sources into a single, quality-controlled benchmark enabled comprehensive cross-sensor and cross-category experiments. This consolidation, together with a unified toolkit, allowed the authors to rigorously expose the performance gap between RGB-pretrained models and SAR fine-tuning, a challenge that was difficult to quantify before the availability of a large, diverse SAR benchmark.",
