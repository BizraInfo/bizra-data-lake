  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014a solvable, high-dimensional model of dot\u2011product self\u2011attention that exhibits a sharp phase transition between positional and semantic learning\u2014rests on two pillars: the mechanics of attention and the statistical\u2011physics toolkit for exact asymptotics. Vaswani et al. furnish the precise dot\u2011product attention and positional encodings that the authors distill into a one-layer, low\u2011rank Q/K setting. Empirical interpretability work on induction heads (Olsson/Elhage/Nanda et al.) delineates positional circuitry versus semantic patterns, directly motivating the two regimes whose competition is analyzed here. The broader notion of abrupt capability onsets (Wei et al.) frames the target phenomenon as an emergent transition to be theoretically explained.\nOn the methodological side, solvable high\u2011dimensional analyses are enabled by AMP/state\u2011evolution (Bayati & Montanari) and the statistical\u2011physics view of planted inference and detectability transitions (Decelle, Krzakala, Moore, Zdeborov\u00e1). These works establish how to compute exact limits and identify thresholds where latent structure becomes recoverable. The BBP spiked\u2011covariance transition provides the canonical template for when a low\u2011rank signal emerges from noise, mirroring the point at which semantic attention overtakes positional heuristics. Finally, mean\u2011field analyses of nonconvex networks (Mei, Montanari, Nguyen) clarify how large\u2011dimension limits can yield closed\u2011form characterizations of global minima in nonlinear models. Together, these strands enable the present paper to precisely characterize the global empirical loss minimum of a nonlinear attention layer and to show a crisp positional\u2011to\u2011semantic phase transition as data dimension and sample size scale.",
