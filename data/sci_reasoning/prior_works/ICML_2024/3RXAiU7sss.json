  "synthesis_narrative": "Karl et al.\u2019s central claim\u2014that ML must normalize the publication of negative results and reduce the overemphasis on headline performance\u2014rests on two foundational pillars from broader science and scholarly publishing. Ioannidis\u2019s analysis of publication bias motivates the need to surface null findings, while Chambers\u2019s Registered Reports model provides a concrete, results-agnostic publishing mechanism the authors advocate adapting to ML venues. Within ML, the paper is propelled by critiques that expose how performance-centric incentives distort evidence. Lipton and Steinhardt document troubling scholarship patterns that privilege superficial gains and benchmark narratives; Sculley et al. extend this by detailing the winner\u2019s curse and leaderboard chasing that erode empirical rigor. Empirical demonstrations further sharpen the problem: Recht et al. show that ImageNet gains may not generalize to a fresh test set, making clear that reported SOTA numbers can be misleading. Henderson et al. reveal that RL results hinge on random seeds and protocol choices, underscoring the fragility of single-number performance claims. Finally, Dodge et al. provide actionable reporting practices\u2014multiple runs, variance, and significance tests\u2014that directly inspire the paper\u2019s practical recommendations. Together, these works form the direct intellectual lineage: they diagnose the incentive and methodological failures of performance-only evaluation, supply evidence of its harm, and offer mechanisms that the position paper consolidates into a call to embrace negative results in ML.",
