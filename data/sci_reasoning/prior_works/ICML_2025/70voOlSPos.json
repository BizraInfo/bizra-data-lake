  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014polynomial-delay listing of all MAGs in a Markov equivalence class by recursively introducing singleton background knowledge and applying sound, locally complete orientation rules\u2014stands on a clear lineage. Richardson and Spirtes (2002) established the ancestral-graph framework and PAG representation, while Ali, Richardson, and Spirtes (2009) precisely characterized Markov equivalence for MAGs, defining the invariants a PAG must preserve. These foundations make the MAG-listing problem well-posed.\n\nOn the algorithmic side, the work inherits the classical branch-and-propagate blueprint from the DAG literature. Dor and Tarsi (1992) demonstrated that one can orient a single undecided edge in a PDAG and then close under sound rules to obtain a consistent extension; Andersson, Madigan, and Perlman (1997) and Chickering (2002) cemented the equivalence-class view (via CPDAGs), showing that full classes can be explored by systematically orienting undirected parts. Meek (1995) contributed the crucial paradigm of using background knowledge together with orientation rules to propagate consequences efficiently.\n\nTransferring this template to MAGs requires rule systems that are both sound and strong enough to be locally complete when conditioning on singleton background knowledge. Zhang (2008) provided the foundational rule schema for PAG orientation under latent confounding, which the present work extends: it designs novel locally complete rules tailored to the singleton-BK recursion. This closes the gap between global orientation soundness and the stronger local completeness property needed to guarantee both correctness and polynomial delay in enumerating all MAGs in a PAG\u2019s MEC.",
