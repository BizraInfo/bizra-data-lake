  "synthesis_narrative": "GloptiNets reframes certified non-convex optimization by departing from algebraic SOS/moment methods toward spectral modeling matched to function regularity. The classical foundations of certified bounds are Lasserre\u2019s hierarchy and Parrilo\u2019s SOS/SDP framework, which provide general-purpose certificates but struggle with scalability as the number of coefficients grows. Subsequent work on scaling these ideas\u2014such as sparse SOS (Waki et al.) and LP/SOCP surrogates like DSOS/SDSOS (Ahmadi & Majumdar)\u2014highlights the persistent tightness\u2013tractability tradeoff. In parallel, SAGE relaxations (Murray, Chandrasekaran, Wierman) demonstrated that leaving the SOS paradigm can yield practical, certified alternatives tailored to problem structure. GloptiNets advances this line by constructing certificate families in the Fourier domain, leveraging harmonic analysis facts\u2014codified in Zygmund\u2019s treatment\u2014that smoothness implies fast spectral decay. This justifies truncated spectral models whose approximation error can be controlled and quantified, enabling certified bounds without heavy SDPs. Practical implementability draws on the theory of nonnegative trigonometric polynomials (e.g., Dumitrescu), which connects Fourier coefficients with positive semidefinite Gram structures and spectral factorizations, guiding how to enforce nonnegativity/certification within a trainable model. By casting the search for certificates as neural-network optimization over these spectral models, GloptiNets inherits GPU scalability from deep learning toolchains while maintaining provable guarantees. Collectively, these prior works supply the certification philosophy (SOS/moments), the motivation to seek scalable alternatives (sparse SOS, DSOS/SDSOS, SAGE), and the spectral theory enabling GloptiNets\u2019 Fourier-based certified optimization.",
