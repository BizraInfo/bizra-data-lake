  "synthesis_narrative": "SimWorld synthesizes three major lines of prior work\u2014embodied simulation with realistic physics, scalable environment generation, and LLM/VLM-native social agents\u2014into a single open-ended platform. From AI2-THOR and Habitat, it inherits the principles of interactive, object-centric APIs, fast photorealistic rendering, and standardized large-scale evaluation, while moving beyond navigation and household manipulation to richer, mixed physical-social tasks. TDW contributes a blueprint for faithful, controllable physical dynamics and multi-modal sensing, which SimWorld generalizes under Unreal Engine 5 to support broader task diversity and long-horizon interactions.\nProcTHOR directly motivates SimWorld\u2019s push toward open-ended diversity via procedural generation; SimWorld advances this by making world creation language-driven, enabling semantically rich, on-the-fly scenario synthesis that aligns with natural language specifications. CARLA validates UE\u2019s strengths\u2014high-fidelity physics, multi-agent dynamics, and robust sensor models\u2014informing SimWorld\u2019s engine choice and its multimodal I/O stack for embodied agents.\nFinally, MineDojo and Generative Agents demonstrate how LLM/VLM-driven agents can learn skills in open-ended worlds and participate in socially coherent interactions. SimWorld integrates these ideas natively: agents receive multi-modal observations, act through high-level semantic and low-level controls, and interact under realistic physical and social rules, enabling training and evaluation at the scale and realism needed for agents that must operate\u2014and even sustain themselves economically\u2014in complex real-world-like settings.",
