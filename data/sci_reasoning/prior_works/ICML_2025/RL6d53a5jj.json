Fisher\u2019s foundational work on factorial experiments and randomization defined the design space the authors aim to modernize, while Plackett\u2013Burman\u2019s fractional factorials provided the canonical approach to scaling multifactor experiments when full 2^p designs are infeasible. The present work departs by replacing fixed assignment matrices with a flexible probabilistic scheme that naturally extends to multiple rounds.\n\nOn the optimization side, Kiefer\u2013Wolfowitz\u2019s optimal design criteria and the Bayesian experimental design framework of Chaloner\u2013Verdinelli directly inform how to choose and adapt treatment probabilities to maximize information about model parameters. The paper\u2019s bounded-degree interaction model connects to theory on learning sparse interaction structures: Bien\u2013Taylor\u2013Tibshirani formalize hierarchical sparsity in interactions, while Bresler\u2019s results for bounded-degree Ising models illustrate identifiability and sample-complexity advantages under structural constraints with randomized measurements. Finally, empirical advances in combinatorial CRISPR screening (e.g., Shen et al.) motivate the need for a design that matches lab practice\u2014assigning multiple perturbations per unit with controllable frequencies\u2014while enabling principled, information-efficient optimization and adaptive rounds. Together, these works directly scaffold the paper\u2019s probabilistic design formalism, its optimality objectives, and its structural modeling assumptions.",
