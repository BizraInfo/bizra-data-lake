  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014an analytically solvable RNN whose dynamics collapse to a low-dimensional latent system while producing a population activity manifold with high linear embedding dimension\u2014sits at the intersection of empirical observation, theoretical dimensionality analysis, and solvable RNN constructions. Empirically, Stringer et al. (2019) documented strikingly high-dimensional geometry in mouse V1 population responses, setting the central tension with the widespread low-dimensional latent hypothesis. Conceptually and methodologically, Cunningham and Yu (2014) and Gao et al. (2017) formalized how measured covariance spectra relate to latent dimensionality and highlighted pitfalls: linear eigenspectra can mislead in the presence of nonlinear neuronal responses. The present work leverages precisely these caveats, providing a constructive, solvable counterexample where low-dimensional latents yield high linear embedding dimension, thereby explaining why eigenspectra alone cannot reveal latent dimensionality.\n\nOn the modeling side, the solvable low-rank RNN framework of Mastrogiuseppe and Ostojic (2018) and its geometric elaboration by Dubreuil et al. (2020) supply the analytical tools to reduce high-dimensional recurrent dynamics to a few latent modes while controlling the population geometry. Sussillo and Abbott (2009) established that trained high-dimensional RNNs often implement low-dimensional dynamical primitives, reinforcing the latent-dynamics perspective the current paper renders exactly solvable. Finally, classical continuous-attractor theory in visual cortex (Ben-Yishai et al., 1995) provides an archetype of a one-dimensional latent (bump position on a ring) expressed in a large neural population\u2014an idea generalized here to show how nonlinear tuning can inflate linear embedding dimension even when the underlying dynamics are intrinsically low-dimensional.",
