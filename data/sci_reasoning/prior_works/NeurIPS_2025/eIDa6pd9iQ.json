  "synthesis_narrative": "Auto-Compressing Networks (ACNs) are best understood as a principled rethinking of residual connectivity grounded in three converging strands of prior work. First, ResNets established short skip connections as the dominant deep architecture but also exposed practical depth redundancy. This limitation was sharpened by Veit et al., who argued ResNets behave like ensembles of shallow paths, and by Stochastic Depth, which showed many layers can be dropped with minimal harm\u2014together motivating an architecture that purposefully leverages shallow, early representations rather than relying on ever-deeper stacks. Second, DenseNet and Deep Layer Aggregation demonstrated that extensive inter-layer connectivity and explicit aggregation across depths improves feature reuse and prediction, suggesting that connecting many layers to the output is beneficial if done systematically. Third, Deeply-Supervised Nets and BranchyNet revealed that direct loss signals to intermediate layers strengthen early representations and can support confident predictions, indicating that architectural routes from the classifier to all layers reshape learning dynamics.\nACNs fuse these insights into a simple modification: replace local residual links with direct, additive connections from every layer to the final output. This yields deep supervision by construction, structured aggregation at the head, and training dynamics that concentrate task-relevant information into earlier layers. The resulting \u201cauto-compression\u201d effect\u2014where deeper layers become increasingly redundant during gradient descent\u2014directly addresses the observed shortcomings of very deep residual stacks while retaining the benefits of broad connectivity and strong early-layer representations.",
