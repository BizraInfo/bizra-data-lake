  "synthesis_narrative": "Prismatic Synthesis reframes dataset diversity through the lens of the learner\u2019s own training signal. That move is rooted in a sequence of works establishing gradients as the right unit for reasoning about data\u2019s effect on generalization. Influence Functions and TracIn showed how per-example gradients (and their dot-products along training) connect data to downstream behavior and can be computed at scale, legitimizing gradient-based statistics as practical, model-centric diagnostics. In parallel, the active learning and subset selection literature\u2014BADGE, GLISTER, and Grad-Match\u2014demonstrated that selecting examples to cover the gradient space yields superior generalization compared to surface heuristics; BADGE in particular operationalized diversity directly in gradient embedding space, while GLISTER and Grad-Match tied gradient coverage to validation performance via principled objectives. Dataset Cartography further cemented that training dynamics outperform heuristic text features for dataset curation, shifting the community toward model-induced signals. Finally, theoretical insights from Gradient Diversity linked dispersion of gradients to optimization and generalization, motivating an information-theoretic summary of gradient variability. Building on these strands, the paper\u2019s G-Vendi metric quantifies diversity as the entropy of loss gradients, scaling to million-sample corpora and directly targeting the signal that prior works identified as predictive of generalization. This unifies influence, selection, and diagnostics into a single, scalable diversity measure that outperforms n-gram or embedding heuristics for LLM reasoning OOD generalization.",
