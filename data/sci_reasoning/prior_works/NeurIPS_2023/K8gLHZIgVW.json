  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core insight\u2014that adversarial training in linear regression recovers the minimum-norm interpolating solution (below a critical perturbation radius) and, conversely, that the minimum-norm interpolator solves a suitably tuned adversarial objective\u2014rests on two intertwined lines of prior work: adversarial/robust optimization and overparameterized interpolation.\nGoodfellow et al. and Madry et al. introduced and formalized adversarial training as a min\u2013max optimization over norm-bounded perturbations, giving the precise robust template the authors analyze in the linear setting. Classical robust optimization for least squares (El Ghaoui & Lebret) and its generalizations linking uncertainty sets to regularizers (Xu, Caramanis, Mannor) provide the mathematical mechanism that worst-case feature perturbations induce explicit norm penalties, foreshadowing the equivalences the paper proves. The DRO perspective (Sinha, Namkoong, Duchi) further clarifies how adversarial training admits convex finite-sum formulations and regularization effects in linear models, which the authors exploit to derive exact solution characterizations.\nOn the statistical side, recent analyses of overparameterized regression (Hastie, Montanari, Rosset, Tibshirani) and benign overfitting (Bartlett, Long, Lugosi, Tsigler) establish the centrality and properties of the minimum-norm interpolator. These works make the minimum-norm solution a natural comparator and target, enabling the paper to pinpoint precisely when adversarial training selects it and to interpret the threshold behavior in terms of induced regularization strength. Together, these threads directly enable the paper\u2019s bidirectional equivalence between adversarial training and minimum-norm interpolation in linear regression.",
