  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of \u201cThe Price of Differential Privacy under Continual Observation\u201d is to prove strong lower bounds\u2014showing a ~T^{1/3} multiplicative accuracy gap\u2014between continual release and batch models for fundamental ERM-related problems, and to formalize continual release with adaptively selected inputs. This line begins with Dwork, Naor, Pitassi, and Rothblum, who defined the continual observation setting and introduced the binary-tree mechanism, establishing O(log T) accuracy as the canonical guarantee. Chan, Shi, and Song broadened this toolkit and cemented O(log T) as the prevailing baseline across streaming statistics, implicitly posing whether larger gaps versus batch were inherent for more complex tasks. To quantify a separation, the present work must anchor batch accuracy: Bassily, Smith, and Thakurta\u2019s tight bounds for private ERM, together with geometric lower-bound techniques of Hardt and Talwar, supply the batch-optimal benchmarks and proof ingredients that our results leverage to demonstrate a polynomial gap. A second thrust of the paper is modeling and analyzing adaptively selected inputs\u2014data streams that react to previously released outputs. Here, two threads directly inform the approach: Steinke and Ullman\u2019s interactive fingerprinting codes provide a blueprint for proving lower bounds under adaptivity, and Dwork et al.\u2019s adaptive data analysis framework motivates capturing such dependencies explicitly. Together these works furnish the problem formulation, baselines, and lower-bound machinery that our paper extends to reveal the intrinsic accuracy cost of privacy under continual observation.",
