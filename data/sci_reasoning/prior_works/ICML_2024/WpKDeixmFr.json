  "synthesis_narrative": "Time Weaver\u2019s core contribution\u2014conditional diffusion-based generation of time series using heterogeneous metadata\u2014sits at the confluence of diffusion modeling, temporal conditioning, and mixed-type data handling. The diffusion backbone and training objective come directly from Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, while Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance provides the practical, scalable mechanism for conditioning that Time Weaver adapts to control generation with categorical, continuous, and time-varying metadata. Bringing diffusion into the temporal domain, TimeGrad showed how denoising steps can capture sequential dependencies, and CSDI demonstrated effective injection of time-varying conditioning signals in score-based models; Time Weaver leverages these insights but targets full conditional synthesis rather than forecasting or imputation.\nEarlier conditional time-series generators such as RCGAN and TimeGAN shaped the problem setup\u2014conditioning on exogenous information and evaluating synthetic realism and utility. They also highlighted the limitations of GAN-based approaches in maintaining long-horizon dynamics and conditional consistency, motivating Time Weaver\u2019s move to diffusion and its critique of naive metric transfers (e.g., image-style FID). Finally, TabDDPM\u2019s strategies for diffusion over mixed continuous/categorical variables inform Time Weaver\u2019s representation and denoising of heterogeneous metadata. Together, these works provide the generative scaffolding, conditioning mechanisms, temporal modeling principles, and mixed-type handling that Time Weaver unifies to deliver metadata-aware, conditionally faithful time-series synthesis and improved evaluation suited to the temporal setting.",
