  "synthesis_narrative": "TeT-Splatting emerges at the intersection of radiance fields, signed-distance rendering, splatting, and tetrahedral meshing. NeRF established density-based volumetric rendering as the de facto engine for 3D generation with 2D diffusion priors, but its computational cost and unreliable mesh extraction became clear in downstream works like DreamFusion. VolSDF showed how SDFs can be integrated into a volume-rendering framework, providing surface-aware accumulation that stabilizes geometry learning and improves extractability\u2014a conceptual bridge to TeT-Splatting\u2019s surface-based volumetric rendering. In parallel, 3D Gaussian Splatting demonstrated that rasterization-style splatting can deliver real-time rendering and training, yet its point/ellipsoid primitives lack principled, high-fidelity mesh extraction. Classic Marching Tetrahedra provides a robust mechanism for precise isosurface extraction on tetrahedral grids, a property widely exploited in SDF-based pipelines but often hindered by topology adaptation and optimization instabilities in pure DMTet-style setups. Finally, Instant-NGP underscored that carefully structured, GPU-friendly representations and encodings can unlock orders-of-magnitude speedups for neural fields. TeT-Splatting synthesizes these threads: it adopts a surface-aware (SDF-inspired) volumetric rendering formulation, instantiates it on a structured tetrahedral grid to guarantee accurate mesh extraction via Marching Tetrahedra, and uses splatting to achieve the training and rendering efficiency popularized by 3DGS. The result is a representation that converges easily, renders in real time, and yields precise meshes\u2014directly addressing the core limitations identified by NeRF/DreamFusion and 3DGS.",
