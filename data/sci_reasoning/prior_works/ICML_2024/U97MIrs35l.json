  "synthesis_narrative": "Morph-Tokens are rooted in two converging lines of work: visual prompting for multimodal comprehension and discrete auto-encoding for faithful image generation. On the comprehension side, BLIP-2 crystallized a now-standard recipe\u2014convert images into a handful of query-derived tokens that act as prompts for a frozen LLM. Flamingo similarly compresses visual features into resampled tokens for few-shot reasoning. However, both families produce non-invertible, lossy visual prompts that excel at understanding but cannot serve generation, creating the very conflict Morph-Tokens target. LLaVA further popularized the strong comprehension baseline of mapping vision features into LLM space via instruction tuning, but again without a path to reconstruction. On the generation side, VQ-VAE established the key principle that images can be represented by discrete codebook tokens that are fully reconstructable, and VQGAN elevated the visual quality of such tokenizers. Building on this discrete auto-encoding foundation, large AR generators like Parti demonstrated powerful text-to-image synthesis from image tokens, but did not reconcile the token design needed for both comprehension and generation within an LLM. Morph-Tokens synthesize these threads: they retain the reconstructability of VQ-style tokens for generation while morphing their role to act as effective visual prompts for comprehension, thereby resolving the core objective conflict that prior prompting-only or generation-only tokenizations could not overcome.",
