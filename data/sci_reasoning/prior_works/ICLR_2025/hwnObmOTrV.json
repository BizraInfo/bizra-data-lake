  "synthesis_narrative": "Flow matching established that a neural vector field can be learned by regressing the velocity of a chosen probability path, casting generative modeling as supervised learning on trajectories rather than likelihood maximization. Stochastic interpolants showed that this path can be any smooth, designer-chosen interpolant, decoupling training from a specific diffusion and enabling tailored trajectories whose velocities are easy to compute. Conditional flow matching further introduced conditioning the vector field on auxiliary variables so the learned dynamics reflect side information. In parallel, classifier-free diffusion guidance demonstrated that strong conditioning can be achieved by training with randomly dropped labels and guiding the conditional predictor at inference without an external classifier. On the snapshot-to-dynamics side, TrajectoryNet framed learning continuous-time vector fields from temporal snapshots via dynamic optimal transport, crystallizing the problem of reconstructing trajectories between marginal distributions observed at discrete times. Diffusion Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge provided an alternative, SB-based route to connect given marginals by solving an entropic optimal transport inference problem through score-based diffusion processes.\nTogether, these works exposed a gap: SB and OT formulations struggled to scalably fuse many time points and experimental settings, while flow matching offered a flexible, supervision-style alternative if one could construct appropriate multi-marginal paths and condition robustly. The present work synthesizes these insights by defining smooth spline interpolants across time and conditions (from stochastic interpolants), training a conditional vector field with flow matching (from FM/CFM), and using classifier-free guidance to handle missing time\u2013condition pairs, thereby delivering a practical multi-marginal flow that unifies disparate snapshots and settings.",

Researchers have recently proposed a few methods based either on the Schroedinger Bridge or Flow Matching to tackle this problem, but these approaches remain limited in their ability to effectively combine data from multiple time points and different experimental settings. This integration is essential in real-world scenarios where observations from certain combinations of time points and experimental conditions are missing, either because of experimental costs or sensory failure. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method named Multi-Marginal Flow Matching (MMFM). MMFM first constructs a flow using smooth spline-based interpolation across time points and conditions and regresses it with a neural network using the classifier-free guided Flow Matching framework.
