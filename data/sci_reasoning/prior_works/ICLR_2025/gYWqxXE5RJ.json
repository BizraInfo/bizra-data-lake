  "synthesis_narrative": "ImpScore\u2019s central idea\u2014quantifying implicitness as the divergence between semantic content and pragmatic interpretation\u2014traces directly to foundational pragmatics. Grice\u2019s theory of conversational implicature provides the theoretical basis for treating what is said versus what is meant as separable, while Carston\u2019s explicature\u2013implicature framework sharpens this distinction and directly suggests pairing implicit utterances with explicit counterparts that articulate the communicated content. On the methodological side, the paper stands on the lineage of learned evaluation metrics. BLEURT established that pretrained encoders can be fine-tuned as regressors to yield scalar judgments aligned with human preferences, while COMET (especially its QE, reference-free variants) demonstrated effective training of such metrics using regression/ranking objectives without explicit references. TransQuest further reinforced that sentence-level, reference-free scalar prediction can be reliably learned, guiding ImpScore\u2019s decision to adopt a reference-free, learnable scoring function. The problem impetus comes from persistent gaps in handling implicit content: Abductive Commonsense Reasoning (aNLI) and Social Bias Frames show that current systems struggle with unstated implications and social inferences, yet lack a principled, general-purpose metric to quantify how implicit a sentence is. ImpScore fuses these threads\u2014Gricean/Carston pragmatics with learned, reference-free metric training\u2014to deliver an interpretable, contrastively trained scalar measure of implicitness.",
