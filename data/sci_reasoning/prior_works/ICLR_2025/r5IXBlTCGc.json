  "synthesis_narrative": "De Finetti established the Dutch book criterion, showing that a set of probability assignments is rational only if it precludes a sure-profit bet; this coherence notion precisely characterizes when forecasts are internally consistent. Hanson translated coherence into market design, using cost-function prediction markets to ensure arbitrage-free prices across logically related outcomes, and thus operationalized practical tests for inconsistencies like complementary events not summing to one. Abernethy and colleagues cast such market makers in a convex-optimization framework, quantifying and computing maximum arbitrage when quotes violate constraints\u2014making inconsistency measurable as exploitable profit. On the evaluation side, Gneiting and Raftery formalized strictly proper scoring rules as the normative way to assess probabilistic forecasts, but these inherently require waiting for outcomes to resolve. In NLP, SelfCheckGPT showed that internal agreement among a model\u2019s own outputs can serve as a proxy for correctness without ground truth. Complementarily, CheckList demonstrated how templated, logically related test suites can be programmatically generated to probe specific behavioral properties. Taken together, these strands revealed a gap: forecasting urgently needs instant, outcome-free evaluation, and there exists a principled notion\u2014arbitrage\u2014that both defines inconsistency and can be computed over logically related questions. The paper synthesizes these insights by auto-generating structured forecasting question sets (\u00e0 la CheckList), eliciting probabilistic predictions, and scoring them via the maximum arbitrage implied by de Finetti/Hanson-style coherence, computed with the optimization tools inspired by Abernethy et al., thereby offering a ground-truth-free, quantitative consistency benchmark for LLM forecasters.",

    "abstract": "Forecasting is a task that is difficult to evaluate: the ground truth can only be known in the future. Recent work showing LLM forecasters rapidly approaching human-level performance begs the question: how can we benchmark and evaluate these forecasters *instantaneously*? Following the consistency check framework, we measure the performance of forecasters in terms of the consistency of their predictions on different logically-related questions. We propose a new, general consistency metric based on *arbitrage*: for example, if a forecasting AI illogically predicts that both the Democratic and Republican parties have 60\\% probability of winning the 2024 US presidential election, an arbitrageur could trade against the forecaster's predictions and make a profit. We build an automated evaluation system that generates a set of base questions, instantiates consistency checks from these questions, elicits the predictions of the forecaster, and measures the consistency of the predictions.
