  "synthesis_narrative": "MetaMind\u2019s core innovation\u2014metacognitive multi-agent social reasoning\u2014emerges from three converging lines of prior work. First, multi-agent LLM frameworks such as CAMEL and AutoGen demonstrate that role-specialized agents coordinating via dialogue can outperform monolithic prompting on complex tasks. MetaMind adapts this blueprint by assigning distinct social-reasoning roles (Theory-of-Mind, Moral, Response) and providing a controller that manages iterative, message-based collaboration. Second, metacognitive self-evaluation from Reflexion and principle-guided critique from Constitutional AI directly inspire MetaMind\u2019s refinement loop: the ToM Agent\u2019s hypotheses are explicitly reviewed against normative principles by the Moral Agent, before a final, context-sensitive response is produced and validated\u2014operationalizing metacognition for social understanding rather than purely task accuracy. Third, normative knowledge bases and evaluation traditions\u2014exemplified by Delphi and ETHICS\u2014supply the Moral Agent with culturally grounded norms and clear evaluation axes (e.g., commonsense morality, deontological constraints), ensuring that inferred intentions and responses are aligned with social expectations. Finally, insights from Kosinski\u2019s ToM probing crystallize the need to model mental state inference as a dedicated step, rather than an emergent side effect. Together, these works directly shape MetaMind\u2019s three-stage pipeline and its training/evaluation regime, yielding a system that is both socially perceptive (via explicit ToM) and ethically aligned (via normative critique), with multi-agent coordination providing the scaffolding for reliable, state-of-the-art performance.",
