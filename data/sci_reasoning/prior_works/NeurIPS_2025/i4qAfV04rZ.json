  "synthesis_narrative": "The core idea of jointly modeling low-level image latents with high-level semantic features emerges by synthesizing several threads in generative modeling and representation learning. Latent Diffusion Models established that operating in a VAE latent space yields efficient, high-quality image synthesis, providing the substrate on which this paper layers an additional semantic variable. The reliance on VAE latents follows directly from Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes, which supplies the encoder\u2013decoder interface that LDMs leverage.\n\nArchitecturally, the work adopts the Diffusion Transformer as a scalable denoiser and shows that only minimal modifications are needed to token-encode and co-process two correlated modalities: VAE image latents and semantic features. The semantic side is grounded in self-supervised features from DINO, whose label-free, high-level representations are explicitly co-modeled with the image latents so the model learns a joint distribution over image\u2013feature pairs.\n\nOn the inference side, the paper\u2019s Representation Guidance is conceptually tied to the lineage of diffusion guidance. Classifier guidance demonstrated steering via external semantic gradients, while classifier-free guidance removed the need for an auxiliary classifier. The proposed approach pushes this further by using the jointly learned semantic representations themselves to guide sampling, avoiding auxiliary models and the complexity of distillation schemes such as DreamFusion\u2019s SDS. Together, these influences crystallize into a unified framework that marries generative modeling with representation learning, improving sample quality and efficiency while enabling semantics-aware control without extra teachers or distillation losses.",
