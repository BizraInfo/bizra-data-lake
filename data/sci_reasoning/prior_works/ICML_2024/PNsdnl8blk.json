  "synthesis_narrative": "MAgg\u2019s core idea arises from unifying two lines of thought: test-time augmentation (TTA) and metamorphic testing (MT). TTA methods, typified by Ayhan & Berens, improve robustness by averaging predictions over label\u2011preserving transforms, but their permutation\u2011invariant set aggregation (as formalized by Deep Sets) ignores known dependencies between augmented views and cannot exploit non\u2013label\u2011preserving transformations. Metamorphic testing, synthesized in Segura et al.\u2019s survey and operationalized for DNNs in DeepTest, provides exactly such dependencies: metamorphic relations that specify how outputs should change under structured input transformations even when exact labels are unavailable. MAgg leverages this insight at inference time, modeling metamorphic relations among transformed instances as a directed relation graph and aggregating predictions with message passing, extending Gilmer et al.\u2019s MPNN framework to propagate information according to MR\u2011induced label mappings. This design directly addresses the central gap in standard TTA\u2014its reliance on label preservation and naive averaging\u2014by learning relation\u2011aware aggregation over richer, MR\u2011defined transformation families. The approach is instantiated on canonical ML-for-combinatorial tasks that provided the problem formulations and baselines: SAT satisfiability prediction via NeuroSAT and decision\u2011TSP via Prates et al. MAgg improves inference on these tasks by constructing MR graphs (e.g., literal/constraint transformations for SAT; cost scaling with threshold adjustment for decision\u2011TSP) and learning to aggregate across them, yielding an inference\u2011time augmentation mechanism grounded in metamorphic relations rather than constrained to invariances alone.",
