  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014deriving a temporal-consistency loss for incremental sequence classification\u2014rests on importing the temporal-difference (TD) principle from reinforcement learning into supervised sequence modeling. Sutton\u2019s TD learning established bootstrapping with targets defined by subsequent predictions, while TD Networks extended this to systems where predictions are targets for future predictions. Together with predictive representations of state, these works provide the conceptual mechanism and justification for enforcing self-consistency between adjacent predictions as a sequence unfolds.\nIn parallel, the need for accurate early predictions is grounded in the anytime/early decision literature. SpeedBoost formalized the anytime prediction objective, motivating models whose outputs remain useful under partial computation or partial observation. In NLP, DeeBERT showed that intermediate classifiers can provide early exits for text tasks; however, prior methods largely lacked a principled way to couple those intermediate predictions over time. The present work fills that gap by using a TD-inspired, temporally consistent supervision that ties together successive prefix predictions.\nFinally, consistency-regularization methods such as Mean Teacher empirically validated that constraining predictions across related views improves data efficiency\u2014a theme the paper operationalizes along the temporal dimension with bootstrapped targets. The application to verifying large language model generations builds directly on verifier-based evaluation for math problem solving, where the proposed loss improves early discrimination between promising and unpromising solution prefixes. Overall, these strands converge to yield a theoretically grounded and practically effective loss for incremental sequence classification.",
