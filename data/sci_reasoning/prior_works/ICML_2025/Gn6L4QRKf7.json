  "synthesis_narrative": "This paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014formalizing and analyzing context-enhanced learning as a gradient-based analog of in-context learning (ICL) with provable sample-efficiency gains\u2014stands on two pillars: the ICL literature and retrieval-augmented training. Brown et al. (2020) established ICL as a central capability, while mechanistic studies like Olsson et al. (2022) clarified how transformers implement contextual pattern extraction via induction heads. Von Oswald et al. (2023) further bridged ICL and optimization by showing transformers can enact gradient-descent-like procedures within their activations, motivating the paper\u2019s key insight that adding non-supervised context can sharpen gradient signals during standard training.\n\nOn the methodological side, RAG (Lewis et al., 2020), RETRO (Borgeaud et al., 2022), and ATLAS (Izacard et al., 2022) operationalized training regimes where models ingest rich retrieved context but are supervised only on target outputs. These systems repeatedly reported improved performance and sample efficiency, but lacked a clean theoretical account. The present paper provides that account, proving exponential gains in a simplified multi-step reasoning setting when the model can perform ICL, and attributing the gains to more accurate gradients induced by context.\n\nFinally, the paper\u2019s observation that it is difficult to detect or recover the contextual materials used during training echoes and extends privacy concerns raised by Carlini et al. (2021), highlighting that context-enhanced regimes may complicate provenance and copyright auditing.",
