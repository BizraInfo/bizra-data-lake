  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014efficiently estimating arbitrary contractions of high-order derivative tensors for multivariate functions by constructing input tangents to univariate high-order AD\u2014emerges from the confluence of two lines of prior work. On the AD side, Rall established the truncated power series algebra foundation for higher-order derivatives, while Griewank and Walther systematized Taylor-mode (jet) propagation and seeding rules that enable univariate high-order AD to produce exact higher-order directional derivatives. Pearlmutter\u2019s R-operator demonstrated how contracting derivative tensors with seed vectors (e.g., Jv, Hv) can be executed in time comparable to a gradient, crystallizing the idea that contractions are the computationally tractable objects.\nOn the randomized estimation side, Hutchinson introduced stochastic probing to estimate traces and diagonals without forming matrices, and Avron\u2013Toledo extended this to implicit operators with variance analyses and probe design insights. FFJORD then showcased, in modern deep learning, how Hutchinson combined with AD makes Jacobian-divergence estimation scalable in continuous normalizing flows.\nSTDE unifies these strands by observing that any multilinear contraction of a k-th order derivative tensor equals a k-th order directional derivative along appropriately chosen directions. By encoding those directions as seeds for univariate Taylor-mode AD, STDE avoids the exponential blow-up in k typical of reverse-mode composition while using randomized probes to amortize the polynomial dependence on dimension d. This yields a general, efficient estimator for arbitrary differential operators that extends the Hutchinson+AD paradigm beyond Jacobian traces to high-order operators with principled seeding grounded in Taylor-mode AD.",
