  "synthesis_narrative": "PROM\u2019s core contribution\u2014deriving a probabilistic bridge from label distributions to label rankings under explicit orderliness and monotonicity, while accommodating ties\u2014rests on two converging lines of prior work. From the label-distribution side, Geng\u2019s formulations of label distribution learning (LDL) and label enhancement (LE) established the objective of recovering nuanced label intensities from coarse multi-label annotations, but left open how to rigorously exploit ranking information during enhancement. From the ranking side, classical preference-learning and probabilistic ranking models supplied the missing mathematical tools. The pairwise preference framework of F\u00fcrnkranz and H\u00fcllermeier provided a scalable decomposition for learning inter-label relations, while calibrated label ranking demonstrated that pairwise rankings can be converted into calibrated signals beneficial for multi-label prediction\u2014motivating their use for reconstructing label distributions. At the probabilistic level, the Bradley\u2013Terry model introduced a monotone link between latent scores and pairwise win probabilities, and Davidson\u2019s extension incorporated ties, directly aligning with PROM\u2019s need to map differences (or equality) in label intensities to probabilities of >, =, and < relations. Finally, the Plackett\u2013Luce family grounded an orderly connection between latent utilities and full rankings, reinforcing PROM\u2019s orderliness assumption. Together, these works enabled PROM to formalize a principled, probabilistic, pairwise mechanism that faithfully encodes how label distributions imply ranking relations\u2014complete with monotonicity and tie handling\u2014and to leverage these constraints for more accurate label enhancement.",
