  "synthesis_narrative": "NeoRL\u2019s key idea\u2014optimistic planning under well-calibrated probabilistic models for single-trajectory control\u2014sits at the intersection of average-reward OFU RL, GP-based confidence analysis, and nonepisodic adaptive control. UCRL2 (Jaksch et al., 2010) established the blueprint for nonepisodic regret minimization via optimism in average-reward MDPs, combining confidence sets with optimistic planning; NeoRL adopts this template but targets continuous, nonlinear dynamics. Chowdhury and Gopalan (2017) brought Gaussian process/RKHS tools to RL, showing how GP confidence sets lead to information-gain\u2013scaled regret in continuous spaces; NeoRL extends this kernelized optimism to the control of unknown nonlinear systems without resets. The GP-UCB framework (Srinivas et al., 2010) supplies the core statistical ingredients\u2014\u03b2t-calibrated confidence intervals and the information gain \u0393T\u2014that directly appear in NeoRL\u2019s regret bound O(\u03b2T\u221a(T\u0393T)). On the control side, regret analyses for single-trajectory LQR (Abbasi-Yadkori & Szepesv\u00e1ri, 2011; Dean et al., 2018) demonstrate how estimation uncertainty can be converted into robust/optimistic control policies with provable regret; NeoRL generalizes these ideas beyond linear dynamics to GP-modeled nonlinear systems under continuity and bounded-energy assumptions. Finally, GP-based model-based control methods such as PILCO (Deisenroth & Rasmussen, 2011) provided the practical precedent that GP dynamics yield calibrated uncertainty for planning in continuous control; NeoRL leverages this modeling strength but contributes an optimism-driven exploration mechanism and the first regret guarantees for nonepisodic nonlinear systems with GP dynamics.",
