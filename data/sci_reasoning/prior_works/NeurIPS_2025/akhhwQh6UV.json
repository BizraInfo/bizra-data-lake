  "synthesis_narrative": "TimeWak tackles watermarking for multivariate time series generated by diffusion models that operate in data space, delivering two key advances: a temporal chained-hashing watermark embedded directly in temporal\u2013feature space, and an \u03b5-exact inversion procedure that accounts for non-uniform reconstruction errors across features. Foundationally, DDPM defines the forward\u2013reverse noise process that TimeWak must invert, while DDIM provides deterministic, approximately invertible trajectories that make practical inversion feasible without retracing full stochastic paths. The SDE/ODE formulation of score-based generative modeling further grounds TimeWak\u2019s inversion, enabling principled error control and informing the feature-aware \u03b5 tolerance in detection.\n\nThe need to embed watermarks in data space rather than a homogeneous latent stems from time series diffusion practice: DiffWave demonstrated effective diffusion directly on raw temporal signals, and CSDI extended this to heterogeneous, multivariate time series for imputation, highlighting feature-scale disparities and temporal dependencies that TimeWak explicitly addresses. On the watermarking side, Tree-Ring Watermarks established a diffusion-era paradigm of embedding signals detectable through model inversion; TimeWak generalizes this to time series by abandoning noise/latent-only modulation, introducing temporal chained-hashing to encode cross-step dependencies and provenance in the observable domain. Finally, Lamport\u2019s hash-chain concept directly inspires TimeWak\u2019s sequential binding of watermark components across time, delivering tamper-evident linkage that is robust to temporal structure while remaining detectable under \u03b5-exact, feature-aware diffusion inversion.",
