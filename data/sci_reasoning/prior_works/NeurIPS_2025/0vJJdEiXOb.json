  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014a tight geometric characterization of optimal reconstruction error from approximate distance queries via the Chebyshev radius\u2014sits squarely on the optimal recovery and information-based complexity traditions. Micchelli\u2013Rivlin and the IBC monograph established that, for bounded-noise observations, the minimax error equals the radius of the information-consistent set and is achieved by its Chebyshev center. Milanese\u2013Vicino\u2019s set-membership estimation imported this principle into systems identification, operationalizing Chebyshev centers for bounded-error data. The present work extends and unifies these ideas to the query-driven setting over general (totally bounded) metric spaces, turning distance responses into geometric feasible sets (intersections of annuli/balls) and proving that their Chebyshev radius precisely captures optimal error.\n\nOn the querying side, noisy \u201ctwenty questions\u201d (Jedynak\u2013Frazier\u2013Sisson) and generalized binary search (Nowak) framed target localization and active query design in a learning-theoretic language, highlighting how geometry governs rates. This paper complements those by providing worst-case, metric-space\u2013agnostic guarantees and explicit formulas for Euclidean subsets, rather than Bayesian or discrete hypothesis settings. Finally, the secrecy angle echoes Dinur\u2013Nissim\u2019s reconstruction attacks: approximate answers can leak enough structure to localize targets unless noise is calibrated. The metric-dimension line (Harary\u2013Melter) supplies a combinatorial precursor, showing that distances to landmarks can determine location; here, that intuition is elevated to a continuous, minimax-optimal characterization via the Chebyshev radius.",
