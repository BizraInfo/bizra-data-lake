  "synthesis_narrative": "Path-norms were introduced as scale-invariant measures of complexity for ReLU networks, with Neyshabur et al. showing they yield generalization bounds sharper than weight-operator products on layered architectures while respecting neuron-wise rescaling symmetries. Building on that notion, Path-SGD provided concrete dynamic-programming rules to compute and manipulate path-based quantities efficiently in layered feed-forward networks, cementing the utility and invariance of path-wise formulations for analysis and optimization. In contrast, Bartlett, Foster, and Telgarsky established spectrally-normalized margin bounds based on products of operator norms, a widely used baseline that is often less sharp but broadly applicable. Meanwhile, He et al. introduced residual connections, turning modern networks into general DAGs with skip-add edges that break many layer-wise analyses. In parallel, Anil et al. formalized GroupSort as an order-statistics activation central to Lipschitz-controlled networks, and Goodfellow et al. popularized max-based units (maxout), motivating analyses that treat max pooling and related layers as explicit order-statistics operations. Together these works defined path-wise capacity control, efficient path aggregation, and the modern architectural primitives\u2014residual summation and order-statistics layers\u2014but left a gap: no unified, computable, rescaling-invariant path-norm framework for general DAGs with biases, skips, and order-statistics. The present paper fills this by extending path aggregation beyond layered graphs, embedding order-statistics into the analysis via contraction-style arguments, and delivering generalization bounds that recover or improve prior path-norm results while applying to ResNets and GroupSort/MaxPool networks; as a result, it enables a practical evaluation of path-norm guarantees on large-scale architectures like ImageNet ResNets.",
