  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014tight sublinear data-access bounds for differentially private top-k selection\u2014sits at the intersection of DP selection mechanisms and the top\u2011k access model from classic query processing. The exponential mechanism of McSherry and Talwar is the de facto baseline for private selection; standard implementations score all m candidates, leading to linear access. Building directly on this, the authors prove that EM itself admits O(\u221am) expected accesses and then craft an O(\u221a(mk)) top\u2011k algorithm that retains DP while sharply reducing accesses. The model of random versus sorted access, and the insight that both are needed for sublinear top\u2011k evaluation, trace to Fagin, Lotem, and Naor\u2019s Threshold Algorithm literature; the present work explicitly adopts this model and extends its necessity phenomena to the DP regime via matching lower bounds. On the DP side, Dwork and Roth\u2019s monograph codifies the canonical selection primitives (report\u2011noisy\u2011max, peeling, EM) that this paper treats as baselines and refines in terms of access complexity. Prior practical/top\u2011k\u2011style applications\u2014such as Thakurta and Smith\u2019s differentially private feature selection via EM and threshold\u2011based SVT/AboveThreshold methods (Chan, Shi, Song) and PTR (Dwork, Lei)\u2014all implicitly incur \u03a9(m) scans, exposing a gap: no sublinear\u2011access guarantees for private top\u2011k. The new work directly addresses that gap, showing both how to achieve sublinear accesses by combining random and sorted access and why such a combination is provably necessary.",
