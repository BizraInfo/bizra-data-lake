  "synthesis_narrative": "This paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014gradient-variation online adaptivity that universally interpolates between smooth and non-smooth (H\u00f6lder) regimes and yields accelerated offline optimization via online-to-batch\u2014rests on two intertwined lines of prior work. First, the acceleration and universality foundations: Nesterov\u2019s classical acceleration (1983) provides the target offline rates in smooth settings, while his universal gradient method (2015), together with Devolder\u2013Glineur\u2013Nesterov\u2019s inexact/H\u00f6lder oracle framework (2014), formalizes rate-optimal procedures that adapt across H\u00f6lder smoothness without prior parameter knowledge. These works define the rate landscape that the new method must match after conversion from online to offline.\nSecond, the variation- and optimism-based advances in online convex optimization: Hazan and Kale (2010) established that regret can depend on the temporal variation of losses rather than crude global Lipschitz constants, directly motivating the gradient-variation lens. Rakhlin and Sridharan (2013) introduced optimistic mirror descent for predictable sequences, yielding regret tuned to path-length and gradient prediction error\u2014precisely the mechanism enabling smooth-to-nonsmooth interpolation without knowing the H\u00f6lder parameter. Krichene, Bayen, and Bartlett (2015) further connected optimism to accelerated dynamics, cementing the conceptual bridge from online adaptivity to offline acceleration. Building on these, the paper designs a H\u00f6lder-aware, parameter-free optimistic algorithm whose regret scales with gradient variation in a way that seamlessly transitions between regimes; via standard online-to-batch conversion, this yields an optimal universal method for stochastic optimization that recovers accelerated rates whenever the data exhibit H\u00f6lder-type smoothness.",
