  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper targets the core theoretical gaps in softmax-gated Gaussian mixture-of-experts (MoE): identifiability under the softmax\u2019s translation invariance, intricate coupling between gating and experts, and the complex numerator\u2013denominator dependence in conditional densities. The MoE framework and softmax gating architecture trace directly to Jacobs et al. (1991) and Jordan & Jacobs (1994), which defined the probabilistic structure and EM training that make these issues salient. Early theoretical treatments of MoE by Jiang & Tanner (1999) raised identifiability and inferential questions in covariate-dependent mixtures, setting the stage for a rigorous analysis of softmax-specific non-identifiability tackled here.\n\nOn the inferential side, Chen (1995) established how singularities in finite mixtures drive nonstandard MLE rates, while Teicher (1963) provided identifiability foundations; this paper extends both to the covariate-dependent, softmax-gated setting, introducing a Voronoi loss that organizes local Taylor/PDE expansions componentwise and neutralizes cross-component interference introduced by the gating network. The authors\u2019 over-specification results mirror the mixture literature\u2019s understanding of overfitting\u2014epitomized by Rousseau & Mengersen (2011)\u2014but adapted to the softmax-gated regression context.\n\nFinally, the connection the authors draw between MLE convergence rates and solvability of polynomial systems reflects Watanabe\u2019s (2009) singular learning perspective: algebraic structure dictates asymptotics. By importing this algebraic lens into softmax-gated MoE and pairing it with a bespoke Voronoi loss, the paper resolves long-standing obstacles in parameter estimation for Gaussian MoE with softmax gating and delivers precise convergence guarantees even under over-specification.",
