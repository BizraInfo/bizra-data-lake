  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014a general theory that equates size transferability with continuity in a task-driven limit space\u2014sits at the intersection of permutation invariance/equivariance and graph/measure limit theory. Deep Sets and PointNet introduced practical, dimension-independent architectures for sets and point clouds, demonstrating that global aggregations can yield permutation invariance across variable cardinalities. However, subsequent experience showed that such models may fail to extrapolate reliably as input size grows. Message-passing GNNs extended dimension independence to graphs, but lacked general guarantees for transferring from small to large graphs.\n\nTwo lines of prior theory directly motivate the authors\u2019 solution. First, Levie et al. formalized size transferability for spectral GNNs via stability of spectral filters, hinting that transfer is a continuity property relative to an appropriate notion of graph convergence. Second, Lov\u00e1sz\u2019s graph limit framework provides the mathematical language to identify small and large instances through equivalence classes (graphons and related limits), supplying the limit space on which continuity can be defined. In parallel, operator-learning works like the Fourier Neural Operator showed, in PDE settings, that learning continuous operators enables resolution transfer, reinforcing continuity as the transferable property. Finally, theory on invariant/equivariant architectures (Maron et al.) clarifies the structural constraints models must satisfy; the present paper augments these with continuity in the limit space and operationalizes them across existing architectures.\n\nTogether, these works converge on the insight that size generalization emerges when architectures implement continuous operators on an appropriate limit object. The paper unifies and extends these ideas, prescribes concrete architectural adjustments to enforce continuity, and validates the theory across sets, graphs, and point clouds.",
