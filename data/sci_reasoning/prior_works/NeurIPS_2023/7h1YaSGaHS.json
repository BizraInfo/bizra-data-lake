  "synthesis_narrative": "GEESE\u2019s core idea\u2014detecting and correcting failed inverse estimates by leveraging a physics-based simulator error, then refining solutions efficiently\u2014sits at the intersection of physics-guided learning, surrogate modeling, and generative search. Physics-Informed Neural Networks crystallized the principle that physics residuals can act as meaningful training and validation signals, which GEESE repurposes to flag failure cases and define the correction objective. To make repeated simulator feedback tractable, GEESE borrows from Bayesian optimization\u2019s use of surrogates for expensive objectives, adopting a hybrid surrogate error model that reduces simulation calls while allowing gradient-based backpropagation. Its search mechanism draws on distribution-based optimization: the Cross-Entropy Method\u2019s elite-driven adaptation motivates representing and updating candidate distributions, while simulation-based inference via neural density estimators (SNPE) demonstrates how flexible generative models can approximate posteriors over states from simulator data. Closely aligned with GEESE\u2019s two-generator design, Conditioning by Adaptive Sampling shows how oracle thresholds can focus a generator on high-performing regions without collapsing exploration. Finally, optimization-based inverse correction under a forward model, as in generative compressed sensing and classic 4D-Var data assimilation, anchors GEESE\u2019s gradient-driven refinement using a physics-derived misfit. Together, these strands directly inform GEESE\u2019s three pillars: physics-error detection, surrogate-enabled correction, and dual generative distributions that balance exploitation with exploration.",
