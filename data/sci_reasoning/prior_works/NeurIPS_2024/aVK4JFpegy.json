  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014evaluating whether a generative model recovers a coherent world model by testing its latent state partition against minimal DFA structure\u2014stands on two intertwined threads. First, the automata-theoretic backbone comes from the Myhill\u2013Nerode theorem (Myhill; Nerode), which characterizes regular languages via indistinguishability classes and minimal automata. This lens naturally yields evaluation criteria: if a model has the right world model, its behavior should honor the same equivalence classes and be separable by the same distinguishing suffixes. Angluin\u2019s L* algorithm operationalizes these ideas through membership/counterexample queries using distinguishing strings, while RPNI shows how minimal DFAs can be recovered passively from samples\u2014both directly informing how to probe and reconstruct the model\u2019s implied state partition from observed generations. Complementing this, work on equivalence and minimization in MDPs (Givan, Dean, Greig) provides a behavioral abstraction perspective\u2014bisimulation-like equivalence\u2014that aligns with Myhill\u2013Nerode in the deterministic setting the paper studies. The second thread is the ML motivation: Ha and Schmidhuber\u2019s World Models popularized the goal of learning internal environment dynamics, and subsequent benchmarks like SCAN revealed that models often appear competent yet fail systematic generalization. The present paper unifies these strands, proposing automata-theoretic metrics that transcend surface diagnostics to expose incoherent latent state structure in generative models across games, logic, and navigation, and explaining the fragility observed on subtly varied tasks.",
