  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014architecturally embedding rotation- and scale-equivariant convolutions into CNNs to enhance adversarial robustness\u2014sits at the intersection of adversarial defense and symmetry-aware deep learning. Goodfellow et al. exposed the fundamental brittleness of CNNs to small perturbations, while Madry et al. established adversarial training with PGD as the prevailing defense, and TRADES formalized the inherent robustness\u2013accuracy tension and heavy computational burden. These works motivate a defense that does not rely solely on expensive adversarial objectives.\nOn the architectural side, Cohen and Welling\u2019s Group Equivariant CNNs introduced the central mechanism of group-equivariant convolutions, later generalized by Steerable CNNs to continuous groups via steerable filter parameterizations. Weiler and Cesa extended this framework to scale, enabling principled scale-equivariant feature extraction. Together, these symmetry tools provide exactly the rotation- and scale-aware layers the present paper integrates into standard CNNs via parallel and cascaded designs.\nThe theoretical rationale for robustness gains through equivariance is supported by Bruna and Mallat\u2019s scattering theory, which proves stability to deformations and links symmetry priors to smoother, more Lipschitz decision boundaries. In combination, these prior works directly inform both the paper\u2019s methodology (how to build and integrate equivariant layers) and its thesis (why symmetry priors can mitigate adversarial vulnerability), yielding an architectural pathway to robustness that complements rather than replaces adversarial training.",
