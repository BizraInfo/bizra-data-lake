  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014achieving sublinear regret in online Bayesian persuasion when both the prior and the receiver\u2019s utilities are unknown\u2014rests on unifying foundations from information design with online learning under incentives. Kamenica and Gentzkow (2011) supplies the base persuasion model, defining signaling schemes as distributions over posterior beliefs and characterizing optimal persuasion via concavification and receiver best responses. Blackwell\u2019s classic theory formalizes information structures as distributions over posteriors subject to Bayes plausibility; this is crucial for the paper\u2019s non-standard representation that makes searching the space of schemes feasible even without prior knowledge. Dughmi and Xu (2016) contribute algorithmic representations (e.g., signatures/reduced forms) and optimization tools that inspire how the present work parameterizes and searches over signaling schemes.\n\nOn the online side, Bayesian Exploration (Mansour et al., 2020) shows how a principal can learn while respecting incentive constraints for a stream of myopic agents, offering techniques and regret benchmarks for exploration-exploitation with strategic responses. The most immediate precursors are the authors\u2019 own online persuasion studies that handle only one unknown at a time: learning receiver utilities with a known prior, and learning the prior with known utilities. The present paper synthesizes these strands, designing a scheme-search procedure that simultaneously elicits receiver best responses and navigates Bayes-plausible posteriors without prior knowledge, and establishing tight lower bounds that match the achieved regret guarantees.",
