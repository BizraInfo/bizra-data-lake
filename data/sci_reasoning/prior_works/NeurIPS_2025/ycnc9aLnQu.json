  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of this paper is to open the black box of Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) models via probing, and to introduce Coefficient Significance Probing (CS-Probing) for statistically grounded interpretability. This builds on two intertwined intellectual lineages. First, foundational NCO works\u2014Bello et al. inaugurating neural policies for combinatorial optimization and Nazari et al. formulating the VRP within this paradigm\u2014established the policy-construction setting and model classes our study interrogates. Among these, Kool et al.\u2019s attention-based model and Kwon et al.\u2019s POMO are the primary contemporary baselines whose encoder/decoder representations we directly probe, enabling us to attribute differences in inductive bias and information encoding to concrete architectural and training choices.\nSecond, our methodology stands on the probing literature. Alain & Bengio introduced linear classifier probes as a means to read out information from intermediate representations; we adopt this readout mechanism but extend it with a principled statistical layer. Specifically, critiques by Hewitt & Liang and Pimentel et al. demonstrated that raw probe accuracy can conflate probe capacity with representational content, urging more rigorous interpretability criteria. CS-Probing operationalizes this by examining probe coefficients and their statistical significance, shifting emphasis from mere prediction to which features of the representation reliably encode task-relevant signals. In synthesizing these lines, our work provides the first systematic, statistically grounded probing of NCO models, revealing both low-level construction cues and high-level decision knowledge encoded by leading VRP policies.",
