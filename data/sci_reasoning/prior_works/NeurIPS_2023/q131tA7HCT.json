  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s central advance\u2014identifying linear causal representations from non-paired, unknown single-node interventions under completely general nonlinear mixing\u2014sits at the intersection of identifiable representation learning, interventional causal discovery, and multi-environment signal separation. Nonlinear ICA with auxiliary variables (Hyv\u00e4rinen & Morioka) and its likelihood-based incarnation (iVAE) established that distributional changes across environments can unlock identifiability despite nonlinear mixing; this work adopts that lens but dispenses with invertibility and explicit auxiliary labels by exploiting interventional environments. The core technical device is inspired by classic second-order blind identification (Pham & Cardoso), where multiple condition-specific covariances enable joint diagonalization to recover sources. Here, the authors uncover analogous high-dimensional geometric invariants: quadratic forms of precision matrices of latent Gaussians retain identifiable signatures even after arbitrary nonlinear pushforwards, enabling recovery of latent axes impacted by single-node interventions.\nComplementing this, principles from causal discovery under interventions (Hauser & B\u00fchlmann) and invariant causal prediction (Peters et al.) guide how interventions reshape Gaussian precision structure and how invariances/changes across environments can be harnessed for causal identification. Independent Mechanism Analysis (Gresele et al.) further motivates the assumption that mechanisms vary independently across environments\u2014instantiated here as unknown single-node interventions\u2014yielding separable signals for alignment. Finally, the impossibility of unsupervised disentanglement without auxiliary information (Locatello et al.) frames the contribution: the paper pinpoints minimally supervised interventional heterogeneity as sufficient for identifiability and translates it into a practical contrastive algorithm for deep embeddings without requiring paired counterfactuals or known targets.",
