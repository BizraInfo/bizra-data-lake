  "synthesis_narrative": "This paper sits at the intersection of margin-based implicit bias, hinge-loss geometry, and the modern view of interpolation with label noise. The implicit bias results of Soudry et al. established that gradient descent on separable data converges to a max-margin direction; Lyu and Li extended this to homogeneous (ReLU) networks, legitimizing a margin-centric analysis for two-layer ReLU classifiers. Building on hinge loss\u2019s subgradient structure, as operationalized in Pegasos, the authors leverage the fact that only margin-violating examples generate updates: once clean points exceed the margin, they essentially stop contributing, leaving corrupted points to drive later dynamics. This mechanistic insight underpins the paper\u2019s two-phase training description and the conditions separating three regimes: benign overfitting, harmful overfitting, and non-overfitting.\n\nThe broader context from Belkin et al.\u2019s double descent and Bartlett et al.\u2019s theory of benign overfitting motivates asking when interpolation with noise can still generalize. Their results inspire the present work\u2019s clean-margin thresholds that certify benign generalization despite zero training loss on corrupt labels. Finally, empirical observations from Zhang et al. and Arpit et al. on memorization and the \u2018simple-first, noise-later\u2019 dynamic align with\u2014and are theoretically explained by\u2014the paper\u2019s neuron-level trajectory analysis under hinge loss. Together, these prior works directly inform the paper\u2019s core contribution: a sharp, margin-driven characterization of when overfitting in shallow ReLU networks trained with hinge loss is benign, harmful, or avoided, along with a fine-grained account of the training dynamics that produce these outcomes.",
