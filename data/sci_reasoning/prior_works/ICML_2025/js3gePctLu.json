  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core idea is to maximize a procurement buyer\u2019s net utility\u2014submodular quality minus sellers\u2019 costs\u2014while ensuring DSIC, IR for sellers and a non-deficit guarantee for the buyer, and to do so through approximation-preserving reductions from submodular optimization algorithms. The mechanism-design backbone is Archer\u2013Tardos\u2019 characterization for single-parameter agents, which the authors use to convert monotone allocation rules into truthful mechanisms with threshold payments. The procurement-with-submodular-valuation paradigm and the black-box reduction ethos trace directly to Singer\u2019s budget-feasible mechanisms; however, prior work optimized value subject to a payment budget. Chen\u2013Gravin\u2013Lu advanced that line but still operated under exogenous budget constraints, leaving open mechanisms that directly target the profit objective v(S) \u2212 \u2211c_i with a non-deficit guarantee. This paper fills that gap by providing approximation-preserving transformations that ensure IC/IR/NAS for the profit objective. On the optimization side, the relevant objective is a submodular-minus-modular function, a special case of difference-of-submodular (DS) objectives formalized by Iyer\u2013Bilmes; the authors contribute an improved analysis for maximizing such potentially non-positive submodular functions. Concretely, they sharpen guarantees for the double-greedy algorithm of Buchbinder\u2013Feldman\u2013Naor\u2013Schwartz in this regime, which becomes the optimization workhorse inside their mechanisms. Their framework is general and can also wrap other non-monotone submodular optimizers in the spirit of the Lee\u2013Sviridenko\u2013Vondr\u00e1k toolkit, thereby linking advances in submodular maximization directly to incentive-compatible, non-deficit procurement auctions.",
