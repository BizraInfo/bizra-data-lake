  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core idea\u2014modeling neuron\u2013neuron interaction with a Riemannian metric in a neuronal state space\u2014arises at the intersection of dynamical systems views of deep networks and manifold-based representation learning. Foundationally, Neural ODEs (Chen et al.) and the stability analysis linking ResNets to ODE discretizations (Haber et al.) recast deep networks as continuous-time dynamical systems, directly enabling the authors to treat neural computation as evolving interactions amenable to geometric redesign. On the representation side, Poincar\u00e9 Embeddings (Nickel et al.) and Hyperbolic Neural Networks (Ganea et al.) showed that Riemannian geometry can yield compact, expressive models by operating in non-Euclidean spaces with Riemannian operations; the present work internalizes this insight by projecting neuron states onto a Riemannian manifold and using the metric tensor itself to govern interactions, thereby increasing nonlinearity and parameter efficiency beyond standard weight-plus-activation formulations. The compression mechanism is situated within data-free model reduction: DFQ (Nagel et al.) and ZeroQ (Cai et al.) define the dominant no-data post-training quantization baselines, often relying on calibration heuristics or BatchNorm statistics, while DeepInversion (Yin et al.) synthesizes surrogate data to make such pipelines work. The proposed method targets the same setting yet removes the dependency on real or synthetic data by compressing at the representational level through Riemannian neural dynamics, addressing the limitations of calibration- or synthesis-based approaches.",
