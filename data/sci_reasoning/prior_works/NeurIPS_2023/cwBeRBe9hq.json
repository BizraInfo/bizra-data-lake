  "synthesis_narrative": "The NeurIPS 2023 paper tackles the foundational question of when multilabel ranking is learnable from relevance-score feedback, both in batch and online regimes, and unifies commonly used losses into two learnability-equivalence classes. This advances a trajectory initiated by Elisseeff and Weston, who crystallized multilabel ranking and pairwise ranking losses as core objectives. Building the statistical bedrock, Cl\u00e9men\u00e7on\u2013Lugosi\u2013Vayatis analyzed pairwise ranking via U-statistics and ERM, offering generalization tools that the new paper elevates to tight learnability characterizations across a broad loss family.\nGao and Zhou\u2019s reduction of multilabel ranking to univariate proper-loss minimization directly informs one of the equivalence classes identified: losses that are learnable via label-wise probability estimation under relevance-score feedback. Narasimhan and Agarwal\u2019s strongly proper loss theory further cements the link between probability estimation and ranking regret, clarifying when surrogates faithfully capture target ranking risks. The calibration framework of Tewari and Bartlett, developed for multiclass classification, provides the lens for grouping losses by learnability rather than surface form\u2014yielding the paper\u2019s two equivalence classes that encompass most practical ranking losses.\nFor the online setting, the work channels the dimension-based perspective of Ben-David\u2013P\u00e1l\u2013Shalev-Shwartz and the sequential complexity machinery of Rakhlin\u2013Sridharan\u2013Tewari to obtain necessary and sufficient conditions in adversarial environments with relevance-score feedback. Together, these prior strands converge to a comprehensive learnability theory that both delineates the feasible space of multilabel ranking and organizes ranking losses by their fundamental statistical difficulty.",
