  "synthesis_narrative": "Multi-set CCA defined how to maximize correlations across more than two views, providing the core linear criterion for multi-view fusion. Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis showed that such correlation objectives can be optimized end-to-end with deep nonlinear mappings, establishing practical training procedures for correlation-based alignment. Hardoon and colleagues clarified that performing CCA with one-hot labels recovers Fisher\u2019s discriminative directions, pinpointing an analytic bridge between correlation objectives and supervised LDA. In parallel, SwAV demonstrated that reliable clusters can emerge by enforcing agreement of codes across augmented views, translating cross-view consistency into a supervisory signal. Barlow Twins refined correlation-driven self-supervision by matching cross-correlation matrices to reduce redundancy and align features without negatives, highlighting the power of correlation objectives for robust representation learning. Co-regularized multi-view spectral clustering earlier formalized the idea that multi-view methods should explicitly enforce agreement of clusterings across views, foreshadowing modern cross-view consistency strategies. DeepCluster, while impactful, revealed the inefficiencies and instability of two-stage pipelines alternating feature learning and k-means.\nTogether these works suggested a path: use CCA\u2019s multi-view correlation principle (and its LDA connection) but implement it with deep nonlinear mappings and cross-view agreement to produce clusters directly. COPER synthesizes these threads by introducing a permutation-based canonical correlation loss that operationalizes multi-view alignment while simultaneously discovering clusters via cross-view pseudo-label consistency, thereby unifying representation learning and clustering with theoretical guarantees tied to LDA.",

However, most of the current multi-view clustering methods are limited to specific domains or rely on a suboptimal and computationally intensive two-stage process of representation learning and clustering. We propose an end-to-end deep learning-based multi-view clustering framework for general data types (such as images and tables). Our approach involves generating meaningful fused representations using a novel permutation-based canonical correlation objective. We provide a theoretical analysis showing how the learned embeddings approximate those obtained by supervised linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Cluster assignments are learned by identifying consistent pseudo-labels across multiple views. Additionally, we establish a theoretical bound on the error caused by incorrect pseudo-labels in the unsupervised representations compared to LDA.
