  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014showing that planning corresponds exactly to a distinct set of entropy weights within a variational free-energy and deriving a loopy-BP analogue for planning\u2014sits at the intersection of two lines of work. First, the control-as-inference lineage (Attias; Toussaint; Kappen; Todorov) reframed planning as probabilistic inference by introducing optimality variables and entropy-regularized control objectives. Kappen\u2019s path-integral perspective and Todorov\u2019s linearly-solvable MDPs made explicit the role of temperature and KL/entropy terms in control, while Toussaint demonstrated that message passing and variational approximations can compute trajectories and policies under this view. Second, the variational inference literature (Yedidia; Liu & Ihler) established that inference algorithms, including BP and its generalizations, minimize free-energy functionals composed of energy and entropy terms, and that altering the entropy weights yields different inference problems, such as marginal-MAP, with corresponding message-passing updates.\nBy synthesizing these strands, the paper pinpoints the precise entropy weighting that makes \"planning\" just another variational inference problem, rather than an approximate or heuristic analogy. This recognition unlocks the full toolbox of variational inference for planning. Grounded in Yedidia\u2019s free-energy perspective and inspired by loopy BP (Murphy, Weiss, Jordan), the authors derive a BP-like algorithm specifically tuned to the planning free energy, enabling approximate planning in factored-state MDPs without succumbing to exponential blowup. The result is a principled, unified view that clarifies inconsistencies in prior planning-as-inference formulations and delivers a practical message-passing planner backed by variational theory.",
