  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s contribution\u2014provably characterizing when and why annealing improves estimation of normalizing constants and clarifying the efficiency hierarchy between NCE and importance sampling\u2014rests on three intertwined lines of prior work. First, Neal\u2019s annealed importance sampling established the core idea of traversing a sequence of intermediate distributions to estimate partition functions, providing the baseline estimator and design knobs (step size, schedule) that the present work rigorously analyzes. Second, the discriminative perspective inaugurated by Gutmann and Hyv\u00e4rinen\u2019s noise-contrastive estimation reframed normalizer estimation as a classification problem; earlier roots in Bennett\u2019s acceptance ratio and Geyer\u2019s reverse logistic regression showed that logistic/bridge-based estimators can be statistically superior to naive IS. These works directly foreshadow the paper\u2019s result that NCE is asymptotically more efficient than IS (and that their gap vanishes with infinitesimal steps). Third, the path-design literature\u2014bridge sampling (Meng & Wong), path/thermodynamic integration (Gelman & Meng), and power posteriors (Friel & Pettitt)\u2014made explicit that the choice of intermediate distributions is critical. Building on this, the paper proves that the geometric (power) path is not merely convenient but can reduce error scaling from exponential to polynomial, giving a principled answer to which path one should use. Together, these strands enable a unified asymptotic error analysis that compares estimators, clarifies the role of annealing, and identifies provably good paths.",
