  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014an unbiased yet lower-variance surrogate loss (Nash Advantage Loss, NAL) for approximating Nash equilibria via stochastic optimization\u2014sits at the intersection of classical NE gap functions and modern variance-reduction techniques for stochastic gradients. At its core, NAL inherits the target from the Nikaid\u014d\u2013Isoda gap, the canonical \u201cdistance-to-NE\u201d merit function that sums each player\u2019s unilateral deviation advantage. In machine learning practice, this idea was instantiated as NashConv (Lanctot et al.), which is computable via Monte Carlo from sampled play and remains unbiased, but typically exhibits high variance that slows convergence.\n\nTo address this, the authors import the advantage/baseline paradigm from policy-gradient methods. REINFORCE (Williams) and the policy-gradient theorem (Sutton et al.) establish that subtracting an appropriate baseline preserves unbiasedness while reducing estimator variance\u2014precisely the lever NAL applies by centering the NE gap with player-wise advantage terms. Practical refinements from NVIL (Mnih & Gregor) and GAE (Schulman et al.) further motivate control-variates and advantage-style constructions that systematically lower variance without biasing gradients.\n\nFinally, the broader shift toward differentiable, gradient-based game learning (Balduzzi et al.) contextualizes why a carefully engineered loss matters: non-convex, multi-agent dynamics are sensitive to estimator noise. NAL thus emerges as a principled synthesis\u2014retaining the unbiased NE-gap objective (NI/NashConv) while embedding variance-reduction mechanisms from stochastic gradient theory to accelerate convergence in normal-form games.",
