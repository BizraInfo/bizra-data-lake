  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution is a unified view of concept-based explanations that (i) casts automatic concept extraction as dictionary learning and (ii) reframes concept importance estimation as an attribution problem. Two lines of prior work directly enable this unification. First, concept-centric methods like TCAV and ACE established the prevailing two-step pipeline: discover concepts and then quantify their influence. TCAV provided the first principled mechanism for measuring concept importance via directional derivatives of concept activation vectors, while ACE demonstrated automatic discovery of concepts with a practical pipeline that coupled clustering-based extraction with TCAV-based scoring. Second, foundational attribution research\u2014Integrated Gradients and SHAP\u2014introduced axiomatic, model-agnostic paradigms for assigning importance that the paper elevates to the concept level, thereby generalizing beyond TCAV to a broader family of attributions and associated evaluation criteria. Complementing these, Grad-CAM exemplifies gradient-based attribution widely used in vision, reinforcing the paper\u2019s argument that concept importance should be treated within the attribution toolbox.\nOn the extraction side, recasting concept discovery as dictionary learning roots the problem in a mature optimization framework exemplified by K-SVD, clarifying objectives (reconstruction, sparsity) and enabling systematic comparisons across methods. Finally, Network Dissection contributed quantitative metrics for aligning internal representations with human concepts, informing the paper\u2019s proposals for standardized evaluation of concept extraction quality. Together, these works directly shape the paper\u2019s holistic framework and its new metrics for fair, extensible evaluation of concept-based explanations.",
