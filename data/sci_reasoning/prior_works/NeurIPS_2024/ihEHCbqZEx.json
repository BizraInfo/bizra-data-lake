  "synthesis_narrative": "Flex-MoE\u2019s core contribution\u2014robust modeling of arbitrary modality combinations through a missing-modality bank followed by a modality-aware Sparse MoE\u2014sits at the intersection of two influential threads: principled handling of missing modalities and scalable sparse expert routing. On the missing-modality side, MVAE\u2019s product-of-experts and MoPoE-VAE\u2019s generalized ELBO formalize learning from any subset of modalities, establishing that models should natively support combinatorial subsets rather than rely on complete data. ModDrop operationalized robustness by dropping modalities during training, while GMU introduced gating to adaptively weight modalities. Flex-MoE synthesizes these ideas by replacing stochastic or purely feature-level fusion with a structured missing-modality bank that explicitly enumerates and links observed subsets to their complementary missing configurations, ensuring systematic coverage during training.\nOn the scaling/compute side, the sparsely gated MoE of Shazeer et al. provides the backbone for conditional computation and load balancing, and Switch Transformers demonstrate how simplified, efficient routing can scale expert models. Inspired by MMoE, Flex-MoE decouples gating from experts so that different modality subsets can share experts while using distinct gates. The result is a flexible expert pool whose routing is conditioned on modality availability, combining principled subset coverage (from PoE/MoPoE) with efficient sparse computation (from MoE/Switch) and modality-aware gating (from GMU/MMoE). This integration directly enables Flex-MoE\u2019s key capability: high performance across arbitrary modality combinations with resilience to missing data.",
