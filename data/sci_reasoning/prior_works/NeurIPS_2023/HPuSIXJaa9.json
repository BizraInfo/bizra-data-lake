  "synthesis_narrative": "DPO\u2019s core contribution is to eliminate reward modeling and reinforcement learning from the RLHF pipeline by exploiting a closed-form relationship between rewards and the optimal KL-regularized policy, turning preference learning into direct policy training. The starting point is preference-based RL (Christiano et al., 2017), which established collecting pairwise human comparisons, training a reward model with a Bradley\u2013Terry likelihood, and then optimizing a policy against that reward. For language models, Ziegler et al. (2019) and Stiennon et al. (2020) cast this as maximizing expected reward while penalizing KL divergence from a reference LM, typically optimized with PPO, and using the Bradley\u2013Terry/logistic preference model.\nThe theoretical lever enabling DPO comes from the Boltzmann-form optimality of KL/entropy-regularized control: REPS (Peters et al., 2010) and MaxEnt IRL (Ziebart et al., 2008) show that the optimal policy under a KL or entropy regularizer is proportional to the reference policy times the exponential of a scaled reward. This yields an invertible mapping between reward and policy log-ratios. RAML (Norouzi et al., 2016) further demonstrated that one can train models by supervised learning to match reward-exponentiated target distributions rather than performing RL.\nDPO synthesizes these strands by substituting the reward\u2013policy mapping into the Bradley\u2013Terry preference likelihood used in RLHF. This yields a simple logistic classification loss on policy log-likelihood ratios relative to a reference model, optimizing the same KL-regularized objective targeted by PPO-based RLHF but in a single-stage, stable, supervised procedure.",
