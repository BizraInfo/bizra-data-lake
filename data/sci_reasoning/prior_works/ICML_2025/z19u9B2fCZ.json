  "synthesis_narrative": "CSR\u2019s core idea\u2014turning fixed dense embeddings into high-dimensional, selectively activated codes that can be adaptively truncated via sparsity\u2014sits at the intersection of three lines of work. First, adaptive/nested representations from Nested Dropout and Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) establish the desiderata: a single embedding that supports variable computational budgets. MRL is the immediate baseline CSR targets; its limitations (full retraining and degraded short-length performance) directly motivate CSR\u2019s sparsity-based alternative to ordering dimensions.\nSecond, classical sparse coding provides the mechanism. Olshausen and Field\u2019s overcomplete sparse representations and Mairal et al.\u2019s scalable dictionary learning furnish the principles and algorithms for mapping dense features into compact, selective codes. k-Sparse Autoencoders show that explicitly controlling the number of active units yields robust, interpretable, and budget-adjustable representations\u2014precisely the knob CSR uses to trade cost for fidelity at inference.\nThird, contrastive learning ensures semantic preservation. InfoNCE-style objectives (CPC) structure representation spaces to maintain discriminative relationships under transformations, while CLIP demonstrates the power of contrastive supervision for retrieval and multimodal alignment. CSR leverages a lightweight autoencoding pathway to specify pre-trained embeddings into a sparse space, then applies task-aware contrastive objectives so that sparsity does not erode semantic quality. By synthesizing these strands, CSR delivers adaptive, high-fidelity representations without end-to-end retraining, outperforming MRL across image, text, and multimodal settings.",
