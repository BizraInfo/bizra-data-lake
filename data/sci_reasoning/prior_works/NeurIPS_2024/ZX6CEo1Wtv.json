  "synthesis_narrative": "LDNS\u2019s core innovation\u2014high-fidelity, behavior-conditional generation of realistic neural spike trains by performing diffusion in a learned low-dimensional latent space\u2014arises from the confluence of two traditions. First, latent dynamical models in neuroscience (GPFA; LFADS) established that population spiking activity is well explained by smooth, low-dimensional trajectories aligned in time and often predictive of behavior. These works shaped LDNS\u2019s decision to infer continuous, time-aligned latents from discrete spike trains and to target behavior-conditioned generation in that latent domain. Second, modern diffusion/score-based generative modeling (DDPM; score-based SDE) provides a powerful, stable training objective and sampling framework capable of capturing rich higher-order statistics that VAEs often miss. Building on Latent Diffusion Models, LDNS moves the diffusion process into the latent space learned by an autoencoder, thereby sidestepping discrete spike modeling while preserving the structure necessary for realistic single-neuron and population statistics.\nTo realize this on long neural recordings, LDNS uses S4 state-space layers in the encoder/decoder, which excel at modeling long-range temporal dependencies, ensuring the latents remain time-aligned and informative. Finally, practical conditional diffusion and guidance techniques (as in Dhariwal & Nichol) inform LDNS\u2019s behavior-dependent sampling, enabling control over generated activity. Together, these strands yield a model that recovers latent structure and firing rates while generating spike trains with realistic statistics, advancing beyond prior latent neural models by marrying them with the expressive priors of diffusion.",
