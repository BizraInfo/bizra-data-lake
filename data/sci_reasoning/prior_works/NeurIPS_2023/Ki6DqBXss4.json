  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014reducing online label-shift adaptation to online regression while attaining optimal dynamic regret without knowing the drift\u2014sits at the intersection of label-shift quantification and nonstationary online optimization. Classical label-shift correction methods (Saerens et al., 2002) establish the problem setting and the feasibility of adapting predictions when only class priors drift. Black-Box Shift Estimation (Lipton et al., 2018) crystallizes a practical route: infer class proportions from black-box predictions via confusion-matrix-based relationships, a key conceptual stepping stone to the paper\u2019s regression-based estimation of time-varying priors from unlabeled streams. Early quantification methods like Forman (2005) underscore the practicality of prevalence estimation from classifier outputs, which the present work operationalizes in an online manner by bootstrapping regression oracles.\nOn the online learning side, the paper\u2019s regret targets rely on the nonstationary optimization literature. Besbes, Gur, and Zeevi (2015) provide the variation-budget lens and optimal dynamic-regret rates that guide the theory here, while Zinkevich (2003) and Herbster & Warmuth (1998) supply the OCO and tracking-comparator foundations for adapting to drifting targets. Finally, the design choice to reduce the adaptation task to online regression oracles is inspired by oracle-based reductions from contextual bandits (Agarwal et al., 2014), enabling practical algorithms with strong guarantees. Together, these strands directly inform both the algorithmic reduction and the dynamic-regret-optimal analysis achieved in the paper.",
