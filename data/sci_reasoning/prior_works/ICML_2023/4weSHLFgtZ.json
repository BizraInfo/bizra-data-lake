  "synthesis_narrative": "GibbsDDRM\u2019s core contribution\u2014solving blind linear inverse problems by sampling jointly over the signal and unknown operator using a pretrained diffusion prior\u2014emerges from two converging lines of work. First, score/diffusion models (Song et al.) established powerful data priors and a posterior-sampling view for inverse problems, which DDRM (Kawar et al.) operationalized into efficient conditional updates when the forward operator is known. However, diffusion-based restorations such as DDRM and DPS (Chung et al.) fundamentally require knowledge of the measurement operator, a critical gap for blind settings. GibbsDDRM targets precisely this gap by lifting the DDRM framework to a joint model over data, measurements, and operator, and by sampling the posterior when the operator is unknown.\n\nThe second thread comes from Bayesian treatments of blind inverse problems. Classical blind deconvolution (Levin et al.) formalized the joint estimation of image and kernel under priors, highlighting the importance of principled probabilistic modeling to avoid degeneracies. More recently, Double-DIP (Gandelsman et al.) illustrated that problem-agnostic, joint priors over image and operator can solve diverse blind tasks, motivating GibbsDDRM\u2019s problem-agnostic posture. To make the joint sampling efficient, GibbsDDRM adopts the partially collapsed Gibbs strategy (Park & van Dyk), collapsing appropriate latent variables to improve mixing and computational tractability. Altogether, GibbsDDRM fuses DDRM\u2019s diffusion-based restoration with Bayesian blind modeling and partially collapsed Gibbs sampling, removing the \u201cknown operator\u201d assumption while retaining problem-agnostic applicability.",
