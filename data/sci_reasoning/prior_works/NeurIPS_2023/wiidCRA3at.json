  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core idea\u2014using Stein importance sampling on a chain invariant to an auxiliary \u03a0 (rather than the target P), and selecting \u03a0 via a variational Stein criterion\u2014stands at the intersection of Stein discrepancy methodology, MCMC post-processing, and classical importance sampling design. Kernelized Stein discrepancy (Liu & Lee, 2016) and its theoretical development (Gorham & Mackey, 2017) provide the operator- and RKHS-based foundations for quantifying sample quality and constructing zero-mean Stein adjustments that yield consistent reweighting. This directly connects to Stein control functionals (Oates, Girolami & Chopin, 2017), which established how RKHS Stein features can reduce Monte Carlo variance and framed the analysis of consistency for post-processed estimators. Practical success of Stein-based post-processing for MCMC was highlighted by KSD-driven thinning (Riabiz et al., 2021), motivating the paper\u2019s shift from merely repairing P-invariant chains to proactively designing chains that are well-suited to Stein reweighting. The paper\u2019s key conceptual leap\u2014that the best \u03a0 for Stein IS need not equal P\u2014mirrors classical importance sampling insights on proposal optimality (Owen & Zhou, 2000). Finally, the variational argument used to construct \u03a0 draws on the variational perspective of Stein operators as descent directions for divergence objectives (SVGD; Liu & Wang, 2016), while complementary Stein GOF tools (Chwialkowski et al., 2016) inform operator choices and convergence guarantees. Together, these works directly enable the paper\u2019s formulation, optimization of \u03a0, and convergence results.",
