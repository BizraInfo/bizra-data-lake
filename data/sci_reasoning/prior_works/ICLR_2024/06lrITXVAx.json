  "synthesis_narrative": "Bilevel learning for hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning was placed on firm algorithmic footing by work that formalized a differentiable bilevel objective and practical hypergradient computation, notably through implicit differentiation and reverse-mode techniques. A key strand demonstrated how to obtain hypergradients without unrolling long inner loops, using Hessian-inverse\u2013vector products and conjugate-gradient\u2013style solvers, and further scaled these ideas to extremely high-dimensional hyperparameters via efficient implicit differentiation. In parallel, dropout emerged as a powerful regularizer against overfitting, with analyses showing it behaves like an adaptive, data-dependent regularization and, from a probabilistic lens, as sampling from a distribution over subnetworks governed by Bernoulli masks. These perspectives clarified that dropout induces a stochastic objective whose statistics depend on the dropout rate, but prior theory largely addressed single-level training and stopped short of characterizing its influence on bilevel hypergradients or providing convergence guarantees. Bringing these threads together naturally suggests embedding dropout\u2019s stochastic masking into the bilevel formulation itself. This synthesis highlights a gap: while bilevel methods provide hypergradients and complexity guarantees, and dropout provides effective regularization, their interaction\u2014how the dropout rate modulates the hypergradient and the convergence of a bilevel method under mask randomness\u2014remained unaddressed. The present work fills that gap by formulating a dropout-distribution\u2013aware bilevel objective, extending implicit hypergradient tools to incorporate dropout-induced terms, and establishing optimization complexity guarantees, thereby regularizing overfit-prone bilevel training with principled analysis.",

    "abstract": "Bilevel optimization problems appear in many widely used machine learning tasks. Bilevel optimization models are sensitive to small changes, and bilevel training tasks typically involve limited datasets. Therefore, overfitting is a common challenge in bilevel training tasks. This paper considers the use of dropout to address this problem. We propose a bilevel optimization model that depends on the distribution of dropout masks. We investigate how the dropout rate affects the hypergradient of this model. We propose a dropout bilevel method to solve the dropout bilevel optimization model. Subsequently, we analyze the resulting dropout bilevel method from an optimization perspective. Analyzing the optimization properties of methods with dropout is essential because it provides convergence guarantees for methods using dropout. However, there has been limited investigation in this research direction. We provide the complexity of the resulting dropout bilevel method in terms of reaching an $",
