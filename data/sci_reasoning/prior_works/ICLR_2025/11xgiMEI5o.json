  "synthesis_narrative": "OmniRe\u2019s core innovation\u2014holistic, object-centric reconstruction of dynamic urban scenes with real-time performance\u2014stands on three intertwined threads of prior work. First, 3D Gaussian Splatting provides the real-time rendering and learnable primitive that make high-frequency simulation feasible; OmniRe directly builds its per-object models and entire scene graph on this representation. Second, the canonical-space lineage from D-NeRF and HyperNeRF informs OmniRe\u2019s actor modeling: each dynamic object (vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists) is represented in a canonical Gaussian space with explicit motion to observed frames, transplanting the canonical/deformation paradigm from NeRFs to Gaussians. Third, the structural idea of managing scenes as collections of moving objects comes from Neural Scene Graphs and panoptic object-aware neural fields. OmniRe fuses these object-centric decompositions with Gaussian splatting to scale to urban settings and to support diverse actor categories\u2014addressing a central gap in dynamic Gaussian methods like 4D Gaussian Splatting that generally treat a single dynamic subject or scene-level motion. Compositional scene thinking from GIRAFFE further reinforced the benefits of object-level factorization, which OmniRe operationalizes for reconstruction rather than generation. Together, these works directly shaped OmniRe\u2019s design: object-centric canonical Gaussian actors organized by a scene graph, enabling the first comprehensive, fast reconstruction of heterogeneous dynamic urban scenes suitable for downstream, human-in-the-loop simulation.",
