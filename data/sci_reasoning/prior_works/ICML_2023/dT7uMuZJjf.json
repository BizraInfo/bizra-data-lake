  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014recovering and consistently combining projections of a high-dimensional causal effect when instruments are fewer than treatments, and actively selecting instruments across sequential experiments\u2014sits at the intersection of classical IV identification, GMM, optimal design, and modern insights on projected solutions.\nSargan\u2019s formulation of linear IV and 2SLS, together with Angrist\u2013Imbens\u2013Rubin\u2019s causal interpretation, anchors the problem setting and target estimand. Hansen\u2019s GMM provides the methodological backbone for aggregation: each experiment contributes moment conditions that, while insufficient to identify the full parameter, identify a projection; stacking these moments yields a consistent combined estimator. The paper explicitly responds to limitations in the high-dimensional IV literature (Belloni\u2013Chernozhukov\u2013Hansen), which presumes enough valid instruments (or sparsity enabling recovery of the full vector); the authors instead characterize what is identifiable under rank deficiency and how to accumulate information across experiments. In parallel, the z-identifiability line (Bareinboim\u2013Pearl) motivates situations where one can only intervene on surrogates/instruments; when those surrogates fail to fully identify the effect, the present work recovers the identifiable projections and plans additional surrogate experiments. Conceptually, the view that each experiment reveals a projection of the parameter is inspired by sketching methods (Pilanci\u2013Wainwright), where partial linear systems yield projected solutions that can be combined. Finally, sequential instrument selection is grounded in optimal experimental design (Chaloner\u2013Verdinelli), guiding which instruments to deploy next to maximally expand the instrumented subspace and reduce estimator variance.",
