  "synthesis_narrative": "The key contribution\u2014designing a generator-augmented flow that reduces the discrepancy between consistency training and consistency distillation while lowering transport cost\u2014sits at the intersection of consistency modeling, diffusion ODEs, and flow-matching theory. Consistency Models established the one-step paradigm and its two training routes, revealing a practical gap between teacher-supervised distillation and single-sample Monte Carlo (MC) consistency training. The SDE/probability-flow ODE framework of score-based generative modeling formally defines the true velocity field that one-step models strive to emulate, while DDIM\u2019s deterministic trajectories demonstrate how ODE-style paths can realize diffusion sampling without stochasticity. Flow Matching crystallizes the idea of training via vector-field regression using single-sample MC estimators, directly motivating the paper\u2019s focus on estimator-induced discrepancy and its mitigation by altering the underlying flow. Rectified Flow shows that careful path choice can substantially reduce kinetic or transport cost and improve optimization, a principle the present work adopts by constructing a path that transports noisy inputs toward their consistency-model outputs. Finally, Stochastic Interpolants provide a unifying lens linking path design, velocity estimation, and cost, underpinning the paper\u2019s continuous-time analysis and theoretical guarantees. Together, these works enabled the authors to identify why consistency training lags distillation and to craft a provably beneficial flow that accelerates convergence and improves one-step generation quality.",
