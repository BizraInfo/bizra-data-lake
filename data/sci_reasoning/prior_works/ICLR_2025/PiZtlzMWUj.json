  "synthesis_narrative": "SoftCVI\u2019s core innovation\u2014casting variational inference for unnormalized posteriors as a contrastive classification problem with self-generated soft labels\u2014emerges from a tight lineage spanning contrastive estimation and multi-sample variational bounds. The foundational step is Noise-Contrastive Estimation, which reframed learning with unnormalized densities as classification; SoftCVI adopts this lens but discards the need for explicit positives and negatives by computing Bayes-optimal soft class probabilities directly from the unnormalized posterior and the variational proposal. Goodfellow\u2019s distinguishability criteria and self-contrastive perspective further informed the move to use the current model/proposal as the \u2018noise\u2019 mechanism, precisely what SoftCVI does by anchoring labels to log p\u0303(x)\u2212log q(x).\nOn the variational side, Importance Weighted Autoencoders established that normalized importance weights over K samples yield tighter bounds; SoftCVI\u2019s soft labels collapse to these weights under a specific scoring choice, unifying IWAE within a contrastive classification objective and thereby generating a family of VI objectives. The InfoNCE paradigm contributed the K-way identification template that SoftCVI repurposes, replacing one-hot positives with posterior-derived soft targets. Finally, f-GAN demonstrated discriminator-based variational divergence estimation; SoftCVI achieves a similar goal without adversarial training or sampling from the target by leveraging exact soft labels, and it directly tackles the practical shortcomings of standard ELBO/BBVI baselines on complex geometries. Collectively, these works provide the conceptual and technical scaffolding SoftCVI extends into a stable, label-free contrastive VI framework.",
