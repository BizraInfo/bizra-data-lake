  "synthesis_narrative": "Orthogonal Attention emerges at the intersection of operator learning, spectral decompositions, and kernel-based views of attention. Foundational neural-operator works\u2014Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), DeepONet, and the Neural Operator framework\u2014cast operator learning as approximating kernel integral mappings between function spaces. FNO shows the power of spectral parametrizations but relies on fixed Fourier bases, while DeepONet and the Neural Operator theory clarify how operators can be captured via basis functions acting on inputs. Orthogonal Attention advances this line by invoking Mercer-style decompositions and directly parameterizing the operator\u2019s eigenfunctions with neural networks.\nConcurrently, the attention literature provides an architectural lens. Self-attention (Transformer) is a data-dependent kernel smoother; efficient variants such as Performer and Nystr\u00f6mformer recast attention as kernel approximation, often softmax-free and low-rank. Orthogonal Attention leverages this equivalence but replaces generic or random features with task-adaptive eigenfunctions, yielding an attention-like module without softmax whose weights arise from projections onto learned orthonormal bases. Finally, insights from orthogonality regularization in deep learning motivate explicit orthogonalization of these bases, improving stability and generalization in low-data PDE regimes. Together, these threads directly shape the paper\u2019s core contribution: a principled, spectrally grounded attention module that learns orthonormal eigenfunctions of the kernel integral operator, providing both improved inductive bias for PDE operators and regularization through enforced orthogonality.",
