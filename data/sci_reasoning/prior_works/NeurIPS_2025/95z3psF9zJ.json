  "synthesis_narrative": "DCCD-CONF sits at the intersection of differentiable structure learning, interventional causal discovery, cyclic structural causal models, and latent-variable modeling. The differentiable backbone of the method is inspired by NOTEARS, which reframed graph discovery as smooth likelihood maximization; DCCD-CONF preserves this optimization view while moving beyond DAGs. The incorporation of interventional data into a gradient-based objective follows the template of DCDI and the broader lesson from GIES that interventions sharpen identifiability and can guide structure search. To legitimately model feedback and unobserved confounding, DCCD-CONF is grounded in the formal semantics of cyclic SCMs with latent variables articulated by Bongers, Peters, and Mooij, ensuring that the objective corresponds to well-defined interventions and equilibria in nonlinear settings.\n\nA second pillar is the handling of unmeasured confounders. CEVAE demonstrated how to represent unobserved confounding with latent variables and learn their distributions via (variational) likelihood. DCCD-CONF adopts a compatible strategy\u2014estimating a confounder distribution jointly with structural parameters\u2014while targeting graph recovery rather than only effect estimation. The algorithmic structure of alternation between latent-variable inference and graph optimization echoes Friedman\u2019s Structural EM, adapting the classic E/M split to a modern, neural and interventional context. Finally, classical work on feedback discovery such as Richardson\u2019s CCD motivates the pursuit of cyclic structures; DCCD-CONF advances this line by replacing constraint-based reasoning with a scalable differentiable framework. Collectively, these works directly shape DCCD-CONF\u2019s core contribution: a likelihood-driven, differentiable procedure for learning nonlinear cyclic causal graphs under unmeasured confounding from interventional data.",
