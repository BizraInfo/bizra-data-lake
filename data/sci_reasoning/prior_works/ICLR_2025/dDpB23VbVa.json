  "synthesis_narrative": "Patch-level training for LLMs sits at the intersection of two mature lines of work: (1) reducing effective sequence length by aggregating fine-grained units into higher-information tokens, and (2) supervising models at span-level granularity rather than single next tokens. Vision Transformers introduced the modern \"patch\" abstraction, proving that grouping local elements into fixed-size tokens can dramatically shorten sequences without sacrificing performance. In NLP, Charformer\u2019s learnable GBST patches and CANINE\u2019s character-level downsampling offered direct textual analogs, empirically validating that pooling multiple small units into fewer latent tokens yields efficiency with minimal quality loss.\n\nConcurrently, span-level objectives in T5 and BART established that predicting contiguous multi-token segments is a powerful and sample-efficient training signal, moving beyond purely next-token supervision. This provides the learning-theoretic footing for \u201cnext-patch\u201d prediction: the model can acquire rich sequence regularities from fewer, denser training steps. Finally, Compressive Transformers showed that carefully designed compression mechanisms can preserve modeling capacity while lowering compute, reinforcing the feasibility of training-time compaction strategies.\n\nThe new paper synthesizes these ideas into a two-phase recipe: first, train on shortened sequences of aggregated patches (borrowing the patch abstraction and span-level supervision benefits), then switch to token-level training to align with inference. This combination delivers substantial training-cost reductions while retaining token-level performance at test time, a direct product of prior demonstrations that aggregation and span-wise objectives can be both efficient and effective.",
