  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014showing that a finite, dimension-dependent vocabulary of maps of size O(d^2) suffices for universal approximation via composition\u2014sits at the intersection of classical approximation theory and modern compositional architectures. Kolmogorov\u2019s superposition theorem is the conceptual keystone: it proved that multivariate continuous functions arise from compositions with a finite set of inner functions depending only on dimension, directly inspiring the search for a dimension-dependent, function-agnostic vocabulary. Cybenko\u2019s universal approximation theorem provided the standard compact-domain formulation and error criterion, which this work preserves while overcoming the need for continuously varying weights. Hutchinson\u2019s iterated function systems offered a powerful precedent that finite sets of maps, repeatedly composed, can generate complex structures\u2014an idea mirrored here for function approximation rather than set attractors.\n\nContemporary expressivity results highlight the precise gap this paper closes. Lu et al. established width-bounded universality and Yarotsky gave constructive error bounds, but both frameworks crucially require an effectively infinite continuum of adjustable weights. By contrast, this paper proves universality from a fixed, finite alphabet of mappings. Finally, linear-algebraic factorization tools like Householder reflections inform the constructive argument and the O(d^2) scaling by showing how general linear components can be assembled from a small set of primitive transformations. Relatedly, universality results for coupling-based normalizing flows (Teshima et al.) demonstrate that stacking a fixed-form block can be universally expressive; this work broadens that compositional paradigm to arbitrary continuous maps with a finite, pre-specified vocabulary.",
