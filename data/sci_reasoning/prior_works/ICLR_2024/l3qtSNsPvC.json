  "synthesis_narrative": "Anis, Gadde, and Ortega showed how to sample and reconstruct bandlimited graph signals by projecting onto Laplacian eigenspaces and selecting sampling sets with explicit spectral criteria, and Tsitsvero, Barbarossa, and Di Lorenzo characterized uniqueness sets and cut-off frequencies for Paley\u2013Wiener spaces through the graph Fourier basis. These works crystallized the role of spectral projectors in sampling guarantees but tied them to graph-specific eigendecompositions. Earlier, Pesenson developed a complementary viewpoint: Poincar\u00e9-type inequalities on graphs can certify uniqueness sets for bandlimited spaces without explicitly invoking eigenvectors, revealing an alternative functional-analytic route to sampling guarantees. Lov\u00e1sz\u2019s graphon framework then provided a rigorous limit object for dense graph sequences and associated integral operators, enabling asymptotic reasoning about large graphs. Building on this, Ruiz and co-authors introduced graphon signal processing tools\u2014operators, spectra, and a graphon Fourier transform\u2014establishing the harmonic analysis needed to speak of Paley\u2013Wiener spaces in the graphon domain. Finally, Lei and Rinaldo\u2019s spectral clustering consistency connected empirical graph spectra to limit operators, clarifying how spectral structures converge under graphon models. Together, these strands exposed a gap: practical graph sampling theory lacked a limit-object formulation that both certifies uniqueness via functional inequalities and ensures sampling-set stability as graphs grow. The present paper synthesizes Pesenson\u2019s Poincar\u00e9-based uniqueness insight with graphon harmonic analysis to prove a Poincar\u00e9 inequality for graphon signals, uses it to characterize unique sampling sets for graphon Paley\u2013Wiener spaces, and, leveraging spectral convergence ideas from clustering, establishes that unique sampling sets on convergent graph sequences are consistent with the graphon limit\u2014yielding a scalable sampling algorithm for large graphs.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale graph machine learning is challenging as the complexity of learning models scales with the graph size. Subsampling the graph is a viable alternative, but sampling on graphs is nontrivial as graphs are non-Euclidean. Existing graph sampling techniques require not only computing the spectra of large matrices but also repeating these computations when the graph changes, e.g., grows. In this paper, we introduce a signal sampling theory for a type of graph limit---the graphon. We prove a Poincar\u00e9 inequality for graphon signals and show that complements of node subsets satisfying this inequality are unique sampling sets for Paley-Wiener spaces of graphon signals. Exploiting connections with spectral clustering and Gaussian elimination, we prove that such sampling sets are consistent in the sense that unique sampling sets on a convergent graph sequence converge to unique sampling sets on the graphon. We then propose a related graphon signal sampling algorithm for large graphs, and",
