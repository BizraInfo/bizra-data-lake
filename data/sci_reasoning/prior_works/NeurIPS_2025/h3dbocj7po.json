  "synthesis_narrative": "GraphMaster targets a core gap exposed by structural graph generators\u2014Kronecker Graphs, GraphRNN, and NetGAN\u2014which excel at reproducing topology but neglect the semantically rich textual attributes increasingly crucial for real-world graph applications. TextGCN demonstrated that text-attributed graphs can unlock stronger task performance, reinforcing the need for synthesis approaches that create meaningful node/edge text rather than only edges. Concurrently, the Open Graph Benchmark underscored the shortage and limited diversity of large, high-quality graph corpora, a central bottleneck for training and evaluating graph foundation models. To overcome LLM limitations (context, hallucination, and structural inconsistency) when creating complex graphs, GraphMaster draws methodological inspiration from the ReAct paradigm: it decomposes generation into agent roles that reason, act with tools/validators, and iteratively feedback to each other. This agentic loop, complemented by Self-Instruct\u2019s iterative bootstrapping ethos, enables GraphMaster to scale synthesis in data-limited settings while improving faithfulness and constraint satisfaction over iterations. In combination, these prior lines of work\u2014structural graph generation, evidence of the value of text-attributed graphs, recognition of dataset scarcity for GFMs, and agentic LLM control for iterative reasoning and verification\u2014directly shaped GraphMaster\u2019s multi-agent design for producing structurally consistent, semantically meaningful synthetic graphs tailored to the needs of graph foundation models.",
