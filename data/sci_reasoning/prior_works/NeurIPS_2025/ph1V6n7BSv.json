  "synthesis_narrative": "EDELINE\u2019s core contribution\u2014unifying diffusion-based observation modeling with linear-time state-space sequence modeling to unlock long-horizon memory\u2014emerges at the intersection of three lines of work. First, PlaNet and DreamerV2 established recurrent state-space world models that jointly model latent dynamics, rewards, and terminations for sample-efficient RL. While these models excel in compact sequence modeling, their discrete or heavily compressed latents can sacrifice visual fidelity, motivating a higher-capacity observation generator.\nSecond, diffusion models advanced visual fidelity. Latent Diffusion made high-resolution generation efficient, and Video Diffusion Models demonstrated next-frame prediction conditioned on a short context. However, such diffusion approaches typically rely on fixed windows, limiting memory and making it natural to bolt on separate RNN heads for rewards/terminations\u2014fragmenting the world model. Diffuser further showed diffusion\u2019s suitability for sequential decision-making, reinforcing the premise that diffusion can model temporally structured processes.\nThird, modern State Space Models such as S4 and Mamba provide linear-time sequence modeling with strong long-range dependency capture, offering an attractive alternative to quadratic-cost attention for memory. EDELINE synthesizes these threads by conditioning a diffusion-based observation decoder on an SSM state that summarizes arbitrarily long histories, while using the same SSM backbone to model rewards and terminations. This replaces fixed-window conditioning with scalable, unified memory, addressing visual fidelity and long-horizon credit simultaneously and yielding improved performance on Atari 100k, Crafter, and ViZDoom.",
