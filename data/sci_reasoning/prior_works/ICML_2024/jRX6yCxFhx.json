  "synthesis_narrative": "The ICML position paper\u2019s central contribution\u2014a framework to assess the marginal risk of open foundation models\u2014stands on a lineage that first defined the technology and mapped its societal stakes, then problematized release choices, and finally exposed gaps in risk evaluation. Bommasani et al. (2021) established the foundation model paradigm and a comprehensive societal impact lens, which this paper narrows to the distinctive case of open-weight releases. Solaiman et al. (2019) made release strategy a core governance variable; the present work directly extends this idea by focusing specifically on openness and formalizing marginal risk as the key decision-relevant quantity. To structure concrete misuse vectors, the authors adopt the DeepMind taxonomy of harms from Weidinger et al. (2021), but recast it around comparisons to pre-existing technologies to ask whether open models add incremental capability or access. Shevlane et al. (2023) identified the methodological deficit in evaluating catastrophic misuse, a deficit this paper addresses by insisting on counterfactual, baseline-grounded comparisons as the right evidentiary standard for openness decisions. Methodologically, the paper borrows HELM\u2019s (Liang et al., 2022) commitment to broad scenario coverage and credible baselines to argue that marginal risk must be measured against non-AI tools and existing channels. Finally, empirical insights from the Foundation Model Transparency Index (Bommasani et al., 2023) inform the paper\u2019s characterization of openness: enhancing external auditability while weakening centralized monitoring, a tension that shapes both benefits and risks in the proposed framework.",
