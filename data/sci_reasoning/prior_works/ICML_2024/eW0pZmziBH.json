  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014provable, time-efficient spectral inference for the Partial Credit Model (PCM) and an EM-based learner for mixtures\u2014rests on two pillars: the psychometric formulation of ordered-categorical Rasch models and the modern spectral paradigm for latent-variable estimation. Andrich (1978) and Masters (1982) provide the foundational PCM structure of adjacent-category logits with step difficulties and person abilities; the new algorithm is expressly built for this parameterization and its identifiability. In practice, PCM estimation has long relied on EM/MML (Bock & Aitkin, 1981), which serves as the primary baseline but is computationally heavy and lacks finite-sample optimality guarantees\u2014precisely the gaps this work addresses with a spectral alternative and sharp non-asymptotic analysis. On the algorithmic side, the paper draws from spectral ranking: Negahban\u2013Oh\u2013Shah\u2019s Rank Centrality (2012) established a Markov-chain-based spectral estimator with performance guarantees in the BTL model. The present work extends that spectral construction from binary pairwise comparisons to PCM\u2019s multi-level adjacent logits, enabling a fast, statistically optimal estimator tailored to partial-credit data. For mixtures, Rost (1991) formalized polytomous mixture Rasch models, providing the exact mixture setting tackled here. The design of a spectral core coupled with a likelihood-based refinement echoes Spectral MLE (Chen & Suh, 2015) and is broadly aligned with the lesson from spectral method-of-moments for latent-variable models (Anandkumar et al., 2014): use a scalable spectral learner to obtain high-quality estimates, then refine via EM, achieving both efficiency and optimal accuracy.",
