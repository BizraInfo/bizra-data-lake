  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution is an information-theoretic unification of context-based offline meta-RL (COMRL), showing that diverse algorithms effectively optimize the same mutual information objective between a task variable M and its latent representation Z. This builds directly on the evolution of context-based meta-RL. RL^2 first established that policies can adapt by encoding task information from within-episode experience, motivating the search for explicit task representations. PEARL advanced this by introducing a probabilistic context variable Z learned via amortized variational inference, while VariBAD formalized task beliefs as latent variables trained with an ELBO. The present work demonstrates that these ELBO-driven methods are instantiations of optimizing a variational lower bound on I(Z; M), grounding their success in information maximization.\nCrucially, the framework leverages classic and modern MI estimation tools to both interpret and design COMRL algorithms. The Barber\u2013Agakov variational bound connects ELBO-based encoders to mutual information, revealing why variational context encoders learn discriminative task latents. MINE provides trainable neural estimators for MI, enabling flexible self-supervised optimization of I(Z; M) from offline datasets without explicit likelihood models. Complementarily, CPC\u2019s InfoNCE bound yields a practical contrastive route to maximize I(Z; M) by pulling together representations from the same task while pushing apart different tasks. By mapping prior COMRL milestones onto these MI bounds, the paper offers a principled lens that not only explains existing successes but also guides new supervised and self-supervised implementations for robust offline meta-adaptation.",
