  "synthesis_narrative": "TRIDENT\u2019s core innovation\u2014global tri-modal alignment of SMILES, text, and taxonomy with a volume-based objective plus fine-grained substructure grounding\u2014crystallizes ideas from cross-modal, non-contrastive, hierarchical, and molecular representation learning.\nCLIP established the efficacy of aligning heterogeneous modalities via large-scale supervision, but its reliance on hard contrastive pairs exposes brittleness and negative-sampling sensitivity; TRIDENT addresses this by adopting a non-contrastive, geometry-aware approach. VICReg directly informs this shift: its variance\u2013invariance\u2013covariance regularization shows that negatives are unnecessary if representation geometry (volume and covariance) is controlled, a principle TRIDENT generalizes to tri-modal joint alignment. DCCA contributes the multi-view perspective, motivating an objective that coherently aligns three encoders rather than optimizing disjoint pairwise losses.\nTo model structured functional labels, Poincar\u00e9 embeddings motivate encoding hierarchical taxonomy with appropriate geometry, guiding TRIDENT\u2019s use of taxonomic signals in both global and local objectives. At the fine-grained level, UNITER\u2019s token-region grounding and OT-based alignment inspire TRIDENT\u2019s local correspondence loss that links molecular substructures to relevant textual/taxonomic spans, moving beyond coarse graph-level matches. On the molecular encoder side, ChemBERTa provides an effective SMILES transformer pretraining substrate. Finally, JTVAE\u2019s motif-centric decomposition informs TRIDENT\u2019s choice of chemically meaningful substructure units for local grounding. Together, these works directly shape TRIDENT\u2019s tri-modal design, its non-contrastive, volume-based global alignment, and its substructure-aware local grounding strategy.",
