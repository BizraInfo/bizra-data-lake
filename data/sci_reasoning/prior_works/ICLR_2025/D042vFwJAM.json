  "synthesis_narrative": "Diffusion Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge introduced a principled way to learn stochastic bridges by estimating forward and reverse drifts so that paths connect prescribed endpoints, establishing the machinery for distribution-to-distribution transport via learned score fields. Score-Based Generative Modeling through SDEs provided the reverse-time SDE formulation and time-conditioned score networks that enable stable training and sampling of such bridges. Diffusion Posterior Sampling showed that constraints arising from measurements can be enforced during diffusion sampling through projection and data-consistency steps, demonstrating how generative trajectories can be steered to satisfy external conditions. Physics-Informed Neural Networks formalized embedding governing-equation and boundary residuals into the training objective for forward and inverse PDE problems, but also revealed difficulties on complex, multi-scale dynamics. Fourier Neural Operator established an efficient baseline for mapping from sparse/coarse information to full fields, widely used for super-resolution and reconstruction in fluids, though it generally lacks strict physics compliance. Physics-Informed Neural Operator combined operator learning with physics residual penalties to improve physical fidelity, hinting that fusing data-driven and physics-based objectives can enhance reconstruction.\nTogether, these works expose a gap: strong priors from diffusion models and bridges can transport distributions but need principled mechanisms to honor PDE and boundary constraints, while deterministic PINN/NO approaches encode physics yet falter on complex fields. The natural next step is to embed physics residuals and boundary conditions as endpoint/trajectory constraints within a diffusion-bridge framework, trained in a way that separates local reconstruction fidelity from global physical alignment and uses constraint-aware sampling to enforce boundaries\u2014precisely the synthesis realized by PalSB.",

    "abstract": "The reconstruction of physical fields from sparse measurements is pivotal in both scientific research and engineering applications. Traditional methods are increasingly supplemented by deep learning models due to their efficacy in extracting features from data. However, except for the low accuracy on complex physical systems, these models often fail to comply with essential physical constraints, such as governing equations and boundary conditions. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel data-driven field reconstruction framework, termed the Physics-aligned Schr\\\"{o}dinger Bridge (PalSB). This framework leverages a diffusion bridge mechanism that is specifically tailored to align with physical constraints. The PalSB approach incorporates a dual-stage training process designed to address both local reconstruction mapping and global physical principles. Additionally, a boundary-aware sampling technique is implemented to ensure adherence to physical boundary conditions. We demons",
