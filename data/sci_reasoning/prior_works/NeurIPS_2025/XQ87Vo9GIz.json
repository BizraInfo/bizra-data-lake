  "synthesis_narrative": "TransferTraj targets two traditionally disjoint challenges in mobility modeling: cross-region generalization and cross-task reuse of a single model. Its region-transfer backbone is grounded in the spatiotemporal graph literature\u2014DCRNN, ST-GCN, and Graph WaveNet established that mobility dynamics are best captured by operators that couple temporal modeling with data-driven spatial connectivity. TransferTraj internalizes this principle for trajectories rather than fixed sensor graphs, then introduces mechanisms to make the learned movement representations portable across cities without re-training. On the task-transfer side, the paper inherits a core systems idea from Perceiver IO: decouple a powerful, modality-agnostic latent encoder from flexible IO transforms. By pairing a universal trajectory encoder with lightweight output mappings, TransferTraj can serve heterogeneous tasks (e.g., next-location, destination, travel time) without rebuilding the model. This is reinforced by parameter-efficient transfer ideas (adapters) that minimize per-task parameters while leaving the backbone intact. Finally, self-supervised pretraining\u2014epitomized by SimCLR\u2014supplies a robust path to task-agnostic trajectory embeddings that avoid overfitting to any single region or task. Compared to meta-learning approaches like ST-MetaNet that adapt models to new regions episodically, TransferTraj emphasizes a single, transferable representation that works across regions and tasks out-of-the-box, unifying prior insights into a cohesive trajectory foundation model for mobility.",
