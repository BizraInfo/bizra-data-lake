  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core idea\u2014efficient, separate authentication for multi-recipient image steganography using an invertible network\u2014emerges from two converging threads. First, deep image hiding was established by Baluja\u2019s end-to-end image-in-image framework and later generalized to robust, neural encoder\u2013decoder training by HiDDeN. These works defined the learning setup (cover\u2013container\u2013secret triad, differentiable distortions, and end-to-end optimization) that the present method adopts as its baseline training paradigm. Second, invertible flows, as instantiated by Glow, made it practical to enforce bijective mappings with tractable Jacobians in image models. This invertibility is crucial for distributing and recovering large-capacity hidden information without loss, enabling the paper\u2019s two-stage distribution adaptation between secrets and keys.\nParallel progress in information hiding and authentication supplied the separability concept the authors exploit. Yeung and Mintzer framed the image authentication problem using fragile watermarking, but their approach and descendants impose payload overhead that competes with content capacity\u2014precisely the inefficiency this paper targets. Zhang\u2019s separable reversible data hiding in encrypted images introduced the principle of task/key separation: different keys unlock different functions. This directly informs the proposed separate authentication mechanism via multiple lock\u2013key pairs so that recipients can be isolated in what they can verify or reveal. Finally, Abadi and Andersen\u2019s adversarial neural cryptography motivates learning key-conditioned hide/reveal pathways. Together, these works shape a system that maintains large-capacity, multi-recipient hiding while decoupling authentication from payload to avoid capacity loss and cross-recipient leakage.",
