  "synthesis_narrative": "Correa and Bareinboim\u2019s core advances\u2014Ancestral Multi-world Networks (AMNs) and a counterfactual calculus\u2014sit squarely on the structural causal model (SCM) paradigm and its graphical-algebraic tools. Pearl\u2019s Causality codified SCM semantics, d-separation, and the do-calculus, establishing how graphical constraints license algebraic transformations of interventional queries; the present work extends this logic from interventions to counterfactuals. Early counterfactual formalisms by Balke and Pearl introduced twin-network, multi-world constructions and optimization-based inference for counterfactuals, seeding the idea that cross-world structure can be made explicit and exploited. Richardson and Robins\u2019 SWIGs later provided a principled graphical representation for counterfactual variables within a single-world indexing scheme, enabling separation-based reading of counterfactual independences; AMNs generalize this line by assembling multi-world, ancestrally closed networks in which d-separation is sound and complete for counterfactual independences. On the identification side, Shpitser and Pearl developed complete algorithms for counterfactual identification, demonstrating that graphical structure suffices to reduce complex counterfactuals to estimands\u2014an algorithmic capability the new ctf-calculus abstracts into three general transformation rules. The completeness perspective is reinforced by Huang and Valtorta\u2019s proof that do-calculus is complete for interventional identification, which motivates and frames the paper\u2019s counterpart completeness claim for counterfactual transformations. Finally, Galles and Pearl\u2019s axiomatic characterization of counterfactuals provides the logical underpinnings for cross-world independences that AMNs encode graphically. Together, these works directly scaffold the paper\u2019s contribution: a sound-and-complete d-separation criterion for counterfactual independences and a calculus that generalizes do-calculus to the counterfactual domain.",
