  "synthesis_narrative": "3D Gaussian Splatting demonstrated that optimizing a set of localized primitives with differentiable splatting yields fast, stable inverse rendering and opened a path to primitive-centric scene representations. DMTet showed that parameterizing geometry volumetrically with tetrahedral elements enables robust, high-quality mesh extraction and differentiable optimization, but its fixed grid introduces bias and occasional irregular or non-manifold output. nvdiffrec established mesh-based inverse rendering as a practical baseline, coupling photometric objectives with mesh regularizers, yet relied on triangle parameterizations that can tangle or spawn floaters. NeuS introduced a surface-consistent volume rendering formulation for multi-view reconstruction, producing accurate surfaces but still suffering from floaters and non-manifold artifacts at extraction time. DreamGaussian transferred splatting primitives into text/image-to-3D pipelines, proving scalability for generative modeling but relying on post-hoc meshing or producing weak geometry. SDF-GS fused SDF estimation with Gaussian primitives to improve surface fidelity, yet its surfel-like primitives made manifoldness and floating artifacts difficult to control. Together, these works suggested that splatting-based Lagrangian optimization is powerful, volumetric tetrahedra produce cleaner meshes, and current primitive choices or implicit-to-mesh conversions limit manifoldness and regularity. The natural next step is to combine splatting\u2019s optimization and rendering pipeline with an explicitly volumetric, deformable primitive: tetrahedralized spheres. By adopting Lagrangian volumetric meshes and adding geometric regularizations and constraints, the current work integrates the strengths of splatting and tetrahedra while directly addressing grid bias, irregular triangles, non-manifoldness, and floaters, and it slots cleanly into both reconstruction and generative modeling pipelines.",

    "abstract": "We introduce TetSphere Splatting, a Lagrangian geometry representation designed for high-quality 3D shape modeling. TetSphere splatting leverages an underused yet powerful geometric primitive -- volumetric tetrahedral meshes. It represents 3D shapes by deforming a collection of tetrahedral spheres, with geometric regularizations and constraints that effectively resolve common mesh issues such as irregular triangles, non-manifoldness, and floating artifacts. Experimental results on multi-view and single-view reconstruction highlight TetSphere splatting's superior mesh quality while maintaining competitive reconstruction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, TetSphere splatting demonstrates versatility by seamlessly integrating into generative modeling tasks, such as image-to-3D and text-to-3D generation.",
