  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014diagnosing and removing the discretization bias that arises when training BSDE-based PDE solvers with Euler\u2013Maruyama inside a one-step self-consistency loss\u2014sits squarely on the lineage of BSDE theory and numerical SDE analysis. Pardoux and Peng (1990) established BSDEs and their connection to semilinear PDEs, defining the probabilistic framework modern deep BSDE solvers exploit. Han et al. (2017) operationalized this with the Deep BSDE method, using Euler\u2013Maruyama to discretize the forward\u2013backward dynamics and a one-step loss, a design choice the present work identifies as the source of a systematic bias that skews the optimization landscape. Attempts to reduce discretization error via multi-step training, such as Hur\u00e9, Pham, and Warin\u2019s deep backward schemes (2020), still inherit the EM-induced shift, a limitation this paper explicitly targets. The remedy draws from classical numerical SDE insights: Kloeden and Platen (1992) and Higham (2001) clarify how It\u00f4 versus Stratonovich interpretations and integrator choice dictate bias/consistency, motivating the move to a Stratonovich BSDE paired with a higher-accuracy stochastic Heun step. Burrage and Burrage (1996) provide the concrete SRK machinery\u2014of which Heun is a key instance\u2014that the method adopts. Finally, because PINNs (Raissi et al., 2019) have often outperformed standard deep BSDE solvers, they serve as the performance baseline the integration-aware redesign aims to match or surpass, closing the gap by correcting the underlying numerical bias rather than adding orthogonal optimizations.",
