  "synthesis_narrative": "SynGen\u2019s core insight\u2014enforcing correct attribute\u2013entity binding by aligning cross-attention maps according to syntactic structure\u2014emerges from three converging lines of prior work. First, Latent Diffusion Models established cross-attention as the operative mechanism for mapping text tokens to spatial features, providing the very signals SynGen measures and shapes. Second, a series of guidance methods for diffusion (classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance) demonstrated that one can inject external objectives at sampling time to steer generation without retraining. SynGen adopts this training-free, inference-time optimization template, but replaces class-based or unconditional guidance with a linguistically motivated alignment loss on attention maps. Third, cross-attention interpretability and control papers\u2014most notably Prompt-to-Prompt\u2014verified that token-specific attention maps localize semantics and can be manipulated during inference. Attend-and-Excite went further, proposing attention-based guidance losses to fix missing-object failures, directly inspiring SynGen\u2019s attention-centric, test-time loss design.\n\nComplementing these, compositional diffusion work on composable guidance clarified how to handle multi-entity prompts in a training-free manner, while grounded generation (GLIGEN) provided evidence that explicit spatial conditioning improves text\u2013image correspondence. SynGen synthesizes these threads by using a dependency parse to derive which modifiers should overlap with which entities, and then optimizing an attention-overlap/separation objective during denoising. This yields targeted corrections of attribute swaps and mismatches\u2014preserving the strengths of pretrained diffusion models while enforcing linguistically faithful bindings, all without additional training.",
