  "synthesis_narrative": "SFGC\u2019s key contribution\u2014condensing large graphs into a small set of graph-free nodes whose attributes implicitly encode topology\u2014is the confluence of two research threads: dataset distillation/condensation via training-dynamics matching and structure-decoupled graph learning. On the distillation side, Dataset Distillation established the paradigm of learning a synthetic dataset that can stand in for real data. Subsequent advances like Gradient Matching and Distribution Matching sharpened the optimization targets for condensation, emphasizing behavioral alignment between models trained on real versus synthetic data. Crucially, Matching Training Trajectories demonstrated that aligning full training trajectories can dramatically improve distilled-set fidelity and robustness; SFGC directly operationalizes this with a training trajectory meta-matching scheme tailored to GNNs.\nOn the graph-learning side, SGC and APPNP showed that message passing can be decoupled from feature transformation by precomputing diffusion/propagation, effectively pushing structural information into feature representations and allowing training with an identity adjacency. This evidence base makes SFGC\u2019s structure-free stance credible: if topology can be embedded into attributes, then a condensed node set without an explicit graph can still train GNN-like models effectively. SFGC integrates these strands by synthesizing node features that encode topology while using a trajectory-based objective to ensure the synthetic set reproduces GNN training dynamics, further augmented by a feature-score metric to dynamically assess and steer synthesis quality.",
