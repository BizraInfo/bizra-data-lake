  "synthesis_narrative": "Maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning introduced the principle of fitting rewards by matching expected feature statistics of expert behavior, establishing inverse learning as a tractable objective with convex structure. Building on this, generative adversarial imitation learning reframed IRL as a min\u2013max game that matches occupancy measures, supplying a practical adversarial loss that operationalizes distributional matching. Adversarial IRL further showed that stochastic first-order updates suffice to learn reward parameters, connecting adversarial objectives with sample-based oracles. On the algorithmic side, Nemirovski\u2019s Mirror-Prox provided an extragradient framework with polynomial-time guarantees for monotone convex\u2013concave saddle points, while Juditsky and Nemirovski extended these guarantees to stochastic oracles, yielding finite-sample complexity control. Complementing these, optimistic first-order dynamics were shown to stabilize and accelerate convergence in convex\u2013concave games, and a variational-inequality perspective on GANs clarified why extragradient-style methods are natural for adversarial training.\nTogether these works suggested a pathway: pose inverse learning as an adversarial saddle-point problem that matches observed behavior, and solve it with first-order methods possessing deterministic and stochastic oracle guarantees. The remaining opportunity was to enforce equilibrium consistency in multiagent settings and to deliver polynomial-time and sample-complexity bounds for estimating game payoffs and associated equilibria. By synthesizing adversarial behavioral matching with variational-inequality algorithms, the paper formalizes inverse multiagent learning and simulacral extensions as min\u2013max problems and provides efficient first-order procedures under both exact and stochastic oracles.",

We extend our approach to solve\ninverse multiagent simulacral learning in polynomial time and number of samples.\nIn these problems, we seek a simulacrum, meaning parameters and an associated\nequilibrium that replicate the given observations in expectation.
