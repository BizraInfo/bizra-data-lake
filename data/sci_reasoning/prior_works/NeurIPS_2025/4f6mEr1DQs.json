  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core idea\u2014learning a self-supervised complete structure from only incomplete point clouds and using it to guide completion\u2014is enabled by converging advances in self-supervised reconstruction and contrastive representation learning. On the reconstruction side, OcCo introduced occlusion completion as a pretext task, proving that recovering missing geometry from partial scans yields transferable 3D priors without ground-truth completions. Point-MAE further showed that masked token reconstruction can capture holistic 3D structure from partial inputs. These works directly motivate the paper\u2019s explicit complete-structure reconstruction module, which turns incomplete inputs into a learned structural guidance signal, eliminating reliance on complete supervision.\nComplementing reconstruction with discriminative learning, SimCLR provides the canonical instance-level InfoNCE objective the authors adapt to enforce invariance across different partial views/augmentations of the same object, stabilizing learning from incomplete data. SwAV\u2019s prototypical/cluster contrast inspires the paper\u2019s cluster-level objective: by contrasting cluster assignments of local geometric parts, the method injects semantic consistency at a coarser granularity and mitigates ambiguities caused by missing regions. PointContrast bridges these ideas in 3D, demonstrating how to form positive/negative pairs from partial scans, which the paper leverages for both instance- and cluster-level pair construction in point cloud space.\nFinally, supervised completion methods like PoinTr and PCN define architectures and benchmarks for point cloud completion but depend on complete ground-truth. The proposed framework inherits effective architectural practices while replacing supervision with self-learned complete structure plus multi-level contrast, achieving completion without complete training targets.",
