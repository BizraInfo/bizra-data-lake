  "synthesis_narrative": "Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF) is a direct response to the standard RLHF paradigm established by Christiano et al. and operationalized for language models by Ziegler et al. and Ouyang et al. That pipeline turns pairwise human preferences into a scalar reward via a Bradley\u2013Terry-style model and then applies KL-regularized PPO. NLHF challenges this reward-centric assumption at its root: rather than inferring a single-response score that is assumed to rationalize all comparisons, it learns a two-input preference model and defines the target policy as the Nash equilibrium of the induced two-player zero-sum game\u2014one policy\u2019s responses versus any competitor\u2019s. This game-theoretic target is motivated by and grounded in PSRO\u2019s framework for computing Nash policies in large games, providing a principled notion of unexploitable performance under possibly non-transitive preferences. Recent preference-only optimization methods like DPO reduced reliance on explicit RL but maintained the latent scalar reward assumption; NLHF identifies this as a key limitation and removes it, allowing preferences that cannot be globally rank-ordered. In short, NLHF\u2019s core innovation\u2014optimizing a Nash policy under a learned pairwise comparator\u2014emerges by fusing the RLHF problem setup (Christiano/Ziegler/Ouyang), the mathematical foundation of paired comparisons (Bradley\u2013Terry), and game-theoretic solution concepts and algorithms (PSRO), while explicitly addressing the gap revealed by DPO\u2019s dependence on a latent reward model.",
