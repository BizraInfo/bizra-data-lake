  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014showing that in finite-horizon, partially observed linear\u2013quadratic systems with unknown noise supported in Wasserstein balls around Gaussian models, the optimal controller remains linear in the observations\u2014builds on a sequence of results that progressively marry optimal control with robustness and distributional uncertainty. Kalman\u2019s foundational work establishes the LQG benchmark and the separation between estimation (Kalman filtering) and control. Jacobson (1973) and James\u2013Baras\u2013Elliott (1994) extend this paradigm to risk-sensitive and minimax settings, proving that under KL-type robustness, linear controllers and a separation principle persist even with partial observation. Hansen\u2013Sargent codify KL-based model uncertainty as a minimax control problem, further cementing linear structure under distributional misspecification.\n\nThe present work departs from relative-entropy ambiguity and embraces Wasserstein uncertainty to better capture data-driven, non-Gaussian deviations\u2014an approach made computationally viable by Esfahani\u2013Kuhn\u2019s duality and tractable reformulations for Wasserstein DRO. On the dynamic optimization side, Yang (2019) develops a general dynamic programming framework for Wasserstein-robust stochastic control, which the authors here specialize to linear\u2013quadratic systems with partial observations. Complementing these is the robust DP perspective from Xu\u2013Mannor on distributionally robust MDPs, guiding the minimax Bellman recursion under ambiguity. Together, these threads enable the paper\u2019s main theoretical advance\u2014preservation of linear optimality under Wasserstein ambiguity\u2014and the associated efficient computational scheme for robust LQG synthesis.",
