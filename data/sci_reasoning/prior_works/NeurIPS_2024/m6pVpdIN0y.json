  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution is to identify and elevate a neglected component of the Hessian\u2014the Nonlinear Modeling Error (NME)\u2014as the missing piece explaining why sharpness-aware methods like SAM succeed where gradient penalties and weight noise often fail. SAM (Foret et al.) and its theoretical analyses (Andriushchenko & Flammarion) largely operate through PSD curvature proxies, implicitly aligning with the Gauss\u2013Newton or Fisher viewpoint. Foundational second-order literature (Martens 2010; Martens & Grosse 2015) and the natural gradient framework (Amari 1998) entrenched the practice of replacing the full Hessian with PSD surrogates, which systematically omit indefinite curvature. Empirical Hessian studies at scale (Ghorbani et al.) revealed that deep networks\u2019 loss landscapes possess substantial non-PSD structure, hinting that the omitted component could be consequential. Classic regularization equivalences (Bishop 1995) that tie noise injection to gradient/Tikhonov penalties rely on linearization or PSD assumptions; the present work shows these equivalences break in modern deep nets because the NME drives activation-dependent and method-dependent behavior. By explicitly decomposing the Hessian into Gauss\u2013Newton and NME parts and tracing their distinct effects, the paper reconciles the empirical success of SAM with the mixed results of gradient penalties and weight noise, and clarifies the sensitivity of these methods to activation choices. This synthesis reframes sharpness regularization as fundamentally about which Hessian component is controlled, not merely the magnitude of curvature.",
