  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014diagnosing and tuning the frequency bias of state space models (SSMs)\u2014rests on two pillars: the LTI-SSM formulation and the broader theory of spectral bias. S4 established the modern LTI SSM architecture and its transfer-function view, giving a concrete handle for analyzing how SSM kernels respond across frequencies. HiPPO provided the standard initialization used in these models; the authors show this initialization effectively presets the model\u2019s spectral preference, thereby motivating an initialization-scaling mechanism to tune the inborn bias. In parallel, the spectral-bias literature (notably Rahaman et al.) demonstrated that neural networks tend to learn low-frequency components first, directly inspiring the authors to ask whether SSMs exhibit a similar bias and how to control it.\nTo change frequency sensitivity during training, the paper extends Sobolev training ideas by introducing a Sobolev-norm-based filter that reweights gradients in the frequency domain, thereby amplifying high-frequency learning when desired. Practical SSM baselines such as Mamba emphasize the importance of frequency control in state-space sequence modeling at scale and motivate evaluating tuning strategies within this family. Finally, frequency-domain reweighting methods from vision (e.g., focal frequency loss) provided a concrete precedent for manipulating spectral emphasis, informing the authors\u2019 decision to operate directly in the frequency domain\u2014here realized through gradient filtering rather than loss reshaping\u2014to strengthen, weaken, or even reverse SSMs\u2019 frequency bias.",
