  "synthesis_narrative": "The modern theory of margin-based generalization originates with fat-shattering analyses for linear separators, notably the radius\u2013margin framework of Shawe-Taylor, Bartlett, Williamson, and Anthony and Bartlett\u2019s margin sample-complexity results. These works fixed the structural dependence of risk on geometric margin, but did not completely resolve how the bound should scale\u2014simultaneously and sharply\u2014with sample size and failure probability. Subsequent advances in data-dependent complexity, especially Bartlett and Mendelson\u2019s Rademacher framework and localized complexities with Bartlett, Bousquet, and Mendelson, enabled sharper, high-probability bounds by tying error to empirical complexity at the achieved margin scale. In parallel, the margin-distribution viewpoint\u2014pioneered in boosting by Schapire et al. and formalized for general classifiers by Koltchinskii and Panchenko\u2014highlighted that the relevant quantity is not just a single margin but the fraction of points exceeding a margin threshold. PAC-Bayesian margin bounds (Langford and Shawe-Taylor) further clarified the optimal dependence on the failure probability. The NeurIPS 2025 paper synthesizes these strands for large-margin halfspaces and closes remaining gaps: it isolates the precise, asymptotically tight interplay among (i) the margin level, (ii) the fraction of training examples attaining that margin, (iii) the sample size, and (iv) the failure probability. By integrating margin-distribution control with localized, high-probability complexity analysis specialized to halfspaces, it matches upper and lower rates across all parameters, delivering the first bound that is tight in this full tradeoff.",
