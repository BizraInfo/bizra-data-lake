  "synthesis_narrative": "The Platonic Representation Hypothesis rests on a lineage that first defined how to compare representations and then repeatedly found empirical convergence. Representational Similarity Analysis (Kriegeskorte et al., 2008) provided the core framework\u2014compare representational dissimilarity matrices\u2014to assess whether different systems encode the same geometry. Building on this formulation, SVCCA (Raghu et al., 2017) and later CKA (Kornblith et al., 2019) offered robust, layerwise metrics that revealed meaningful alignment across independently trained networks, especially within vision. Li et al. (2016) crystallized the idea of \u201cconvergent learning,\u201d showing that different CNNs learn similar filters and features, directly motivating the paper\u2019s claim that modern models drift toward shared internal structure. Papyan et al. (2020) then uncovered Neural Collapse, a striking, task-level geometric convergence in the terminal training phase, which the present work cites as a concrete selective pressure toward a canonical geometry. On the cross-modal front, CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) demonstrated that explicit paired supervision can align language and vision spaces; the current paper\u2019s key advance is to show distances align across these modalities even without pairing as models scale, thereby addressing CLIP\u2019s reliance on supervision. Finally, unsupervised cross-lingual alignment (Conneau et al., 2018) offered a compelling precedent: independently trained embedding spaces can be linearly reconciled due to shared statistical structure. Together, these works directly enable and motivate the unifying claim that increasingly capable models converge toward a shared, platonic representation of reality.",
