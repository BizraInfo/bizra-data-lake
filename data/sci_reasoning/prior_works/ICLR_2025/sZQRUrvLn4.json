  "synthesis_narrative": "Message-passing GNNs were rigorously positioned by Xu et al. as no more expressive than the 1-WL color refinement, cementing their worst\u2011case inability to distinguish certain non\u2011isomorphic graphs and, by extension, to count many substructures. Morris et al. connected GNN expressivity to the full WL hierarchy and introduced higher\u2011order models, providing the formal ladder against which counting capabilities are assessed. Maron et al. then delivered higher\u2011order architectures that can provably count motifs, albeit at higher computational cost, demonstrating that counting is achievable with more expressive (but expensive) tensorized networks. In contrast, Bouritsas et al. proposed augmenting MPNNs with explicit subgraph features (GSN) to overcome counting limits, implying that plain message passing is insufficient in practice. On the algorithmic side, Alon, Yuster, and Zwick\u2019s color\u2011coding established dynamic programming schemes to detect/count bounded\u2011treewidth patterns, while Curticapean, Dell, and Marx showed subgraph counts can be expressed as linear combinations of homomorphism counts. Finally, Veli\u010dkovi\u0107 et al. argued GNNs can learn to execute classical dynamic programs, suggesting a route to algorithmically grounded GNN behaviors.\nTaken together, these works expose a tension: worst\u2011case limits versus practical algorithmic structure. The combination of WL\u2011based limits, homomorphism\u2011count decompositions, and DP schemes for restricted patterns suggests that counting may be tractable when graphs satisfy structural conditions. Building on this, the present paper crystallizes sufficient conditions under which message passing can both compute and learn subgraph counts, and designs dynamic programs whose operations align with MPNN updates\u2014showing that, beyond worst case, standard GNNs can often count substructures efficiently and sample\u2011efficiently.",
