  "synthesis_narrative": "Neural Assets builds on the latent diffusion paradigm, inheriting the powerful text-to-image interface and cross-attention machinery of Latent Diffusion Models while reinterpreting the token sequence as a conduit for non-text conditioning. Personalization works like Textual Inversion and DreamBooth establish that an object\u2019s identity can be encapsulated in learnable token embeddings from a few images, providing a blueprint for extracting per-object appearance representations. GLIGEN demonstrates that diffusion models can accept additional grounding tokens (e.g., regions/layout) alongside text without altering the overall interface; this inspires Neural Assets\u2019 decision to encode both visual appearance and 3D pose as a token sequence compatible with cross-attention.\n\nControlNet provides the core insight that structural signals (edges, depth, pose) can reliably steer diffusion generation. Neural Assets adopts this control philosophy but discretizes 3D pose into per-object tokens that pair with appearance tokens, enabling fine-grained, multi-object 3D pose manipulation. From the representation side, Slot Attention motivates modeling scenes as sets of object-centric slots and disentangling object factors, which Neural Assets operationalizes by encoding appearance from a reference frame while conditioning on target-frame poses. Finally, Zero-1-to-3 evidences that 2D diffusion models contain strong 3D priors and can be driven by viewpoint inputs, supporting Neural Assets\u2019 claim that per-object 3D pose tokens can yield 3D-aware, multi-object scene synthesis\u2014without abandoning the familiar text-to-image diffusion interface.",
