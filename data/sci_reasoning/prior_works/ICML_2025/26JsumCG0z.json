  "synthesis_narrative": "This paper sits at the intersection of prediction for public policy, welfare-centric fairness, and policy evaluation under constraints. The prediction-policy paradigm articulated by Kleinberg et al. anchors the central question: when and how does prediction improve public decision-making relative to baseline bureaucratic capacity? Translating this question into welfare terms, Kitagawa and Tetenov\u2019s empirical welfare maximization provides the blueprint for comparing policies under budget or capacity limits, while Athey and Wager supply robust tools to learn and evaluate targeting rules from observational data\u2014critical for the paper\u2019s real-world unemployment application.\n\nOn the equity objective\u2014identifying and prioritizing the worst-off\u2014the paper draws normative grounding from Heidari et al., who connect automated decisions to social-welfare criteria emphasizing protection of the least advantaged. Hashimoto et al. complement this by framing optimization around worst-case performance, aligning with the paper\u2019s focus on tail risks rather than averages. Obermeyer et al. caution that naive predictive targets can fail to surface those most in need, motivating the authors\u2019 careful, welfare-based target selection and evaluation.\n\nFinally, Perdomo et al.\u2019s performative prediction perspective informs the policy-aware modeling: predictions shape behaviors and outcomes in administrative systems, affecting the very distribution of need. Together, these works directly enable the paper\u2019s core contribution: analytical and empirical frameworks that quantify the welfare value of prediction, and benchmark it against expanding bureaucratic capacity, to help policymakers design systems that truly surface and serve the worst-off.",
