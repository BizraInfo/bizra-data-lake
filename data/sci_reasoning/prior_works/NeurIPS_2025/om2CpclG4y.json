  "synthesis_narrative": "C-MCTD\u2019s core contribution\u2014elevating diffusion-guided planning from local trajectory optimization to globally aware plan composition\u2014builds directly on three intertwined lines of prior work. First, it extends Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) by addressing the horizon and locality limits of trajectory-level search: rather than exploring within a single rollout, C-MCTD constructs and searches over compositions of subplans. This extension retains diffusion-based trajectory generation from Diffuser, using conditional denoising to propose and refine segments while enabling combinatorial recomposition. Second, C-MCTD\u2019s Online Composer relies on UCT to evaluate and expand nodes across a composition graph, transferring classical exploration\u2013exploitation principles from trajectory trees to higher-level compositional structures. To manage search complexity, the Distributed Composer draws from the parallel MCTS literature, distributing rollouts across multiple starting points and branches for broader, deeper coverage. Third, the Preplan Composer accelerates inference through cached plan graphs, combining GraphPlan\u2019s planning-graph abstraction (for pruning and reuse) with the PRM idea of precomputing reusable connectivity that can be rapidly queried at test time. Finally, the design of an archive of promising subplans and parallel exploration seeds resonates with Go-Explore\u2019s multi-start strategy, ensuring robust long-horizon discovery. Together, these influences enable globally coherent, extendable planning that composes and reuses subplans efficiently while preserving the strengths of diffusion-guided search.",
