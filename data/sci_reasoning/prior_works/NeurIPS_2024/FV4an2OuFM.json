  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper synthesizes three strands of prior work to deliver a principled method for conditioning non-linear diffusion processes directly in infinite-dimensional function spaces. First, the measure-theoretic and stochastic analysis backbone comes from Da Prato and Zabczyk\u2019s treatment of Hilbert-space SDEs and the infinite-dimensional Girsanov theorem, which enables rigorous change-of-measure arguments on path space. Complementing this, the classical time-reversal theory of diffusions (Haussmann\u2013Pardoux) clarifies how the score\u2014gradient of the log-density\u2014naturally appears in drift adjustments, anticipating the structural form of the conditioned SDE derived here. Second, recent advances in score-based generative modeling (Song et al.) operationalize this score-in-drift mechanism within SDEs; the present work extends that paradigm beyond finite-dimensional generative modeling to the conditioning of non-linear processes in infinite dimensions. To estimate the required score, the authors adopt Hyv\u00e4rinen\u2019s score matching, which allows learning without normalizing constants, and instantiate it after discretization in a chosen basis. Third, prior methods for conditioning diffusions via guided drifts (Schauer\u2013van der Meulen\u2013van Zanten) motivate the practical use of Girsanov-driven drift corrections, while Stuart\u2019s Bayesian function-space perspective justifies conditioning without prior discretization. The application to evolutionary shape time series exploits the elliptic Fourier descriptor framework (Kuhl\u2013Giardina) to represent function-valued shapes compactly, enabling practical score parameterization. Together, these works directly inform the paper\u2019s core contribution: a Girsanov-based, score-driven SDE formulation for conditioning non-linear, infinite-dimensional stochastic processes.",
