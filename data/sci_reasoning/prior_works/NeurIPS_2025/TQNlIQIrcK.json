  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core advance\u2014achieving a \u02dcO(1/N) optimality gap for degenerate homogeneous RMABs\u2014sits at the intersection of RMAB relaxations and diffusion-based stochastic control. Whittle\u2019s formulation of restless bandits and Lagrangian decoupling supplies the structural backbone enabling tractable per-arm analysis. Building on this, LP-based relaxations and fluid policies from Bertsimas and Ni\u00f1o-Mora established a powerful baseline that performs excellently under non-degeneracy, yet can stall at \u0398(1/\u221aN) gaps when degeneracies arise. The large-population, asymptotic perspective of Weber and Weiss motivates the homogeneous, many-arm setting where approximation-driven policies can be provably near-optimal.\n\nMethodologically, the paper\u2019s decisive step is to move beyond the fluid (LLN) approximation to a Gaussian (CLT/diffusion) approximation. Kurtz\u2019s limit theorems justify modeling occupancy fluctuations around the fluid trajectory as Gaussian, while Harrison\u2019s Brownian control program suggests that optimizing a diffusion surrogate can yield implementable policies with sharper performance guarantees. To operationalize this, the authors formulate and solve a stochastic program defined on the Gaussian system; Pr\u00e9kopa\u2019s stochastic programming foundations\u2014particularly for Gaussian uncertainties\u2014inform tractable reformulations and solution strategies. Finally, mean-field control insights from Gast and Gaujal clarify when fluid solutions are unique and how variance-aware corrections can systematically repair fluid-level degeneracies. Together, these strands directly enable the paper\u2019s SP-based Gaussian policy and its improved \u02dcO(1/N) gap in regimes where LP/fluid methods are insufficient.",
