  "synthesis_narrative": "HYPERION\u2019s core idea\u2014a unified hyperspherical space enabling fine-grained alignment on clients and geometric purification on the server\u2014sits at the intersection of angular metric learning and federated alignment/robustness. SphereFace and ArcFace established that constraining representations to the unit sphere with angular-margin losses delivers robust intra-class compactness and inter-class separation. HYPERION transposes these principles from images to graph embeddings, exploiting angular geometry to modulate edge-mediated message passing and to parse intra-class topological diversity. Prototypical Networks further contributed the notion of class-centric geometric anchors; HYPERION leverages prototype-like anchors on the hypersphere to coordinate class-wise alignment across heterogeneous clients.\n\nWithin federated learning, FedAvg provides the training substrate, while MOON\u2019s cosine-based representation alignment motivates HYPERION\u2019s angle-aware, client-side objectives that resist client drift in non-iid graph settings. At the server, robust aggregation via geometric median (Pillutla et al.) informs HYPERION\u2019s geometric-aware purification: instead of aggregating raw parameters, it filters noisy contributions in a manifold-aware way by operating on normalized, class-conditional spherical embeddings. Finally, Co-teaching\u2019s success in noisy-label regimes shaped HYPERION\u2019s philosophy of selective purification; yet, HYPERION operationalizes purification through angular consistency tests and hyperspherical statistics rather than small-loss heuristics. Together, these works directly inspire HYPERION\u2019s fine-grained hypersphere alignment to curb error propagation on graphs and its hyperspherical purification to mitigate undetected label noise, yielding a robust federated graph learning framework.",
