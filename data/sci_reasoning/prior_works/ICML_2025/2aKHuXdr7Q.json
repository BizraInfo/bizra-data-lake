  "synthesis_narrative": "UPGNET\u2019s core innovation\u2014an LDP-aware, three-stage pipeline for node features that enables deeper graph neural networks with improved utility\u2014emerges at the intersection of local privacy mechanisms and graph message passing. Foundational LDP works by Duchi et al. and Kairouz\u2013Oh\u2013Viswanath established the local privacy formalism, optimality insights, and trade-offs that govern any feature perturbation strategy. RAPPOR operationalized these principles into an encode\u2013perturb\u2013aggregate paradigm for high-dimensional categorical data; UPGNET explicitly generalizes this paradigm from single-vector collection to the graph setting, where perturbed node features subsequently propagate through neighborhoods. Hadamard Response provides an efficient high-dimensional LDP baseline but suffers utility loss that grows with feature dimension; UPGNET squarely addresses this limitation by analyzing and redesigning the perturbation/aggregation flow in the presence of graph propagation. On the graph-learning side, GraphSAGE\u2019s neighborhood sampling revealed that controlling neighborhood expansion is essential for scalable GNNs, a principle that DropEdge later sharpened to enable deeper models by reducing edges. UPGNET extends these ideas to the privacy regime: it identifies neighborhood size as a second, privacy-critical factor because each additional hop compounds LDP noise. Finally, insights from Li et al. on oversmoothing and depth limits motivate UPGNET\u2019s goal of \u201cgoing deeper\u201d under LDP, where noise amplification exacerbates classic depth issues. Together, these works directly shape UPGNET\u2019s dimension- and neighborhood-aware design for locally private, deeper GNNs.",
