  "synthesis_narrative": "Monarch Mixer\u2019s core idea is to replace quadratic attention and dense mixing with a single, learnable, sub\u2011quadratic, GEMM\u2011friendly structured matrix\u2014applied symmetrically across sequence and model dimensions. The architectural decision to decouple token and channel mixing is rooted in MLP\u2011Mixer, which established that competitive performance is possible when the same operator family is applied along each axis. FNet and Synthesizer further validated that global linear transforms\u2014whether fixed (Fourier) or learned\u2014can effectively substitute for attention, paving the way for a learned structured transform to handle token mixing at scale. On the mathematical and systems side, ACDC and Butterfly factorizations provided the key lineage for expressive structured matrices that approximate dense operators while enabling fast implementations with batched GEMMs/FFTs; Butterfly, in particular, demonstrated how a small number of structured factors can capture a wide class of linear transforms with sub\u2011quadratic cost. Finally, Linformer and Performer crystallized the community\u2019s pursuit of sub\u2011quadratic sequence scaling through low\u2011rank and kernel methods, respectively, setting performance and efficiency baselines that Monarch Mixer aims to match or exceed while unifying both token and channel mixing under a single structured\u2011matrix primitive. Together, these works directly inform Monarch Mixer\u2019s choice of a GEMM\u2011based, expressive structured matrix as the universal mixing building block, enabling sub\u2011quadratic scaling without sacrificing hardware efficiency.",
