  "synthesis_narrative": "Fitted Q Iteration established the reduction of value-function learning to supervised regression using batch data, with successive Bellman backups driving policy improvement. Finite-time analyses for fitted value iteration introduced concentrability-style distribution-mismatch terms to track how errors from off-policy data propagate through Bellman updates. Approximate Modified Policy Iteration unified value- and policy-iteration lenses, showing that partial evaluation\u2014performing only a limited number of backups before a greedy step\u2014can be both principled and effective. Conservative Policy Iteration provided the performance difference lemma linking advantage estimates to guaranteed improvement under distributional occupancy, a staple for proving safe gains from approximate value improvements. Reward-free exploration formalized a clean separation between exploration (data collection) and planning (learning/optimization) phases, suggesting that if one can ensure adequate coverage, planning can proceed with standard value-learning tools. Finally, the decision-estimation coefficient articulated an instance-dependent view of interactive learning complexity, encouraging parameters that capture when problems are empirically easier than worst-case analyses suggest.\nTaken together, these works pointed to a path: reduce RL to regression with partial evaluation; measure how errors propagate under the data distribution; and separate exploration from learning. The natural next step was to recognize that in many stochastic MDPs, the random policy induces enough mixing that only a few Bellman backups from the random policy\u2019s Q are needed. By formalizing this as an effective horizon and analyzing SQIRL\u2014random exploration plus limited fitted Q-iteration\u2014the paper replaces worst-case minimax requirements with an instance-dependent explanation for why deep RL with simple exploration often works.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) theory has largely focused on proving minimax sample complexity bounds. These require strategic exploration algorithms that use relatively limited function classes for representing the policy or value function. Our goal is to explain why deep RL algorithms often perform well in practice, despite using random exploration and much more expressive function classes like neural networks. Our work arrives at an explanation by showing that many stochastic MDPs can be solved by performing only a few steps of value iteration on the random policy\u2019s Q function and then acting greedily. When this is true, we find that it is possible to separate the exploration and learning components of RL, making it much easier to analyze. We introduce a new RL algorithm, SQIRL, that iteratively learns a near-optimal policy by exploring randomly to collect rollouts and then performing a limited number of steps of fitted-Q iteration over those roll- outs. We find that any regression alg",
