  "synthesis_narrative": "ShapeLLM-Omni\u2019s core innovation\u2014natively integrating 3D understanding and generation into a multimodal LLM\u2014rests on two pillars: discrete 3D tokenization and instruction-following multimodal alignment. On the representation side, VQ-VAE provides the essential mechanism to quantize continuous signals into discrete codes, which ShapeLLM-Omni adapts to 3D geometry via a dedicated 3D VQVAE. PolyGen established that 3D assets can be serialized and modeled autoregressively, directly motivating the choice to let an LLM operate over 3D token sequences. Complementing this, Point-BERT demonstrated the practicality of discrete codebooks and masked modeling on point clouds, informing ShapeLLM-Omni\u2019s tokenizer design and its 3D-centric pretraining/understanding tasks.\nOn the multimodal alignment side, 3D-LLM showed how to inject 3D knowledge into LLMs through instruction tuning, which ShapeLLM-Omni reinterprets in a native setup where 3D tokens are first-class citizens. LLaVA contributed the broader recipe of visual instruction tuning with GPT-assisted conversational data, which ShapeLLM-Omni extends to 3D. Alpaca\u2019s self-instruct paradigm underpins the construction of 3D-Alpaca, enabling scalable, diverse supervision covering generation, comprehension, and editing. Finally, GPT-4o\u2019s success with native multimodality provides the architectural and experiential target that ShapeLLM-Omni pursues\u2014unifying token interfaces so text and 3D can be interleaved and produced in any sequence. Together, these works directly inform ShapeLLM-Omni\u2019s discrete 3D tokenization, autoregressive modeling, and instruction-tuned, native multimodal training strategy.",
