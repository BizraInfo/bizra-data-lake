  "synthesis_narrative": "Pok\u00e9Champ\u2019s core innovation\u2014plugging zero-shot LLM modules into a principled minimax search to handle action proposal, opponent modeling, and value estimation under partial observability\u2014sits at the intersection of three lines of prior work. From the game-search perspective, AlphaZero established the power of combining tree search with learned policy priors and value functions. Pok\u00e9Champ mirrors this decomposition but replaces trained neural heads with promptable LLMs, leveraging their general knowledge to guide search without additional training. For imperfect-information reasoning, ReBeL and ISMCTS provided templates for searching over belief or information sets, showing how hidden information can be handled through structured search and opponent modeling. Pok\u00e9Champ adopts this stance by conditioning LLM judgments on gameplay history to implicitly form and exploit beliefs about the opponent\u2019s hidden choices.\nConcurrently, the LLM-agents literature demonstrated that language models can plan via search and benefit from history conditioning. Tree of Thoughts showed that LLMs can evaluate and expand branches in a deliberative tree, while ReAct emphasized using accumulated interaction history to inform next actions. Pok\u00e9Champ fuses these insights: the LLM proposes plausible actions, predicts opponent responses, and assigns value estimates to nodes in a minimax tree, all conditioned on rich battle context. Finally, domain-specific momentum came from PokeLLMon, which proved that LLMs can play competitive Pok\u00e9mon but lacked principled search and opponent modeling. By unifying these strands, Pok\u00e9Champ attains expert-level play with zero additional LLM training.",
