  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of Stochastic Interpolants with Data-Dependent Couplings is to formalize couplings in which the base sample is conditionally drawn given a target sample, and to show that the stochastic-interpolant regression objective still yields a simple square-loss estimator under these dependent couplings. This contribution sits at the intersection of continuous-time transport, diffusion-based generative modeling, and endpoint coupling paradigms.\nNeural ODEs established learning continuous-time maps for generative modeling, while Benamou\u2013Brenier provided the foundational dynamical transport view. Diffusion models (DDPM) and the SDE formulation of score-based generative modeling recast synthesis as time-indexed stochastic transports from a simple base toward data, enabling regression-style training of dynamics. Albergo, Boffi, and Vanden-Eijnden\u2019s stochastic interpolants unified flows and diffusions and showed that vector fields can be learned with a straightforward square-loss in the standard (independent) coupling setting. In parallel, Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge methods emphasized endpoint couplings between base and target, offering conditional generation via entropic OT but often requiring more complex iterative solvers.\nThe present paper draws these threads together: it adopts the stochastic interpolant lens and extends it to data-dependent couplings, thereby enabling conditional generative models where the base is coupled with the target, yet preserving the simplicity of the regression learning rule. Conceptually it inherits the dynamic transport perspective, the continuous-time diffusion/flow machinery, and the importance of endpoint couplings, while providing a practical and theoretically clean route to conditionally trained transports without the overhead of bridge-solving procedures.",
