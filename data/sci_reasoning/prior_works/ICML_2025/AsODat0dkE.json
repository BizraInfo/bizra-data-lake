  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation\u2014formulating watermark evasion as an explicit objective and then using preference-based optimization to train adaptive, cost\u2011effective attacks\u2014stands on two pillars: modern LLM watermarking and rigorous adversarial robustness evaluation. Kirchenbauer et al.\u2019s greenlist watermark and log-likelihood-ratio detector provide the concrete mechanism and statistic that this work targets, serving as the primary baseline and the objective to minimize. From adversarial ML, Athalye et al. establish that robustness claims require adaptive, method-aware attacks rather than non-adaptive probes; this paper directly imports that standard into watermarking. The optimization framing closely follows Carlini & Wagner\u2019s objective-based attack design, balancing attack success with a fidelity constraint\u2014here, minimizing detection while preserving output quality.\nTo make such attacks practical in the black-box, no\u2011gradient regime of watermark detectors, the authors extend the spirit of ZOO\u2019s zeroth-order, query-efficient optimization. They further observe cross-watermark transferability of optimized attacks, an effect predicted by Papernot et al.\u2019s findings on adversarial example transfer, and leverage it by training against one scheme to generalize to others. The second pillar is preference-driven optimization: inspired by RLHF (Ouyang et al.), they obtain pairwise quality signals to steer attack search without degrading content, and concretely instantiate a DPO-style objective (Rafailov et al.) for sample-efficient, reward-free tuning. Together, these works directly shape the paper\u2019s method: adaptive, optimization-based, preference-guided attacks that robustly and cost-effectively defeat contemporary LLM watermarks.",
