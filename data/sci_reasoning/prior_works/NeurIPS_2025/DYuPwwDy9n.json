  "synthesis_narrative": "This paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014introducing a Bayesian value function for prediction-aware control and analyzing a Bellman\u2013Jensen Gap\u2014sits at the nexus of three mature threads. From Bayesian RL, Duff\u2019s Bayes-adaptive MDPs provide the blueprint for evaluating policies under model uncertainty; here, uncertainty is over multi-step transition predictions rather than entire kernels, yielding a value function defined on predictive distributions that avoids explicit state expansion. The predictive-state perspective of Littman\u2013Sutton\u2013Singh offers the conceptual lever to treat future forecasts as sufficient statistics, motivating a compact representation despite high-dimensional multi-step inputs.\n\nOn the analysis side, classical model-error-to-value-error bounds (Kearns\u2013Singh) and robust MDPs (Iyengar) establish how Bellman operators transmit uncertainty; the present work generalizes these ideas by leveraging convexity and Jensen\u2019s inequality to quantify the optimism introduced when replacing stochastic predictive rollouts with their summaries, producing the Bellman\u2013Jensen Gap. This gap functions analogously to the penalty terms in information relaxation (Brown\u2013Smith\u2013Sun), which formalize the value of lookahead information\u2014here instantiated as imperfect, partially action-covered forecasts\u2014while ensuring non-anticipativity in the resulting guarantees.\n\nFinally, concerns about compounding model error in multi-step planning (Janner et al.) directly motivate the need for principled controls on forecast usage. By casting forecasts as distributions and operating on a Bayesian value, the paper inherits the sample-efficiency and structural benefits seen in contextual/low-Bellman-rank settings (Jiang et al.), achieving tractability without exponential state augmentation while delivering tight, interpretable bounds under imperfect predictions.",
