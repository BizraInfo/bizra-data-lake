  "synthesis_narrative": "OPEN\u2019s central contribution\u2014meta-learning a policy update rule that explicitly addresses non-stationarity, plasticity loss, and exploration\u2014emerges at the intersection of learned optimization, meta-RL, and stabilization/exploration techniques in modern RL. The learned optimizer foundation of Andrychowicz et al. established that update rules themselves can be trainable, which OPEN extends to reinforcement learning by conditioning on RL-specific signals and emitting structured updates. RL^2 showed that meta-learned algorithms can implement sophisticated exploration and adaptation, a capability OPEN leverages by allowing its learned update to control stochasticity for exploration. Meta-Gradient Reinforcement Learning demonstrated that meta-learning can tune components of RL updates (e.g., entropy coefficients, discounting) in response to non-stationary return signals; OPEN generalizes this idea by learning the entire update rule informed by these signals.\nStability and plasticity are addressed by importing trust-region principles from PPO, encouraging small, KL-aware policy shifts that prevent catastrophic loss of plasticity. For exploration, OPEN integrates insights from NoisyNets and maximum-entropy RL (SAC), enabling the learned optimizer to adaptively modulate stochasticity and entropy pressure, thereby avoiding premature convergence. Finally, handling non-stationary data distributions is informed by off-policy correction methods like Retrace, motivating OPEN\u2019s use of importance-related features to make robust updates under shifting behavior policies. Collectively, these strands culminate in a flexible, meta-trained update rule whose inputs and outputs are deliberately structured to encode prior best practices while retaining the adaptability of learned optimization.",
