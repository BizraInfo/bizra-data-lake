  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core advance\u2014identifying linear causal representations from general environments up to the intrinsic surrounded-node ambiguity (SNA), and providing a provable algorithm (LiNGCReL)\u2014rests on three converging lines of prior work. First, LiNGAM (Shimizu et al., 2006) established that linear, non-Gaussian acyclic models are identifiable, giving the methodological backbone for recovering linear causal structure. The new work adapts LiNGAM\u2019s identifiability tools to a latent-variable setting with linear mixing, where only observed mixtures are available across environments. Second, the multi-environment identifiability paradigm (Khemakhem et al., 2020; Peters et al., 2016) shows that exogenous variation across environments\u2014whether framed as auxiliary variables (iVAE) or invariances (ICP)\u2014can unlock identification otherwise impossible from a single environment. The present paper brings these ideas to the latent causal setting with linear mixing, using cross-environment changes as signal while formalizing the precise limit of what can be recovered. Third, the literature on interventions with unknown targets (Eaton & Murphy, 2007) motivates the paper\u2019s \u2018general environments\u2019 assumption, where interventions or shifts are present but unspecified, aligning with realistic data collection. Finally, the impossibility of unsupervised disentanglement (Locatello et al., 2019) and the SNA concept (Varici et al., 2023) set the theoretical boundary: without additional structure and environments, recovery is impossible; even with them, SNA remains. The paper\u2019s contribution is to match this boundary\u2014proving identifiability up to SNA in the linear case and delivering an algorithm that achieves it.",
