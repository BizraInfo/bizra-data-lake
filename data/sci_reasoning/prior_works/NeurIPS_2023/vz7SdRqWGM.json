  "synthesis_narrative": "Duong, Simoncelli, Chklovskii, and Lipshutz unite two long-standing efficient-coding mechanisms\u2014synaptic plasticity\u2013based decorrelation and gain-control\u2013based normalization\u2014into a single multi-timescale model for adaptive whitening. The efficient-coding objective of whitening articulated by Atick and Redlich defines the target transformation, while Oja and F\u00f6ldi\u00e1k provide concrete local synaptic rules for learning principal components and reducing output correlations, framing the slow-learning substrate that captures invariant statistical structure. In parallel, Schwartz and Simoncelli\u2019s normative derivations of divisive normalization, together with Carandini and Heeger\u2019s synthesis of normalization as a canonical neural computation, establish rapid gain modulation as a principled means to equalize response variance and suppress dependencies on short timescales. Empirical demonstrations of fast contrast-dependent rescaling by Brenner, Bialek, and de Ruyter van Steveninck further justify treating gain as a quick, context-sensitive parameter. Finally, Turrigiano\u2019s work on homeostatic synaptic plasticity anchors the idea that synapses adapt more slowly to stabilize function and encode persistent structure.\n\nBuilding on these strands, the NeurIPS 2023 paper contributes a normative, mechanistic framework that assigns complementary roles to different timescales: fast gain modulation tracks the current statistical context to normalize responses, while slow synaptic plasticity learns the stable components of input correlations. This resolves limitations of single-substrate models\u2014gain-only approaches that forget structure and plasticity-only approaches that adapt too slowly\u2014by deriving coupled update rules from a multi-timescale objective that achieves robust, context-aware whitening under nonstationary sensory statistics.",
