  "synthesis_narrative": "MindEye\u2019s core contribution\u2014specializing parallel modules for retrieval (contrastive fMRI\u2192CLIP) and reconstruction (diffusion prior conditioned on the same embedding)\u2014emerges from two converging lines of work. First, early brain decoding showed that visual representations decoded from fMRI can support identification and reconstruction. Horikawa and Kamitani introduced decoding into deep feature spaces to retrieve stimuli, and Shen et al. advanced this by coupling decoded features with a learned generative prior to synthesize images. MindEye inherits both ideas but unifies them in a single multimodal target space.\nThe second line is the modern multimodal\u2013generative stack. CLIP provided a semantically rich, contrastively trained image embedding that aligns vision and language; MindEye exploits this by training an fMRI encoder to land directly in CLIP image space, which yields powerful zero-shot retrieval and a standardized interface to generation. Latent diffusion established a scalable, high-fidelity generative prior, and unCLIP demonstrated that diffusion models can accept CLIP image embeddings as conditioning variables. This directly enables MindEye\u2019s diffusion-prior arm: once brain signals are mapped to CLIP space, a pre-trained unCLIP-style decoder can reconstruct the corresponding image.\nFinally, Takagi and Nishimoto validated that latent diffusion can be driven by brain-derived features, while the Natural Scenes Dataset supplied the large, naturalistic supervision needed to learn fine-grained, image-specific brain-to-embedding mappings. Together, these works crystallize in MindEye\u2019s dual-path design that achieves both precise retrieval and high-quality reconstruction from fMRI.",
