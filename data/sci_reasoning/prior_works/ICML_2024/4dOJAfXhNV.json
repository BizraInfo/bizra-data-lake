  "synthesis_narrative": "SAPG\u2019s core contribution\u2014splitting massive parallel rollouts into policy-chunks and fusing them with principled importance sampling\u2014sits at the intersection of on-policy policy gradients and distributed RL. PPO supplied the dominant on-policy surrogate objective using importance ratios, but in the GPU-era PPO saturates when simply increasing the number of parallel environments. A3C/A2C first demonstrated that parallel actors can accelerate training, yet they provided no principled mechanism to neutralize policy staleness as concurrency grows. IMPALA addressed large-scale actor\u2013learner decoupling with V-trace corrections, establishing that experience generated under slightly different behavior policies can be aggregated effectively, albeit with truncated, biased corrections optimized for stability. ACER further advanced the use of importance sampling and bias correction for policy gradients, clarifying how to safely reuse off-policy data. These algorithmic threads rest on the off-policy policy-gradient theory of Degris et al., which formalizes how importance weights recover the correct gradient under behavior\u2013target mismatch.\n\nSAPG fuses these insights: it preserves an on-policy PPO-style update while explicitly partitioning data into chunks produced under slightly different policies and then aggregates their contributions with importance sampling grounded in off-policy PG theory. Crucially, this design targets the GPU-simulation setting exemplified by Isaac Gym, where throughput is abundant but conventional on-policy learners underutilize it. By correcting staleness across chunks rather than ignoring or truncating it, SAPG achieves scalable, high-throughput on-policy learning without the performance saturation typical of PPO at large parallelism.",
