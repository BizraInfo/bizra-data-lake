  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper advances a long-standing goal: a sharp, dimension-based understanding of realizable regression in both PAC and online settings. It starts from the classical foundation of Alon\u2013Ben-David\u2013Cesa-Bianchi\u2013Haussler, who introduced fat-shattering and proved it sufficient for PAC learnability of real-valued classes. Simon (SICOMP \u201997) broadened this agenda with generalized dimensions and partial necessity results, but left a gap between sufficiency (fat-shattering) and a complete characterization, especially in the realizable regime.\n\nThe authors resolve this by importing and extending powerful ideas from multiclass classification. Daniely\u2013Sabato\u2013Shalev-Shwartz showed that ERM learnability in the realizable multiclass setting is governed by the graph dimension; this paper identifies an analogous combinatorial dimension for real-valued predictors that precisely captures ERM learnability under realizability. Further, inspired by Daniely\u2013Shalev-Shwartz\u2019s instance-optimal program and their DS dimension (a necessary condition conjectured to be sufficient), the authors propose a DS-related necessary condition for realizable regression and conjecture its sufficiency, mirroring the multiclass narrative.\n\nOn the algorithmic side, the paper\u2019s minimax instance-optimal learner for realizable regression echoes the one-inclusion/minimax philosophy behind optimal multiclass learners and the Littlestone paradigm in online realizable binary classification. Finally, for the online setting with real-valued predictions, the work is anchored in the sequential complexity framework of Rakhlin\u2013Sridharan\u2013Tewari, aligning dimension-based characterizations with minimax rates. Together, these threads yield a unified, near-complete picture of realizable regression learnability and optimal algorithms.",
