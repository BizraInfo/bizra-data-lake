  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014demonstrating that Adam\u2019s near-optimal behavior for transformer language models is largely preserved when the momentum hyperparameters are tied (\u03b21 = \u03b22), and that signed-gradient/momentum simplifications fall short\u2014emerges from a lineage of works parsing Adam\u2019s mechanics. Kingma and Ba\u2019s Adam established the two-moment structure (\u03b21, \u03b22), while RMSProp provided the second-moment normalization that Adam augments with momentum. Analyses like Balles and Hennig\u2019s dissected Adam into sign, magnitude, and variance components, motivating rigorous tests of signed-gradient and signed-momentum surrogates. The signSGD line made these signed updates concrete and influential baselines; the present study\u2019s finding that they consistently underperform Adam, even with careful tuning and clipping, isolates what mere sign-based updates miss. Concurrently, theoretical scrutiny from Reddi et al. clarified the stability role of second-moment tracking, foreshadowing that controlling how first and second moments interact could yield principled, stable variants. Momentum-focused Adam extensions such as Nadam underscored that subtle momentum design choices materially affect adaptive updates. Finally, AdamW\u2019s ubiquity in transformer training situates the empirical stakes and validates that the \u03b21 = \u03b22 constraint competes under standard practices. Together, these threads directly inform the paper\u2019s insight: Adam\u2019s \u201csecret sauce\u201d is the specific coupling of momentum and variance normalization\u2014which can be preserved and made more analyzable by equating \u03b21 and \u03b22.",
