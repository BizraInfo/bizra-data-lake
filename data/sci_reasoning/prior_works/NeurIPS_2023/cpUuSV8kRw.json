  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014defining and achieving group fairness in peer review via a core-style notion that prevents any community from benefiting by seceding\u2014sits at the intersection of cooperative game theory and modern reviewer assignment systems. The intellectual backbone is the core from cooperative game theory, pioneered by Shapley and Shubik (1971), which formalizes coalition-proof outcomes in assignment markets. Shapley and Scarf (1974) further cement the algorithmic and existential underpinnings of core allocations in one-sided matching, offering TTC-like insights that motivate existence and efficient computation in discrete allocation settings. Complementing these, Gale and Shapley (1962) and the Roth\u2013Sotomayor monograph (1990) supply the stability framework and its generalizations to capacity-constrained (many-to-many) environments, which closely mirror peer review where each paper requires multiple reviews and reviewers have limited load. On the application side, Charlin and Zemel\u2019s TPMS (2013) provides the prevailing similarity-based modeling and optimization template for large-scale conferences, the substrate on which fairness constraints must operate. Building on this, PeerReview4All (Stelmakh, Shah, Singh, 2019) demonstrates that fairness can be formalized and algorithmically guaranteed in reviewer assignment; the present paper advances this line by elevating fairness from individual or worst-case protection to coalition (community) robustness, translating core-style guarantees into the peer-review context and delivering both existence and efficient algorithms under a realistic assignment model.",
