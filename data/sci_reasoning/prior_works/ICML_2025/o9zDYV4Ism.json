  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of this paper is a non-linear, regime-aware analysis of LoRA\u2019s loss landscape and training dynamics, showing that training typically converges to low-rank global minima and explaining why zero-initialization plus weight decay biases solutions toward that favorable region. The original LoRA paper by Hu et al. defines the exact parameterization (rank-factored residual updates initialized at zero) and training practice that this work scrutinizes, serving as both the baseline and problem formulation. Prior theoretical treatments of LoRA have often relied on linearization, conceptually rooted in the Neural Tangent Kernel (Jacot et al.), which the authors formalize as a \u2018special regime\u2019 and explicitly move beyond to analyze a more realistic \u2018generic regime.\u2019 The paper\u2019s implicit bias argument draws directly on matrix-factorization theory, especially Gunasekar et al., which shows gradient methods on factorized parametrizations with L2-type regularization prefer low-norm/low-rank solutions\u2014precisely the mechanism the authors identify for LoRA under zero-init and weight decay. Geometric analyses of low-rank nonconvex problems (Bhojanapalli et al.; Ge et al.) provide the blueprint for benign landscapes and strict-saddle properties, enabling the paper\u2019s global-minimum-or-high-rank-large-magnitude dichotomy (\u2018fails loudly\u2019). Finally, insights from deep linear network landscapes (Kawaguchi) contextualize when linearized behavior is expected, helping to articulate the boundary between the special (linearization-valid) and generic regimes that structure the paper\u2019s results.",
