  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014robust generalized fMRI-to-image reconstruction by explicitly addressing the semantic gap\u2014sits at the intersection of three lines of work. First, prior brain-decoding studies showed that decoding into intermediate neural network feature spaces enables generalization beyond seen categories. Horikawa and Kamitani established the zero-shot potential of decoding hierarchical DNN features, and Shen et al. demonstrated that such decoded features can drive high-fidelity image reconstruction. Complementing this, Naselaris et al. revealed that low-level structural information (e.g., edges, orientations) is reliably represented in early visual cortex, motivating a structure-first fallback when high-level semantics are uncertain. Second, modern generative priors dramatically improved reconstructions: Takagi and Nishimoto leveraged latent diffusion models, showing that mapping fMRI to semantic/visual embeddings can steer powerful generative models. ControlNet further formalized how structural conditions like edges or depth can be injected into diffusion, offering a blueprint for structure-guided synthesis. Third, CLIP provided a compact, discriminative, and zero-shot-capable semantic space. By projecting training stimuli into CLIP\u2019s embedding, the present work densifies sparse training semantics, quantifies test-time semantic proximity, and calibrates reconstruction accordingly. Finally, uncertainty modeling principles from Kendall and Gal support the paper\u2019s strategy to weight semantic versus structural cues based on estimated semantic uncertainty. Together, these works directly inform the paper\u2019s design: CLIP-based semantic densification and uncertainty-aware gating paired with structurally guided reconstruction to handle both near- and far-from-training semantic regimes.",
