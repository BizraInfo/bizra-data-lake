  "synthesis_narrative": "SOFO sits at the intersection of two lines of work: forward-mode training of recurrent networks and curvature-aware second-order optimization. Williams and Zipser\u2019s RTRL established that RNN sensitivities can be propagated forward in time without backpropagation, while Werbos\u2019s BPTT, despite being the default, exposes severe memory and horizon limitations that are especially constraining in neuroscience applications. Building on this forward-mode perspective, UORO showed that scalable, online approximations to forward-mode gradients are possible, validating the practicality of forward-in-time sensitivity propagation as an alternative computational primitive to reverse-mode.\nIn parallel, the second-order literature demonstrated how curvature information alleviates ill-conditioning in RNNs. Pearlmutter introduced efficient Hessian\u2013vector products as the core operation for second-order methods, avoiding explicit Hessian formation. Martens and Sutskever applied Hessian-free/Gauss\u2013Newton techniques to RNNs, showing that curvature-aware updates dramatically improve optimization on tough sequence problems. Amari\u2019s natural gradient provided a unifying geometric view of curvature-preconditioned updates.\nSOFO synthesizes these strands: it forgoes backpropagation and instead performs batched forward-mode differentiation to obtain the directional derivatives needed to build curvature-vector products, enabling second-order updates that are memory-light and parallelizable over long time horizons. Motivated by Pascanu et al.\u2019s analysis of exploding/vanishing gradients and ill-conditioning, SOFO targets vanilla RNNs common in neuroscience, preserving biological plausibility constraints while delivering the stabilization benefits of second-order optimization.",
