  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core advances\u2014sampling, efficient probability computation, and active parameter estimation for a generalized top-k Mallows model\u2014build directly on three pillars: the Mallows/Kendall exponential family, algorithms for partial/incomplete preferences, and active ranking. Mallows (1957) provides the probabilistic backbone, while Fligner and Verducci (1986) contribute the repeated-insertion representation of Mallows distributions that the authors adapt to truncated, top-k contexts to obtain a specialized sampler. Meil\u0103 et al. (2007) develop normalization and dynamic-programming style inference for the Mallows family, furnishing the combinatorial and analytic tools that are extended here to compute choice probabilities for top-k events efficiently. Fagin, Kumar, and Sivakumar (2003) formalize top-k lists and distances over truncated rankings, shaping the definition and handling of indifference beyond the top-k in the authors\u2019 generalized model.\nLu and Boutilier (2011) show how to learn and perform inference with Mallows from partial information, which directly informs both the paper\u2019s probability computations under incomplete choice data and its estimation routines. For parameter learning, Azari Soufiani et al. (2013) provide methodological and identifiability insights for Mallows-type estimation that undergird the paper\u2019s statistical analysis. Finally, Jamieson and Nowak (2011) supply the active-ranking paradigm\u2014query-efficient strategies and sample-complexity reasoning\u2014that the authors tailor to the Mallows-top-k setting, yielding an active learning algorithm that focuses queries on the most informative comparisons within buyers\u2019 top choice sets.",
