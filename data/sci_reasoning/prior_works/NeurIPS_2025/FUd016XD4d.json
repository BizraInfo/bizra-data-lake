  "synthesis_narrative": "Latent Policy Barrier (LPB) reframes robustness in visuomotor imitation as an in-distribution control problem. The paper\u2019s core idea\u2014treating expert latent embeddings as a safety set and using a learned dynamics model to minimally correct actions at inference\u2014draws theoretical grounding from Control Barrier Functions (Ames et al., 2017), which formalize safe sets and minimal interventions. Practically, LPB adopts the runtime safety-filter paradigm (Wabersich & Zeilinger, 2021), replacing hard-coded constraints with a learned latent barrier and using a predictive model to certify and adjust actions on-the-fly. Its architectural decoupling of precise imitation and recovery echoes Recovery RL (Thananjeyan et al., 2021), which separates task execution from near-boundary correction using a dedicated recovery mechanism trained on off-nominal experience.\nAt the policy level, LPB stands on the diffusion-based visuomotor backbone introduced by Diffusion Policy (Chi et al., 2023), ensuring high-fidelity imitation on expert data. To keep sampling constrained, LPB extends the behavior-regularization ethos of offline RL\u2014exemplified by BCQ (Fujimoto et al., 2019)\u2014from action-space support constraints to a latent-state barrier around expert trajectories. Finally, its inference-time guidance of a generative policy by a learned model parallels Diffuser (Janner et al., 2022), but channels this mechanism toward staying in-distribution rather than reward improvement. Together, these strands replace human-in-the-loop aggregation (DAgger) with a principled, learned safety barrier in latent space, yielding robust visuomotor control that preserves expert-like behavior while recovering from OOD deviations.",
