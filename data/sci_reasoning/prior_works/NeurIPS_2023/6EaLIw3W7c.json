  "synthesis_narrative": "LinkerNet\u2019s core innovation\u2014co-designing fragment poses and a 3D linker via an E(3)-equivariant diffusion process\u2014builds directly on three converging lines of prior work. First, fragment-linking methods such as DeLinker formalized the task but assumed pre-positioned fragments, motivating a model that can handle unknown relative poses. DiffLinker advanced the methodology by introducing E(3)-equivariant diffusion to generate 3D linkers conditioned on fixed fragment coordinates; LinkerNet explicitly generalizes DiffLinker\u2019s conditional generation to the harder joint problem of pose inference and linker construction.\nSecond, recent progress on equivariant diffusion and architectures made such a joint model feasible. E(n) Equivariant Diffusion Models provided the principled framework for noise schedules and score matching in Euclidean coordinates with strict equivariance, while EGNN and SE(3)-Transformers supplied practical, expressive equivariant backbones to predict coordinate and pose updates without breaking symmetry.\nThird, DiffDock showed how to perform diffusion over rigid-body SE(3) poses and internal torsions when the pose is unknown, a blueprint that LinkerNet adapts to multi-fragment systems. LinkerNet\u2019s Newton\u2013Euler-inspired module for fragment pose updates recasts fragments as rigid bodies with learned force/torque-like updates, marrying DiffDock\u2019s pose-diffusion insight with EGNN-style coordinate dynamics. Together, these works directly informed LinkerNet\u2019s unified, equivariant generative process that simultaneously resolves fragment placement and synthesizes chemically plausible 3D linkers.",
