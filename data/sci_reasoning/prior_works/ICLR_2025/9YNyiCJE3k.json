  "synthesis_narrative": "OSDA Agent\u2019s core contribution\u2014an interactive LLM agent that plans, proposes, and validates organic structure-directing agents using computational chemistry tools\u2014rests on two converging lineages. From the zeolite community, Daeyaert et al. formalized the OSDA design problem as host\u2013guest optimization with docking and binding-energy scoring. This defined both the targets and evaluators that OSDA Agent now calls programmatically in a closed loop. From the AI side, ReAct established the reasoning\u2013acting loop for LLMs, and Toolformer showed how models can initiate tool calls, together motivating OSDA Agent\u2019s Actor/Planner to decompose design goals and selectively invoke docking, force-field, or physicochemical calculators. SELFIES enabled robust text-based molecule generation, directly addressing the paper\u2019s stated issue of LLM controllability by ensuring validity during edits and exploration. In contrast, conventional molecular generators such as REINVENT (deep RL) and Junction Tree VAE (structured generative modeling) serve as the baselines whose limitations\u2014single-function, non-interactive search without grounded physical feedback\u2014OSDA Agent overcomes by integrating live evaluators and iterative reasoning. Finally, Reflexion\u2019s self-critique paradigm is extended to chemistry: OSDA Agent operationalizes reflection via evaluator feedback (binding energies, steric/charge constraints) to refine proposals over multi-step trajectories. Together, these works directly shaped the OSDA Agent\u2019s problem framing, agent architecture, molecular representation, and evaluation-driven refinement cycle.",
