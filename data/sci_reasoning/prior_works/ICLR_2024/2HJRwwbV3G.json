  "synthesis_narrative": "Early evidence that language models store retrievable factual associations came from cloze-style probing, where parameters appeared to encode facts that could be recalled without explicit databases. Complementing this, work on the internal mechanics of transformers argued that feed-forward layers act as key\u2013value memories, suggesting a concrete locus and mechanism by which such associations are represented. Building on these ideas, the knowledge neuron line of work operationalized the thesis by proposing methods to localize and directly edit neurons thought to store facts in MLP modules. Concurrently, causal intervention approaches such as ROME introduced precise weight-editing procedures targeting MLP key\u2013value pairs, alongside factual evaluation resources like CounterFact, and later scaled to mass editing via MEMIT. Factual QA datasets such as ZSRE standardized how to measure whether an edit succeeds or generalizes, while BLiMP\u2019s minimal-pair diagnostics provided controlled probes of formal grammatical competence across many syntactic phenomena. Together, these works supplied both the mechanistic hypothesis\u2014that MLPs store factual knowledge\u2014and the toolchain and benchmarks for intervening and evaluating edits. The natural open question, given the causal-editing tools and linguistic diagnostics, was whether the same MLP-targeted edits that alter factual recall are specific to \u201cknowledge\u201d or instead modulate broader linguistic competence. This paper synthesizes the editing protocols with syntactic evaluations to reveal that identical interventions systematically affect non-factual linguistic behavior, exposing a central limitation in the knowledge-neuron thesis and reframing what these edits truly control.",

    "abstract": "We reassess the Knowledge Neuron (KN) Thesis: an interpretation of the mechanism underlying the ability of large language models to recall facts from a training corpus. This nascent thesis proposes that facts are recalled from the training corpus through the MLP weights in a manner resembling key-value memory, implying in effect that \"knowledge\" is stored in the network. Furthermore, by modifying the MLP modules, one can control the language model's generation of factual information. The plausibility of the KN thesis has been demonstrated by the success of KN-inspired model editing methods (Dai et al., 2022; Meng et al., 2022).\n\nWe find that this thesis is, at best, an oversimplification. Not only have we found that we can edit the expression of certain linguistic phenomena using the same model editing methods but, through a more comprehensive evaluation, we have found that the KN thesis does not adequately explain the process of factual expression.
