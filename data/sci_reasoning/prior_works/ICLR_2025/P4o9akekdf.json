  "synthesis_narrative": "NoPoSplat\u2019s core idea\u2014pose-free, feed-forward 3D Gaussian reconstruction trained solely with photometric loss\u2014stands on two converging lines of work. First, Kerbl et al. introduced 3D Gaussian Splatting as a real-time, differentiable scene representation; NoPoSplat directly predicts these primitives and learns via the same photometric supervision. Second, feed-forward neural rendering from sparse views (pixelNeRF, MVSNeRF) defined the paradigm of conditioning on a set of images at training and inference, obviating test-time optimization; NoPoSplat adopts this paradigm but outputs 3D Gaussians rather than radiance fields. A separate lineage in pose-free neural rendering (NeRF--, BARF) highlighted that jointly optimizing camera poses with radiance fields is feasible but computation-heavy and sensitive to pose errors\u2014precisely the gap NoPoSplat addresses by dispensing with global poses altogether. For doing so robustly, two ideas are key: image-centric canonicalization and camera-aware conditioning. MASt3R showed that anchoring geometry in per-image coordinate frames enables unposed multi-view reconstruction, inspiring NoPoSplat\u2019s choice to anchor all predictions to one input view\u2019s camera frame. SRT further demonstrated the power of view tokens (including camera parameters) for geometry-free novel view synthesis; NoPoSplat extends this by converting camera intrinsics to explicit token embeddings to resolve scale ambiguity. Together, these works directly enable NoPoSplat\u2019s main innovation: a simple, real-time, pose-free pipeline that reconstructs accurate 3D Gaussians from sparse unposed images.",
