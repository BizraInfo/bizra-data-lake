  "synthesis_narrative": "The core contribution analyzes diffusion-model sampling from a nonparametric, large-sample perspective and proves near-minimax optimality without density lower bound assumptions. This rests on the score-based diffusion formulation of Song et al., which frames generation as reversing an SDE with drift equal to the score of Gaussian-smoothed data; DDPM provides the practical baseline instantiation. The statistical heart of the analysis is score estimation for p0 convolved with a Gaussian. Hyv\u00e4rinen\u2019s score matching and Vincent\u2019s denoising\u2013score connection establish that, under Gaussian corruption, score learning is equivalent to denoising/regression. Efron\u2019s Tweedie formula makes this explicit by expressing the smoothed-score \u2207 log(p0 * N(0, tI)) in terms of a conditional expectation, which the paper estimates using a kernel regression (Nadaraya\u2013Watson) estimator. This choice enables sharp, distribution-agnostic MSE bounds for the score under merely sub-Gaussian tails. Finally, Tsybakov\u2019s nonparametric minimax theory provides the rate benchmarks and the bias\u2013variance lens to interpret the diffusion time t as a smoothing/bandwidth parameter; choosing t via early stopping balances approximation (heat-flow bias) and estimation error to achieve near-minimax generation error (up to logs) for Sobolev smoothness \u03b2 \u2264 2. Together, these works directly shape the paper\u2019s kernel-based score estimator, the TV error propagation over the reverse SDE, and the early-stopping strategy that yields minimax-optimal sampling rates.",
