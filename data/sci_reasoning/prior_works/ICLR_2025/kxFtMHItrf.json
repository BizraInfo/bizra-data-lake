  "synthesis_narrative": "Reti-Diff\u2019s core contribution\u2014learning Retinex-aware priors with a latent diffusion model and using them to guide a transformer-based restoration network\u2014emerges from two converging lines of prior work. First, Retinex theory (Land & McCann) and its practical instantiations in enhancement pipelines such as LIME and Retinex-Net established that separating images into reflectance and illumination is a principled and effective route for low-light and illumination-degraded restoration. These works directly motivate Reti-Diff\u2019s choice to predict compact reflectance and illumination priors tailored to correction and detail preservation. Second, advances in diffusion modeling for efficient and conditional restoration shape Reti-Diff\u2019s learning mechanism. Latent Diffusion Models demonstrate that shifting diffusion to a learned latent space yields large computational savings and better spatial consistency compared to pixel-space diffusion\u2014precisely addressing the heavy cost and misalignment issues highlighted by the authors. Palette and DDRM further show that diffusion can act as a versatile, powerful prior for image-to-image and inverse problems, suggesting a design where diffusion provides guidance rather than undertaking the full reconstruction. Finally, transformer-based restoration architectures such as Restormer provide effective context modeling and efficiency for high-resolution restoration, informing the RGformer\u2019s design to leverage Retinex priors for feature decomposition and reconstruction. Together, these works underpin Reti-Diff\u2019s key innovation: Retinex-grounded latent diffusion priors coupled with a Retinex-guided transformer to achieve illumination correction and detail recovery with improved efficiency and alignment.",
