  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014designing single-chain MCMC as finite state machines (FSMs) to eliminate synchronization overheads under vectorized execution\u2014sits at the intersection of accelerator-oriented systems and MCMC algorithms with inherently irregular control flow. On the systems side, JAX introduced composable program transformations such as vmap that make multi-chain MCMC attractive on accelerators; however, naive batching forces chains to proceed in lockstep, so the slowest chain dictates the iteration time. NumPyro widely operationalized this paradigm for HMC/NUTS, bringing the synchronization problem into practical focus.\nOn the algorithmic side, several influential samplers exhibit data-dependent, variable-length transitions\u2014precisely what triggers divergence under SIMD/vectorization. NUTS adapts trajectory lengths via tree building; Elliptical Slice Sampling iterates bracket expansions/angle updates until a slice condition is met; and Delayed Rejection performs multi-stage proposals. These methods directly motivate the FSM reparameterization showcased in the paper, where each chain advances through well-defined states stepwise without global barriers, enabling efficient vectorized execution.\nHistorically, accelerating MCMC with irregular control flow has been approached via speculative or asynchronous strategies. Parallel Predictive Prefetching demonstrates that speculative evaluation can improve utilization but at the cost of managing branching complexity; Asynchronous Gibbs shows that relaxing synchronization risks bias unless stringent conditions hold. The FSM formulation provides a principled alternative: it preserves exactness while aligning MCMC transitions with vectorized hardware execution, and the paper\u2019s speedup analysis formalizes when and why this restructuring yields substantial gains.",
