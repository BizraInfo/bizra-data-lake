  "synthesis_narrative": "This paper quantifies the value of having access to partial future reward information in reinforcement learning via competitive analysis, positioning its contribution at the intersection of online algorithms, prophet inequalities, and modern RL theory (offline and reward-free). The competitive-ratio lens originates in Borodin and El-Yaniv\u2019s framework, guiding the paper\u2019s worst-case, distribution-agnostic comparisons between standard and lookahead-enabled agents. Prophet inequality techniques, beginning with Samuel-Cahn\u2019s seminal 1/2 bound and extended by Kleinberg and Weinberg to structured settings, provide the methodological blueprint: relate an online policy to a clairvoyant benchmark, identify tight adversarial distributions, and derive exact ratios. In contrast to classical planning lookahead (as in Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis), which reasons about deeper search over transition dynamics, the present work isolates the informational advantage of reward previews, showing how exogenous reward foresight changes guarantees.\nCrucially, the derived ratios connect to quantities central to offline RL and reward-free exploration. The concentrability and coverage notions introduced by Munos and made explicit in the batch/offline setting by Chen and Jiang emerge naturally as the precise worst-case terms governing how much reward lookahead helps. Simultaneously, the paper\u2019s results align with the hardness and guarantees of reward-free exploration (Jin, Yang, Wang), revealing that the gain from reward lookahead can be interpreted through the same coverage-based bottlenecks that delimit offline and reward-agnostic learning. Together, these threads yield a tight, conceptually unified account of how and when partial reward foresight provides provable advantages in RL.",
