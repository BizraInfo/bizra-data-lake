  "synthesis_narrative": "TreeSynth\u2019s core innovation\u2014tree-guided subspace partitioning for synthetic data generation\u2014stands on two pillars: classical recursive space partitioning and modern LLM-based data synthesis/controllable generation. From the classical side, CART formalizes recursive splitting into mutually exclusive and exhaustive regions, while kd-trees show how to systematically divide high-dimensional spaces. TreeSynth adopts this paradigm to define a task\u2019s full data space at the root and to carve it into atomic, attribute-defined leaves, guaranteeing distinctiveness and coverage.\nOn the LLM side, Self-Instruct and WizardLM/Evol-Instruct demonstrate the feasibility of synthesizing instruction-following data from scratch and of boosting diversity through transformation. However, they largely rely on local sampling or evolutionary edits, which can propagate biases and leave gaps in coverage. TreeSynth generalizes beyond these by enforcing a global partition that explicitly enumerates attribute combinations and balances sampling across them. The approach aligns with controllable generation (e.g., PPLM) by conditioning on attributes, but it elevates control to a structural design: attributes form the axes of partition, not just prompts. Finally, while decoding-level methods like Diverse Beam Search improve variety within a prompt, TreeSynth addresses diversity at the dataset level by ensuring that sampling spans disjoint, comprehensive subspaces. Conceptually akin to Tree of Thoughts\u2019 tree-structured exploration, TreeSynth operationalizes tree guidance for dataset construction, combining principled partitioning with LLM synthesis to overcome repetition and bias at scale.",
