  "synthesis_narrative": "The core contribution of \u201cPlasticity as the Mirror of Empowerment\u201d is to formalize an agent\u2019s susceptibility to observations\u2014plasticity\u2014via a generalized directed information (GDI) that retains the operational strengths of directed information while extending it to the fully interactive, agent-centric setting. This builds directly on the empowerment program of Klyubin, Polani, and Nehaniv, which cast an agent\u2019s capacity to influence its future as mutual information/channel capacity from actions to future observations. To construct the mirror concept, the authors require a principled, causal, and time-aware measure of information flowing in the opposite direction\u2014from past observations to actions.\nMassey\u2019s directed information provides precisely the formal machinery for causal information flow with feedback. Kramer\u2019s development of causal conditioning, data-processing inequalities, and other structural properties supplies the desiderata that the new GDI must preserve to be a sound generalization. Tatikonda and Mitter\u2019s linkage between directed information and feedback channel capacity situates these quantities within sequential decision and control, aligning with the agent\u2013environment loop that empowerment originally leveraged. Schreiber\u2019s transfer entropy contributes an influential asymmetric notion of information transfer in time series, highlighting the importance of directionality and causality; GDI can be seen as encompassing such directional measures within a unified, agent-centric framework. Finally, Tishby and Polani\u2019s information-theoretic perspective on decisions and actions motivates treating both influence (empowerment) and susceptibility (plasticity) as two sides of the same perception\u2013action coin. Together, these works directly scaffold the paper\u2019s central idea: plasticity as the empowerment mirror, instantiated through a generalized directed information that strictly extends classical directed information while preserving its desirable properties.",
