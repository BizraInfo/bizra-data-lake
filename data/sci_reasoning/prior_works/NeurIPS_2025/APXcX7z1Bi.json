  "synthesis_narrative": "UniSite\u2019s core innovation\u2014recasting ligand binding site prediction as an end-to-end instance detection problem on a UniProt-centric, cross-structure dataset\u2014emerges from clear limitations in dominant pipelines and datasets. DeepSite introduced the deep learning formulation for pocket detection but entrenched grid-based binary segmentation followed by clustering, a discontinuous workflow subsequently exemplified and refined by Kalasanty\u2019s 3D U-Net segmentation and DeepPocket\u2019s fpocket-proposal plus CNN rescoring and per-candidate segmentation. These methods, along with the widely used P2Rank rank-then-cluster approach, also cemented evaluation conventions such as Top-n success and DCA measured per complex, which can mask failures on proteins with multiple distinct sites and enable structure-level leakage in training/testing. COACH and its COACH420 benchmark further standardized per-complex data organization and metrics, reinforcing these biases. At the same time, the community\u2019s reliance on fpocket for cavity proposals highlighted a fragility to handcrafted preprocessing. UniSite directly addresses these intertwined issues: inspired by the protein-centric organization of CrossDocked, it constructs UniSite-DS by aggregating all structures under each UniProt ID to expose multi-site reality and enforce protein-level splits. Methodologically, it abandons the segmentation-plus-clustering paradigm, learning pocket instances end-to-end without external proposal generators. Finally, it redefines evaluation to be protein-centric and multi-site aware, enabling fair, leakage-resistant comparisons and revealing gains specifically where earlier methods struggled\u2014proteins with multiple, diverse binding sites.",
