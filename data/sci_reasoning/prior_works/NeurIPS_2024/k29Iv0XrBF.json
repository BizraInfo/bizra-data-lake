  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014recovering a 3D object from a single image that is explicitly compatible with real-world physics\u2014emerges by fusing single-view inverse graphics with hard physical constraints. Differentiable rendering methods such as DVR and Soft Rasterizer established the analysis-by-synthesis foundation for optimizing 3D geometry from image evidence, but they typically ignore forces and material behaviors, producing shapes that look correct yet fail under gravity or loads. In parallel, the Tenenbaum group\u2019s Galileo and subsequent visual de-animation work framed vision as inference over latent physical properties, demonstrating that images reveal materials and forces when coupled with simulation; however, these efforts did not deliver full, physically robust 3D reconstructions. On the graphics and fabrication side, Make It Stand introduced optimizing shapes under a hard static equilibrium constraint to ensure stability\u2014an idea this paper imports directly, but now into the single-view reconstruction loop. Finally, differentiable physics frameworks like DiffTaichi showed that gradients through simulators enable joint optimization of geometry and material parameters, a practical necessity for the proposed decomposition into rest-shape, mechanical properties, and external forces. By integrating these threads, the paper advances single-view 3D modeling from \u201cvisually plausible\u201d to \u201cphysically compatible,\u201d using static equilibrium as a hard constraint to link disentangled physical attributes and guarantee stability and desired deformation behavior under real-world forces.",
