  "synthesis_narrative": "The core contribution\u2014adding an untrained register-like token and routing high-norm activations from a sparse set of \u201cregister neurons\u201d into it at inference time\u2014emerges by synthesizing insights across token-centric transformer design, special-token precedents, and recent analyses of outlier tokens. Darcet et al. (2024) provided the pivotal observation that ViTs develop high-norm outlier tokens that corrupt attention, and showed that learned register tokens mitigate the issue\u2014establishing both the problem and a retraining-heavy remedy. Building on the ViT tokenization paradigm of Dosovitskiy et al. (2020), and precedents like DeiT\u2019s distillation token (Touvron et al., 2021), the paper leverages the idea that introducing non-patch tokens can steer attention. Perceiver IO (Jaegle et al., 2021) further reinforced the value of content-agnostic latent tokens for information aggregation\u2014conceptually akin to \u201cregisters.\u201d Crucially, the practicality of intervening post hoc is supported by token-surgery methods like Token Merging (Bolya et al., 2023), which demonstrate that training-free token manipulation can improve behavior without retraining. Finally, widespread, pretrained ViT ecosystems such as CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) and DINOv2 (Oquab et al., 2023) exhibit the high-norm phenomenon and make retraining costly, directly motivating a training-free solution. The new method reframes Darcet et al.\u2019s trained-register idea as a mechanistic redirection of sparse neuron activations into an added, untrained token\u2014preserving the benefits of registers while avoiding retraining, and yielding cleaner attention and improved downstream features across existing models.",
