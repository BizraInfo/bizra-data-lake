  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation\u2014actively designing environments to rapidly and robustly identify a reward function from demonstrations\u2014sits at the intersection of classical IRL, Bayesian inference, and active/teaching paradigms. Ng and Russell (2000) established the IRL problem that this work addresses, while Ramachandran and Amir (2007) provided a Bayesian posterior-over-rewards that the paper\u2019s exact-inference variant directly builds on by selecting environments that maximize information gain about the reward. Ziebart et al. (2008) introduced the widely used maximum-entropy likelihood, serving as the paper\u2019s approximate-inference baseline that is upgraded with adaptive environment selection. A key motivation comes from Hadfield-Menell et al. (2017), who showed that rewards learned from a single training environment can be systematically misspecified and brittle under dynamics shifts; this paper targets that brittleness head-on by varying the environment to break reward\u2013dynamics confounds. Methodologically, the work draws on the active design ethos of Mindermann et al. (2019), extending active inverse reward design from preference queries over proxies to full expert demonstrations under selected dynamics. It also generalizes the active IRL idea of Cohn et al. (2011)\u2014from querying specific behaviors within a fixed MDP to choosing entire environments to elicit informative demonstrations. Finally, echoing the machine-teaching perspective of Cakmak and Lopes (2012), the paper treats environment selection as experiment design tailored to the learner\u2019s uncertainty, yielding gains in sample efficiency and robustness across both exact (Bayesian) and approximate (max-ent) IRL.",
