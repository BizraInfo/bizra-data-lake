  "synthesis_narrative": "Sliced Wasserstein distances were defined as expectations of one-dimensional Wasserstein distances over directions on the unit sphere, with practical approximation via Monte Carlo sampling of random projections, as established by Bonneel et al. Later, Kolouri et al. operationalized such SW-type objectives broadly, standardizing the use of finite random directions as the empirical SW estimator in applications. However, Deshpande et al. revealed that randomly chosen projections are often sample-inefficient, motivating deterministic selection of directions to reduce variance\u2014signaling that the projection set itself is a bottleneck. In parallel, Owen\u2019s randomized QMC theory showed that scrambling low-discrepancy sets yields unbiased estimators with markedly lower variance for smooth integrands, thereby reconciling variance reduction with the unbiasedness required in stochastic optimization. On the spherical domain specifically, Brauchart et al. developed QMC designs achieving optimal-order error for integration on S^2 and provided constructions based on discrepancy/energy principles. Complementing this, Keinert et al. introduced spherical Fibonacci (generalized spiral) point sets with excellent uniformity, while Rakhmanov et al. grounded energy-based optimization of spherical point sets through minimal Riesz-type energy formulations. Together, these works exposed MC sampling as a suboptimal approximation of the SW integral and supplied concrete QMC constructions on S^2 as well as randomized QMC machinery for unbiasedness. The current paper naturally synthesizes these strands by replacing MC directions with low-discrepancy spherical designs (including spiral and energy-optimized sets) for 3D SW and by deploying scrambling to create an unbiased randomized QSW estimator suitable for stochastic optimization, yielding lower absolute approximation error without changing the SW objective.",

    "abstract": "Monte Carlo (MC) integration has been employed as the standard approximation method for the Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance, whose analytical expression involves an intractable expectation. However, MC integration is not optimal in terms of absolute approximation error. To provide a better class of empirical SW, we propose quasi-sliced Wasserstein (QSW) approximations that rely on Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. For a comprehensive investigation of QMC for SW, we focus on the 3D setting, specifically computing the SW between probability measures in three dimensions. In greater detail, we empirically evaluate various methods to construct QMC point sets on the 3D unit-hypersphere, including the Gaussian-based and equal area mappings, generalized spiral points, and optimizing discrepancy energies. Furthermore, to obtain an unbiased estimator for stochastic optimization, we extend QSW to Randomized Quasi-Sliced Wasserstein (RQSW) by introducing randomness in the discussed point sets. The",
