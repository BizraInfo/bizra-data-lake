  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution is a token-level generalization bound for large language models that exploits martingale properties of sequential data, enabling nonvacuous bounds under far less restrictive compression than prior approaches. Two strands of prior work directly converge here. First, the compression-based generalization program\u2014exemplified by Arora et al.\u2014established that the description length of a compressed network can control generalization, and Dziugaite and Roy demonstrated that such bounds can be made nonvacuous for deep networks in practice. However, these approaches typically rely on IID samples and, when adapted to LLMs, have counted IID documents, leading to vacuity at billion-parameter scale unless compression is severe and degrades text quality. Second, learning theory for dependent data, including Mohri and Rostamizadeh\u2019s complexity bounds for non-IID processes and Freedman\u2019s martingale inequality, provides principled concentration for sequential, dependent observations. The present work fuses these strands: it replaces IID document counting with martingale-based token counting, greatly increasing effective sample size while retaining statistical validity for autoregressive training. This shift unlocks the use of richer, accuracy-preserving compression families\u2014such as Monarch structured matrices and Kronecker/tensor factorizations\u2014which offer compact parameterizations with strong empirical fidelity. By pairing token-level martingale concentration with expressive structured compressions, the paper produces tighter, practical generalization bounds at the scale of modern LLMs without resorting to overly aggressive, quality-harming compression.",
