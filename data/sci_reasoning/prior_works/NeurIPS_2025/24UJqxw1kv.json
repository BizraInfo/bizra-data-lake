  "synthesis_narrative": "FORL\u2019s core contribution\u2014robust offline RL under abrupt, time-varying, potentially non-Markovian offsets\u2014emerges from unifying advances in diffusion generative modeling, offline RL, and foundation models for time series. At the modeling level, DDPM provides the fundamental denoising diffusion framework, while TimeGrad demonstrates that diffusion/score-based approaches can yield calibrated probabilistic forecasts for time series, directly informing FORL\u2019s conditional diffusion module for candidate state generation. Diffuser further establishes that diffusion models can be embedded into decision-making pipelines; FORL adapts this idea from trajectory/action synthesis to state forecasting, proposing futures that account for latent, time-varying offsets.\n\nOn the RL side, IQL and CQL supply practical, conservative offline RL backbones that operate purely on static datasets, ensuring stability and safety against distributional extrapolation. FORL complements these by supplying forecasted, offset-adjusted candidate states to mitigate partial observability induced by non-stationarity, thereby improving decision quality without any additional environment interaction. Conceptually, PEARL motivates modeling hidden context to cope with task variation and partial observability; FORL achieves a zero-shot analogue by forecasting and integrating plausible future contexts/offsets at episode onset.\n\nFinally, the rise of time-series foundation models such as Chronos shows that large, pretrained forecasters can generalize zero-shot across domains. FORL leverages these models to obtain immediate offset forecasts, which, combined with diffusion-based candidate state generation, yields a unified, plug-and-play framework tailored to non-stationary offline settings.",
