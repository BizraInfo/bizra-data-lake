  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014formalizing and realizing flow equivariance for recurrent neural networks\u2014sits at the intersection of group-equivariant learning, Lie-theoretic constructions, and continuous-time sequence modeling. Cohen and Welling\u2019s Group Equivariant CNNs established that weight sharing via group actions yields layers as intertwiners, laying the conceptual foundation for imposing symmetry at the architectural level. Kondor and Trivedi then supplied a general representation-theoretic framework that characterizes all equivariant linear maps, which this work transposes from static actions to one-parameter Lie subgroups acting over time.\nSteerable CNNs and Tensor Field Networks advanced these ideas to continuous groups by organizing features into irreducible representations and enforcing equivariance via representation constraints. Crucially, Finzi et al. extended equivariant constructions to arbitrary Lie groups using Lie algebraic generators, directly enabling the paper\u2019s focus on flows as exponentials of infinitesimal actions and yielding practical constraints for recurrent updates.\nFinally, Neural ODEs and Neural CDEs reinterpreted RNNs as continuous-time dynamical systems, providing the mathematical vehicle to express hidden state evolution under time-parameterized transformations. By marrying Lie-algebraic equivariance (for flows) with continuous-time RNN formalisms, the paper shows standard RNNs break flow equivariance and proposes generator-consistent recurrent dynamics that preserve it, achieving a principled extension of equivariant theory to sequential data and temporal symmetries.",
