  "synthesis_narrative": "Classifier-free guidance established that a diffusion model\u2019s prediction can be decomposed into unconditional and text-conditioned components, and that their difference governs prompt adherence strength; the geometry of this conditional\u2013unconditional residual thus encodes how strongly text drives the denoising. Subsequent work on null-text inversion made this decomposition operational, showing that manipulating the null-text and guidance scale reliably controls reconstruction and semantic fidelity\u2014evidence that the conditional branch\u2019s magnitude is a sensitive dial for content specificity. In parallel, Prompt-to-Prompt introduced token-wise cross-attention control, evidencing that individual words can be isolated as steering factors in generation, while Attend-and-Excite used attention-based feedback to quantify and rebalance token salience via prompt edits. On the privacy side, Hayes et al. formalized membership inference for generative models and its evaluation lens, and Carlini et al. documented concrete regurgitation in diffusion models, revealing that certain prompts trigger near-duplicates of training images with legal and ethical risks.\nTogether these strands suggested a simple, model-internal signal\u2014the norm of the text-conditioned prediction\u2014as a one-shot detector for memorization: if the conditional residual dominates at early steps, the prompt likely elicits training-set-specific content. Token-level control and attention feedback naturally become attribution tools to localize which words drive that excess specificity, enabling interactive prompt adjustments. Finally, the null-text/guidance machinery points to practical mitigations: dynamically attenuating the conditional component or reweighting offending tokens when the signal spikes, thereby curbing regurgitation without altering the sampler or requiring multiple generations.",

    "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in diffusion models have exhibited exceptional image-generation capabilities. However, studies show that some outputs are merely replications of training data. Such replications present potential legal challenges for model owners, especially when the generated content contains proprietary information. In this work, we introduce a straightforward yet effective method for detecting memorized prompts by inspecting the magnitude of text-conditional predictions. Our proposed method seamlessly integrates without disrupting sampling algorithms, and delivers high accuracy even at the first generation step, with a single generation per prompt. Building on our detection strategy, we unveil an explainable approach that shows the contribution of individual words or tokens to memorization. This offers an interactive medium for users to adjust their prompts. Moreover, we propose two strategies i.e., to mitigate memorization by leveraging the magnitude of text-conditional predict",
