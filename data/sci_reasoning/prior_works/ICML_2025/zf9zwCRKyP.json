  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014showing and quantifying how voting-based LLM leaderboards like Chatbot Arena can be strategically manipulated\u2014stands squarely on the pairwise-comparison and rating literature that Arena operationalizes. Zheng et al. defined the exact evaluation protocol (pairwise, blind crowd votes aggregated via Arena Elo) that this paper simulates and attacks. The mathematical backbone of that protocol is the Bradley\u2013Terry paired-comparison model, which the authors leverage to compute how targeted wins translate into likelihood and parameter updates. Building further on Coulom\u2019s BayesElo/Whole-History Rating, they adopt the Bayesian update dynamics used in Arena to derive sensitivities and design an attack that schedules opponents and concentrates votes where they most move the posterior skill estimates.\n\nConceptually, the attack adapts the shilling/sybil-manipulation paradigm from recommender systems: Lam and Riedl\u2019s demonstration that fake users can steer ratings directly inspires the paper\u2019s vote-brigading approach in a pairwise setting. Mobasher et al.\u2019s taxonomy of attack models and robustness concerns sharpens the gap this paper addresses\u2014there has been no analogous, systematic treatment for Elo/BTL-based LLM leaderboards. Finally, the choice of which matchups to trigger to maximize rating movement borrows intuition from dueling-bandits active selection (Yue and Joachims), reframed adversarially to optimize rating shift rather than learning efficiency. The authors also discuss transfer and defenses across alternative Bayesian rating systems such as TrueSkill, linking their findings to the broader family of pairwise skill estimators.",
