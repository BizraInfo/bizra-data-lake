  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014controllable long-tailed recognition via hypernetwork-generated diverse experts that adapt to arbitrary test distributions\u2014sits at the intersection of three lines of work. First, HyperNetworks established that one network can generate the weights of another, while Pareto HyperNetworks showed how conditioning on a preference vector yields a continuum of models along a Pareto front. These ideas directly enable the paper\u2019s conditional weight generation: a single hypernetwork instantiates specialized experts tailored to user-specified head\u2013tail trade-offs. Second, the mixture/ensemble literature (Mixture of Experts and Deep Ensembles) motivates using multiple diverse models to improve robustness under shift. Rather than training many costly models, the paper uses a hypernetwork to efficiently produce a diverse expert set and then optimizes their ensemble to match the test distribution. Third, long-tailed recognition and label-shift calibration works (Decoupling Representation and Classifier, Logit Adjustment, and classical EM-based prior correction) formalize the key failure mode\u2014mismatch between train and test class priors\u2014and propose recalibration or decoupling strategies. The paper advances beyond per-model calibration by learning a distribution of experts spanning possible prior scenarios, enabling both automated adaptation to unknown test priors and explicit user control over head\u2013tail trade-offs. In sum, it fuses conditional hypernetworks (for controllable solution generation), expert ensembling (for robustness), and label-shift-aware long-tail theory (for principled adaptation) into a unified, controllable paradigm.",
