  "synthesis_narrative": "CBSA\u2019s core idea\u2014compressing many tokens into a few representatives and broadcasting back\u2014stands on a clear lineage of representative-based attention and optimization-derived architectures. Set Transformer laid the foundation with inducing-point attention (ISAB/PMA), showing that sets can be efficiently summarized by a small learned representative set and then disseminated back, a blueprint CBSA generalizes and grounds in optimization. Perceiver IO extended this bottleneck paradigm to broad modalities through a learnable latent array and bidirectional cross-attention; CBSA subsumes this case when representatives are fixed latents, but crucially provides a principled objective whose gradient step instantiates the forward pass. Slot Attention supplied the inspirational motif of clustering inputs into a few slots and then decoding, highlighting the interpretability benefits of object-like representatives; CBSA adopts this contract-and-broadcast behavior but replaces heuristic updates with a single, unrolled gradient step.\nOn the efficiency side, Nystr\u00f6mformer is the most direct baseline: its landmarks are a concrete instantiation of CBSA\u2019s representatives, yet CBSA unifies such choices under one objective while improving interpretability. Linformer typifies linear attention via low-rank projections but lacks semantic grounding; CBSA provides that missing optimization lens. Finally, the algorithm-unrolling paradigm of LISTA enables CBSA\u2019s architecture-as-optimization design, while Entmax epitomizes prior interpretability-only advances that preserved quadratic costs\u2014precisely the split CBSA bridges by jointly achieving interpretability and linear scaling.",
