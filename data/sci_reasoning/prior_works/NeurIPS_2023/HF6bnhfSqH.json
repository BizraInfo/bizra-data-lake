  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s central question\u2014can quantum models train with the same asymptotic efficiency as classical backpropagation?\u2014is anchored by Rumelhart\u2013Hinton\u2013Williams, which established that caching and reusing intermediate activations yields all gradients at roughly a single forward-pass cost. Quantum mechanics appears to forbid this reuse due to measurement collapse and the impossibility of duplicating unknown states. The no-cloning theorem (Wootters\u2013Zurek) and the Holevo bound jointly articulate the core obstruction: with single-copy access, one cannot both preserve and repeatedly extract enough information from intermediate quantum states to amortize gradients across many parameters.\n\nThe breakthrough lever enabling a quantum analogue of backprop-like scaling is shadow tomography. Aaronson\u2019s shadow tomography introduced the idea that, given multiple fresh copies, one can compress measurement data into a representation that supports estimating many observables later. Huang\u2013Kueng\u2013Preskill\u2019s classical shadows operationalized this with near-optimal sample complexity, making multi-observable estimation practical and theoretically tight. Building on these foundations, the paper shows that if multiple copies of intermediate states are available, shadow-based techniques can \u201ccheat\u201d measurement collapse: reuse randomized measurement records to recover all needed gradients, matching backpropagation\u2019s scaling.\n\nThis result is cast against the prevailing variational quantum learning paradigm (Mitarai et al.) and its standard gradient estimator, the parameter-shift rule (Schuld et al.), whose cost scales with the number of parameters. The paper thus synthesizes classical backprop\u2019s information-reuse principle, quantum information limits (no-cloning/Holevo), and multi-copy shadow tomography to delineate a tight boundary: backprop-like efficiency is impossible with single-copy access, but achievable with multiple copies via shadow-based gradient estimation.",
