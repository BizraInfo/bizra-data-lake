  "synthesis_narrative": "MoESD\u2019s core contribution\u2014explaining and exploiting why sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models can benefit disproportionately from speculative decoding (SD) under realistic batch sizes\u2014sits at the intersection of two lines of work. On the MoE side, GShard established the modern expert-routing paradigm and its distributed systems footprint, while Switch Transformers simplified gating and highlighted how conditional sparsity changes per-token compute. GLaM then demonstrated that sparse MoE can achieve strong quality\u2013efficiency tradeoffs in large language models, clarifying the inference-time compute composition (expert MLPs, gating, and communication) that MoESD analyzes. DeepSpeed-MoE contributed practical insights into expert parallelism and communication overheads, which directly inform MoESD\u2019s batch-size\u2013aware modeling of end-to-end latency.\nOn the SD side, the foundational draft-and-verify method formalized by Leviathan et al. provides the acceptance-driven baseline that most subsequent work optimizes. Medusa extended this by raising acceptance rates via multiple draft heads within a single model. MoESD departs from the prevailing acceptance-only lens: by integrating MoE-specific sparsity, routing, and communication into a quantitative model, it predicts when SD\u2019s verification cost is amortized more effectively in MoE than in dense models and shows that increased sparsity widens the effective batch-size window. Together, these prior works supply the algorithmic primitives (SD), architectural foundations (sparse MoE), and systems realities (expert parallelism and communication) that MoESD unifies into a theory-backed explanation and demonstration of SD\u2019s unique acceleration potential for sparse MoEs.",
