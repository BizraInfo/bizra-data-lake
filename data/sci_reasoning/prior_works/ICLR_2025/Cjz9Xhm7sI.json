  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation fuses a spatiotemporally coherent Gaussian representation with an efficient sequence model to predict 3D radar volumes over time. Its representational backbone is a direct extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting (Kerbl et al., 2023), adopting anisotropic Gaussians and differentiable splatting but retooling them to maintain consistent Gaussian identities across frames. This temporal consistency is inspired by Dynamic 3D Gaussians (Luiten et al., 2023), which demonstrated that persistent Gaussian identity and tracked motion enable coherent dynamics; the present work adapts this idea to radar volumes. In contrast to 4D Gaussian Splatting (Wu et al., 2024), which parameterizes time inside each Gaussian, the authors explicitly target that approach\u2019s training and storage overhead by optimizing per-frame 3D Gaussians and tracking them, thereby addressing a clear gap for scalable dynamic representation. On the forecasting side, the problem formulation traces to precipitation nowcasting with ConvLSTM (Shi et al., 2015), while strong 2D sequence baselines like PredRNN (Wang et al., 2017) and MetNet (S\u00f8nderby et al., 2020) contextualize the field\u2019s prevailing limitation to 2D slices. The proposed GauMamba extends Mamba (Gu et al., 2024) to operate over sequences of tracked Gaussian states and motions, leveraging selective state-space modeling for efficient long-range dependencies. Together, these works directly shape the paper\u2019s key idea: trackable, per-frame 3D Gaussian radar representations forecasted with a linear-time state-space model to achieve efficient, accurate 3D nowcasting.",
