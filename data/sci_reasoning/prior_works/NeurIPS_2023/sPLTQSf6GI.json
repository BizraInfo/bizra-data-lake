  "synthesis_narrative": "Park, Buchholz, Sch\u00f6lkopf, and Muandet position causality as an extension of Kolmogorov\u2019s measure-theoretic probability, proposing a causal space that augments a probability space with causal (transition) kernels encoding interventional structure. Kolmogorov\u2019s 1933 axioms supply the foundational blueprint: a rigorous probability space becomes the substrate to which causal structure is added. Kallenberg\u2019s modern probability consolidates the needed machinery\u2014Markov/transition kernels, regular conditional probabilities, and stochastic processes\u2014making kernels the natural vehicle for compositional causal specification. \nPearl\u2019s SCMs and do-calculus provide the interventional semantics to be generalized: rather than deterministic structural equations, interventions become principled kernel modifications within the same probability space. Dawid\u2019s regime-based, measure-theoretic view of interventions further justifies modeling interventions as changes in stochastic kernels, aligning causality with standard probability without counterfactual primitives. \nFritz\u2019s axiomatization of probability via Markov kernels shows that kernels can serve as the primitive arrows of probabilistic reasoning; the present work leverages this perspective to make causal kernels the primitive carriers of causal information. Addressing known limitations of classical frameworks, Bongers\u2013Forr\u00e9\u2013Peters\u2013Mooij\u2019s generalized SCMs with cycles and latent variables motivate a framework that natively supports feedback and hidden confounding, which the authors achieve by not restricting to acyclic graphical semantics. Finally, Richardson and Robins\u2019 SWIGs highlight the need to unify counterfactual and graphical views under explicit interventions, a goal met here by embedding intervention semantics directly into a measure-theoretic causal space. Together these works converge to a kernel-based axiomatization that unifies interventions, cycles, latents, and stochastic processes.",
