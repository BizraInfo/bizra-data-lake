  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of Li and Li is to bring the error-feedback (EF) principle\u2014long known to debias compressed gradients\u2014into the federated learning (FL) setting and to analyze it rigorously for non-convex objectives under partial participation. The FL template and the full-precision benchmark are set by FedAvg (McMahan et al.), whose local-update/periodic-averaging paradigm and random client sampling define the problem the authors aim to match in accuracy while reducing communication. The EF mechanism itself originates from sparsified SGD with memory (Stich et al.), which established how residual accumulation corrects the bias of compressors like Top-k. Karimireddy et al. then provided a unifying theory showing that EF fixes biased schemes, including SignSGD, and clarified why naive biased compression can fail\u2014an insight the present paper transfers to federated optimization with heterogeneous data and client sampling.\n\nRecent EF refinements, such as EF21 (Gorbunov et al.), offered simpler analyses and improved rates in centralized/distributed settings; Li and Li extend this line by proving that EF in FL can match full-precision FedAvg rates and achieve linear speedup with respect to the number of clients. On the FL-compression side, FedPAQ (Reisizadeh et al.) analyzed client-sampled FL with quantization but focused on unbiased compression, leaving a gap for biased compressors. By addressing this gap, and by showing why directly applying biased compression in FL converges poorly while EF restores fast convergence, the paper forges a direct bridge between EF theory and practical, communication-efficient federated training.",
