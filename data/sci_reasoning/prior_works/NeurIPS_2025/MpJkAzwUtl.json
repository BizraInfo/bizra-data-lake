  "synthesis_narrative": "ProDVa\u2019s core innovation\u2014dynamically retrieving natural protein fragments based on functional descriptions and integrating them into a protein language model\u2014arises from the convergence of two intellectual lineages. First, classical Rosetta-era fragment assembly (Simons et al., 1997) and its validation in successful de novo designs (Kuhlman et al., 2003) established that short, reusable fragments from natural proteins provide powerful structural priors that promote foldability. This fragment-centric view directly motivates ProDVa\u2019s \u2018dynamic protein vocabulary,\u2019 explicitly importing natural fragments to constrain generative search toward realistic folds. Second, the rise of protein language models (Rives et al., 2021) and function-conditioned generation (ProGen; Madani et al., 2020; 2023) defined the modern, text/function-to-sequence design paradigm. However, these models revealed a key shortcoming: while sequences could exhibit desired functions, structural plausibility and foldability remained insufficiently controlled\u2014precisely the gap ProDVa targets. Bridging these strands, retrieval-augmented generation from NLP (Lewis et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022) provided the operational blueprint: condition a generator on relevant retrieved context. ProDVa repurposes this idea by retrieving protein fragments (rather than text) keyed by functional descriptions, then conditioning a protein LM on those fragments during generation. The result is a function-conditioned design system that retains the flexibility and semantic control of protein LMs while importing the structural reliability of fragment-based design, directly addressing the foldability limitations identified in prior function-driven generative approaches.",
