  "synthesis_narrative": "A series of works laid the groundwork for evaluating causal discovery on time series and highlighted critical gaps. CauseMe introduced the first dedicated platform for benchmarking time-series causal inference with realistic noise, confounding, and lag structures, seeding community standards for protocols and metrics. PCMCI+ provided a scalable conditional-independence framework tailored to autocorrelated, high-dimensional time series, clarifying how to control false positives under strong temporal dependence. DYNOTEARS framed dynamic DAG learning directly from time-indexed observations with explicit lags, but under linear-Gaussian and stationarity assumptions. TCDF contributed a nonlinear, attention-like lag-selection mechanism for multivariate series, emphasizing interpretability of temporal effects. tsFCI adapted FCI to time series with latent variables, formalizing evaluation on partially oriented graphs in the presence of hidden confounders. Convergent Cross Mapping offered a nonlinear pairwise causality tool popular in geosciences, yet known to be sensitive to shared drivers and time delays. The T\u00fcbingen cause-effect benchmark established real-world evaluation culture but remained pairwise and non-temporal. Taken together, these works underscored the need for a large-scale, multivariate, in-the-wild time-series benchmark with domain-grounded ground truth and natural interventions. The current paper synthesizes CauseMe\u2019s benchmarking ethos, PCMCI+/DYNOTEARS/TCDF/tsFCI\u2019s methodological targets, and CCM\u2019s geoscience relevance, and advances the field by delivering a dense hydrological network with known flow topology and high-frequency dynamics to rigorously test method assumptions about nonlinearity, evolving structure, lags, and hidden confounding.",

    "abstract": "Causal discovery, or identifying causal relationships from observational data, is a notoriously challenging task, with numerous methods proposed to tackle it.\nDespite this, in-the-wild evaluation of these methods is still lacking, as works frequently rely on synthetic data evaluation and sparse real-world examples under critical theoretical assumptions.\nReal-world causal structures, however, are often complex, evolving over time, non-linear, and influenced by unobserved factors, making\nit hard to decide on a proper causal discovery strategy.\nTo bridge this gap, we introduce CausalRivers, the largest in-the-wild causal discovery benchmarking kit for time-series data to date.\nCausalRivers features an extensive dataset on river discharge that covers the eastern German territory (666 measurement stations) and the state of Bavaria (494  measurement stations).\nIt spans the years 2019 to 2023 with a 15-minute temporal resolution.\nFurther, we provide additional data from a flood around the Elb",
