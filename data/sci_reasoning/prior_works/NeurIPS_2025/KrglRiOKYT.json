  "synthesis_narrative": "AMRC is grounded in the Information Bottleneck principle, which provides the conceptual basis for discarding redundant temporal content while preserving predictive signal. This theoretical lens motivates the paper\u2019s central claim: longer histories do not necessarily yield better forecasts when models absorb noise and irrelevant fluctuations. The method\u2019s adaptive masking loss draws on two direct methodological streams. First, selective subsequence ideas\u2014from rationales in NLP and time-series shapelets\u2014show that only a compact subset of tokens/segments can be sufficient for strong prediction. AMRC operationalizes this by learning to abstain from uninformative regions and to retain core, discriminative temporal segments, guiding gradient descent toward signal-rich windows. Second, focal loss offers a loss-design precedent for emphasizing informative parts of the training signal; AMRC extends this notion to the temporal axis, effectively reweighting learning at the segment level. To make segment selection trainable, AMRC can leverage differentiable relaxations such as the Concrete distribution, enabling end-to-end learning of binary-like masks. Complementing the masking loss, AMRC\u2019s representation consistency term inherits from consistency-regularization methods like Mean Teacher, enforcing alignment between representations derived from masked and full views to prevent representation drift and preserve task-relevant invariants. Finally, AMRC\u2019s empirical stance directly engages and challenges the long-sequence information gain hypothesis embodied by state-of-the-art long-term forecasters such as Autoformer, showing that targeted truncation with adaptive masking and consistency can improve signal extraction and forecasting accuracy.",
