  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s central idea\u2014thought communication\u2014sits at the intersection of multi-agent communication and identifiable multi-view latent variable modeling. Early deep multi-agent works such as Foerster et al. and CommNet established that agents can coordinate effectively by exchanging continuous hidden states, not just language. This empirical precedence directly motivates a formal, language-free channel where messages are interpreted as latent \u2018thoughts.\u2019 To make such thoughts principled and recoverable, the paper turns to multi-view statistics: JIVE provides a template for decomposing multiple views into joint (shared) and individual (private) components, aligning precisely with the paper\u2019s shared/private thought split across agents.\n\nAchieving rigorous guarantees requires identifiability tools. Nonlinear ICA (Hyv\u00e4rinen & Morioka) and tensor-based multi-view methods (Anandkumar et al.) show how auxiliary structure or multi-view moments can render latent factors identifiable despite nonlinear mixing. The paper advances this thread by proving identifiability in a nonparametric setting without auxiliary variables, leveraging the multi-agent (multi-view) design and the shared/private structure. Foundational identifiability results in latent class models (Allman et al.) reinforce the core principle that sufficient views enable recovery of latent structure, which the paper generalizes to continuous, unknown generating mechanisms. Finally, inferring the global organization of which agents share which thoughts parallels latent graphical model selection (Chandrasekaran et al.), where observed dependencies are decomposed to reveal latent-induced structure. Collectively, these strands converge to support the paper\u2019s key contribution: a theoretically grounded, non-linguistic communication paradigm with provable recovery of shared and private latent thoughts and the global thought-sharing topology.",
