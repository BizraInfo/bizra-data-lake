  "synthesis_narrative": "Local-update training emerged as a practical way to reduce communication in distributed learning through FedAvg, which established periodic averaging after multiple local steps on each worker. Theoretical and empirical work on Local SGD then refined this paradigm, showing fast convergence with significantly fewer communications by interleaving local updates and sparse synchronizations. To keep local models from drifting too far, Elastic Averaging SGD introduced an explicit penalty that elastically tethers worker parameters toward a center, providing a concrete mechanism to control divergence under local computation. In parallel, the Stale Synchronous Parallel model formalized bounded staleness, quantifying and constraining the step gap among workers to preserve convergence while relaxing strict synchronization. At the systems level, Hogwild demonstrated that non-blocking, wait-free updates can yield efficient parallelism by avoiding coordination stalls, even with asynchronous interactions. Finally, MIME highlighted that naive local-update schemes can become unstable due to momentum accumulation and proposed momentum-aware corrections to mitigate drift.\nBringing these threads together revealed a clear opportunity: combine local updates with truly asynchronous, wait-free communication to hide network costs entirely, while explicitly regulating divergence and momentum dynamics. CO2 seizes this by enabling full communication\u2013computation overlap via asynchronous exchanges layered atop local SGD, borrowing bounded-staleness ideas to introduce a staleness gap penalty for stability and applying outer momentum clipping to tame momentum under asynchrony. This synthesis naturally extends prior insights into a bandwidth-resilient, scalable training recipe for multi-node clusters.",

    "abstract": "The fundamental success of large language models hinges upon the efficacious implementation of large-scale distributed training techniques. Nevertheless, building a vast, high-performance cluster featuring high-speed communication interconnectivity is prohibitively costly, and accessible only to prominent entities. In this work, we aim to lower this barrier and democratize large-scale training with limited bandwidth clusters. We propose a new approach called CO2 that introduces local-updating and asynchronous communication to the distributed data-parallel training, thereby facilitating the full overlap of COmmunication with COmputation. CO2 is able to attain a high scalability even on extensive multi-node clusters constrained by very limited communication bandwidth. We further propose the staleness gap penalty and outer momentum clipping techniques together with CO2 to bolster its convergence and training stability. Besides, CO2 exhibits seamless integration with well-established ZeRO-",
