  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of this work is Unbalanced Flow Matching (UFM): a principled generalization of flow matching that introduces mass-change terms and composition of flows to more faithfully transport between complex, mismatched distributions\u2014here, ligand\u2013protein poses with flexible receptors and realistic energetics. The methodological backbone comes from flow-based generative modeling: Flow Matching provides the velocity-field objective that UFM extends, while Stochastic Interpolants supplies the conditional flow-matching and interpolation viewpoint unifying flows and diffusions and making transport learning tractable. To go beyond mass-preserving mappings, UFM draws directly on unbalanced optimal transport. Chizat et al. formalize dynamic unbalanced OT via continuity equations with source terms, which UFM instantiates to allow growth/decay of probability mass and thereby handle support mismatch inherent in flexible docking and relaxation. Liero\u2013Mielke\u2013Savar\u00e9\u2019s Hellinger\u2013Kantorovich metric provides the variational and geometric foundation to regularize and trade off mass variation against transport accuracy, operationalizing UFM\u2019s sample-efficiency versus fidelity control. On the application side, DiffDock is the immediate baseline and the paper\u2019s explicit gap: diffusion-based rigid docking can produce nonphysical poses and cannot model receptor flexibility. UFM-powered FlexDock directly targets these shortcomings by learning accurate, composable transports and adding relaxation. Earlier geometric docking such as EquiBind serves as another baseline surpassed by a transport-path perspective. Finally, Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge work crystallized the \u201cbridge two distributions\u201d paradigm that UFM adopts but replaces with a deterministic, unbalanced flow formulation better aligned with flexible docking and structure relaxation.",
