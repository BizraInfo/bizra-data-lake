  "synthesis_narrative": "This paper\u2019s core insight\u2014that standard neural networks can achieve compositional generalization when both data and model are scaled with sufficient coverage\u2014sits at the intersection of empirical observations about scaling and formal results on compositional function approximation. The challenge was crystallized by Lake and Baroni, whose SCAN results highlighted systematic failures of seq2seq models on novel compositions. Keysers et al.\u2019s CFQ then reframed the issue as one of distributional coverage: models falter when test compositions are underrepresented, implying that the breadth of training compositions is pivotal. Csord\u00e1s et al. further weakened the case for specialized architectures by showing substantial gains in systematic generalization from capacity increases and training refinements using standard Transformers. On the theoretical front, Poggio and collaborators established that deep networks efficiently approximate hierarchical compositional functions\u2014precisely the structural prior needed to justify linear scaling in the number of modules\u2014while Yarotsky provided tight ReLU approximation bounds that facilitate proofs of approximation to arbitrary precision. The scaling perspective is cemented by Wei et al., who cataloged emergent abilities\u2014including compositional-like behaviors\u2014that arise at scale, and by Hoffmann et al., who formalized how data\u2013parameter balance governs performance, aligning with the paper\u2019s emphasis on sufficient task-space coverage. Together, these works directly motivate and substantiate the paper\u2019s dual claim: empirically, compositional generalization emerges from scale and coverage; theoretically, standard MLPs possess the capacity to represent compositional task families with favorable, near-linear parameter growth.",
