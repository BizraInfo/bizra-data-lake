  "synthesis_narrative": "BackTime\u2019s core contribution\u2014an effective backdoor attack on multivariate time-series forecasting via vulnerable-timestamp selection and an adaptively learned, stealthy trigger\u2014builds on three converging lines of prior work. First, foundational backdoor papers such as BadNets and Trojaning Attack establish the trigger-based poisoning paradigm and optimization-driven design of attacks, which BackTime repurposes from vision to forecasting. Second, recent advances in stealthy and dynamic triggers (Hidden Trigger Backdoor Attacks; WaNet) show that triggers must be imperceptible and distribution-consistent to evade detection, directly shaping BackTime\u2019s objective to synthesize subtle, time-series-conforming patterns rather than obvious implants. Third, bilevel optimization methods for poisoning, exemplified by Witches\u2019 Brew, provide a scalable mechanism to couple poison crafting with downstream training dynamics; BackTime adapts this bilevel perspective to the sequential domain, using it both to choose when to poison (vulnerable timestamps) and to learn attack-specific triggers.\nCrucially, BackTime tailors trigger generation to multivariate dependencies by leveraging graph-based modeling ideas from GNN-driven forecasting (e.g., DCRNN), but uses a GNN as a generator to encode inter-variable structure in the trigger itself. Finally, the selection of poisoning locations echoes influence-function thinking: by operationalizing which timestamps most affect forecasts, BackTime maximizes attack leverage with minimal perturbations. Together, these strands\u2014trigger backdoors, stealth/dynamic design, bilevel poisoning optimization, graph-aware multivariate modeling, and influence-guided selection\u2014coalesce into a targeted, stealthy backdoor specifically engineered for MTS forecasting.",
