  "synthesis_narrative": "Fourmer\u2019s core idea\u2014an efficient, globally aware restoration backbone that adheres to a spatial interaction plus channel evolution paradigm while operating in the Fourier domain\u2014emerges from two converging lines of work. On the restoration side, IPT introduced a unified Transformer formulation across tasks, but at substantial memory cost, while SwinIR and Restormer made global modeling practical for high-resolution restoration via windowed or tailored attention and specialized feed-forward designs. These systems crystallized the two-branch block design (spatial interaction + channel evolution) yet still faced either heavy memory or limited global context, exposing the need for a more efficient, fully global mechanism. Concurrently, frequency-domain architectures showed that Fourier transforms can provide inexpensive global mixing. FNet proved FFT-based token mixing can replace attention, and GFNet extended frequency-domain global filtering to vision with strong efficiency. Complementing these, FcaNet demonstrated that frequency statistics are powerful signals for channel weighting. Finally, MAXIM reinforced the generality of the spatial/channel separation for image processing. Fourmer synthesizes these precedents: it keeps the proven restoration block blueprint from Restormer/SwinIR/MAXIM, swaps attention/MLP token mixing for Fourier spatial interaction inspired by FNet/GFNet to achieve innate globality with low memory, and replaces conventional channel MLPs with Fourier-based channel evolution adapted from FcaNet to encode degradation priors. This direct lineage yields a frequency-driven, degradation-aware global modeling paradigm.",
