  "synthesis_narrative": "Social Chemistry 101 showed that everyday situations can be represented by compact social and moral rules-of-thumb, making normative reasoning over daily life a tractable modeling target. Delphi then demonstrated that language models can render such judgments but often do so opaquely and inconsistently, revealing the need for structured probes that expose the value trade-offs behind model outputs. SCRUPLES surfaced ambiguity and community disagreement in ethical judgments, underscoring that many real decisions are contested rather than clear-cut and thus require formulations that capture competing, legitimate values. The Moral Machine experiment pioneered large-scale pairwise moral dilemmas with cross-cultural analysis, validating pairwise choice as a vehicle to elicit preferences, albeit within stylized trolley scenarios. In parallel, the World Values Survey articulated sociological value dimensions suitable for aggregating preferences across topics and populations, while Moral Foundations Theory provided psychologically grounded moral dimensions for coding what values a choice implicates. Constitutional AI reframed alignment as adherence to an explicit set of principles, highlighting a gap between declared constitutions and the values models actually enact under pressure. Together, these works reveal a missing diagnostic: everyday, two-sided dilemmas with explicit affected parties and value tags that allow principled aggregation across established value taxonomies. DailyDilemmas synthesizes these insights by pairing quotidian choices, annotating their implicated values, and analyzing model selections through WVS and MFT lenses (among others), thereby turning opaque moral judgments into measurable value preferences and exposing how aligned models prioritize values in practice.",

    "abstract": "As users increasingly seek guidance from LLMs for decision-making in daily life, many of these decisions are not clear-cut and depend significantly on the personal values and ethical standards of people. We present DailyDilemmas, a dataset of 1,360 moral dilemmas encountered in everyday life. Each dilemma presents two possible actions, along with affected parties and relevant human values for each action. Based on these dilemmas, we gather a repository of human values covering diverse everyday topics, such as interpersonal relationships, workplace, and environmental issues. With DailyDilemmas, we evaluate LLMs on these dilemmas to determine what action they will choose and the values represented by these action choices. Then, we analyze values through the lens of five theoretical frameworks inspired by sociology, psychology, and philosophy, including the World Values Survey, Moral Foundations Theory, Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, Aristotle's Virtues, and Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions.
