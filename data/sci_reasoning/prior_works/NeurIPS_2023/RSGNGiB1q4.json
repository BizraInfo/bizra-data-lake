  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core move is to reinterpret leading KGE score functions as tractable probabilistic circuits, then enforce simple constraints (non-negativity or squaring) to convert them into normalized generative models that permit exact maximum-likelihood learning, efficient sampling, and built-in logical constraints. This synthesis stands on two pillars. First, multilinear/tensor KGE formulations\u2014RESCAL, ComplEx, TuckER, and CP/N3\u2014provide the precise algebraic score forms to be recast as circuit computations. These models\u2019 bilinear or Tucker/CP factorization structures map naturally onto circuit graphs where sums and products reflect mixture and factorization over entities and relations. Second, the tractable inference literature on circuits\u2014arithmetic circuits and sum-product networks\u2014supplies the key structural conditions (decomposability, smoothness) and parameter constraints (notably non-negativity) that guarantee exact marginalization and normalized densities, enabling exact MLE and sampling. The PSDD line further demonstrates how logical constraints can be embedded into the circuit\u2019s support while retaining tractability, which the authors exploit to ensure constraint satisfaction by design. By marrying the expressiveness and empirical strength of standard KGEs with the provable tractability of probabilistic circuits, the paper provides a principled path from discriminative KGE scoring to fully generative, scalable models for knowledge graphs without sacrificing link prediction performance.",
