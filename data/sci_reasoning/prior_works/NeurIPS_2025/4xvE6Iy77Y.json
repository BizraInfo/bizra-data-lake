  "synthesis_narrative": "PRIMT\u2019s core innovation fuses preference-based reward learning with foundation-model-driven multimodal evaluation and synthetic trajectories. The starting point is Christiano et al. (2017), which established learning reward models from pairwise preferences\u2014a paradigm PRIMT retains but seeks to de-bottleneck by curbing human effort and improving credit assignment. Sadigh et al. (2017) diagnosed two central obstacles\u2014label inefficiency and ambiguous queries\u2014traditionally addressed via active querying. PRIMT tackles the same issues from a new angle: it generates clearer, richer feedback by combining LLM reasoning with VLM grounding, thereby mitigating ambiguity without exhaustive human interaction.\nT-REX (Brown et al., 2019) showed that ranking trajectories can improve temporal credit assignment even with suboptimal data. PRIMT leverages this insight but replaces noisy, scarce human rankings with structured multimodal judgments, strengthening the reliability of reward learning. To reduce dependence on humans further, PRIMT adopts the AI-feedback principle from Constitutional AI (Bai et al., 2022) and the LLM-as-a-Judge line (Zheng et al., 2023), while addressing their single-modality fragility through a hierarchical neuro-symbolic fusion of VLMs and LLMs tailored to embodied behavior evaluation. Finally, PRIMT\u2019s foresight trajectory generation for warm-starting draws on model-based rollouts exemplified by MBPO (Janner et al., 2019), substituting classical learned dynamics with powerful foundation models to synthesize plausible trajectories early in training. Together, these threads produce a system that reduces human load, resolves ambiguity, and improves credit assignment through multimodal, FM-augmented preference learning and trajectory synthesis.",
