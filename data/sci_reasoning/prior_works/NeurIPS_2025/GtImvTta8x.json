  "synthesis_narrative": "SIU3R\u2019s core insight\u2014performing native 3D scene understanding and reconstruction without 2D-to-3D feature alignment\u2014emerges from merging three influential threads of research. First, pixel-aligned 3D representations from PIFu and their image-conditioned extensions in pixelNeRF showed that 3D can be queried through per-pixel features, enabling generalizable reconstruction. SIU3R leverages this pixel-aligned principle but elevates it from object- or view-conditioned inference to a shared 3D feature space that jointly supports reconstruction and multi-task understanding.\nSecond, the query-based transformer paradigm inaugurated by DETR and generalized by Mask2Former provides a unifying interface for heterogeneous perception tasks. SIU3R adapts this idea to 3D: a set of learnable queries operates directly on the pixel-aligned 3D representation, enabling semantic and instance-level reasoning without projecting 2D features into 3D or distilling from 2D models.\nThird, tackling unposed inputs builds upon pose-robust neural reconstruction (e.g., BARF), allowing SIU3R to work from unposed image collections. In parallel, the community\u2019s reliance on high-fidelity 3D representations like 3D Gaussian Splatting, and semantic alignment approaches such as LERF, exposed limitations of 2D-to-3D feature lifting\u2014semantic loss and constrained 3D reasoning\u2014that SIU3R addresses by learning semantics natively in 3D. Combining these strands, SIU3R formalizes a shared, pixel-aligned 3D feature field and unified 3D queries, and adds lightweight interaction modules so that reconstruction and understanding mutually reinforce each other\u2014achieving alignment-free, generalizable 3D scene intelligence.",
