  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014practical, certifiable lower bounds for pipeline-parallel DNN inference via novel MIP relaxations\u2014sits squarely on the trajectory defined by pipeline parallelism and automatic partitioning. GPipe established the throughput model for micro-batched pipelines and framed the central objective: minimize the bottleneck stage time, including activation transfers. PipeDream operationalized this paradigm at scale with scheduling and partitioning heuristics, but without guarantees of optimality. Widely adopted systems like Megatron-LM continued this line with simple, communication-aware layer splits that work well empirically yet provide no measure of solution quality.\n\nConcurrently, automatic parallelization frameworks such as FlexFlow and Alpa advanced search-based and cost-model-driven planning across data, tensor, and pipeline parallelism. However, these planners, while effective, lack optimality certificates or strong lower bounds to inform practitioners when a found partition is \u2018good enough.\u2019 In practice, the only broadly applicable guarantees came from classical work/span-style combinatorial bounds originating in Brent\u2019s theorem, which are too loose to guide real deployments.\n\nThis paper closes that gap by designing MIP relaxations tailored to the pipeline partitioning objective used by GPipe/PipeDream/Megatron-style systems, explicitly accounting for communication. The resulting lower bounds are both strong and practical, enabling performance guarantees across hundreds of production models and directly addressing the long-standing lack of certification in prior heuristic and search-based approaches.",
