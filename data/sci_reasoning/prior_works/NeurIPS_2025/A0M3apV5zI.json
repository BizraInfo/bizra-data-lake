  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014precise asymptotics for UCB-V\u2019s arm-pulling rates, the discovery of potential instability (non-deterministic limiting fractions), and refined high-probability regret\u2014rests on three intertwined lines of prior work. First, classical asymptotic theory by Lai and Robbins and its KL-index refinement by Burnetas and Katehakis established the benchmark of deterministic target sampling proportions and asymptotically optimal allocation, which frame what \u201cstable\u201d long-run behavior should look like. Second, the algorithmic lineage from Auer, Cesa-Bianchi, and Fischer\u2019s UCB to Audibert, Munos, and Szepesv\u00e1ri\u2019s UCB-V provides both the canonical baseline and the specific variance-aware index under study; the latter\u2019s empirical-variance radii naturally call for empirical-Bernstein concentration, as formalized by Maurer and Pontil, to secure tight, time-uniform high-probability controls. Third, recent precise analyses of canonical UCB by Kalvit and Zeevi and by Khamaru and Zhang developed pathwise, instance-dependent characterizations of pull counts and refined non-asymptotic bounds. This paper extends that methodological toolkit to the variance-aware regime, showing that the additional stochasticity introduced by variance estimation can disrupt the deterministic sampling proportions seen in canonical UCB, leading to instability. Leveraging empirical-Bernstein-style control, the authors also derive high-probability bounds on pull counts that translate into refined, instance-dependent regret bounds for UCB-V\u2014results that were previously unavailable even for this classic variance-aware algorithm.",
