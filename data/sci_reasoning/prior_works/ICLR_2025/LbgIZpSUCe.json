  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014nonlinear within-region dynamics linked by parametric impulse-response communication channels\u2014emerges from three converging lines of prior work. First, latent dynamical systems for neural populations (Gao et al., fLDS) and variational sequence models with nonlinear generators (Pandarinath et al., LFADS) established that single-area neural computations can be recovered by fitting latent dynamical models to population activity. The present work extends this paradigm to a multi-region setting and replaces unstructured exogenous inputs with structured, interpretable inter-areal drive. Second, neuron-level point-process models (Truccolo et al.) and population GLMs with coupling filters (Pillow et al.) pioneered the use of parametric impulse responses to represent directed influence; this paper elevates that mechanism to the mesoscale by parameterizing region-to-region channels via impulse responses that naturally interface with linear systems tools. Third, methods for directed connectivity grounded in linear systems/Granger causality (Barnett & Seth) showed that impulse responses and transfer functions quantify information flow; the authors embed these objects inside a nonlinear multi-region model, enabling interpretability while retaining expressive intra-region dynamics. As a direct baseline, multi-population recurrent switching LDS (Glaser et al.) modeled inter-population interactions but with instantaneous, mode-dependent linear couplings; the present approach addresses those limitations by learning temporally extended channels and nonlinear local dynamics. Semedo et al.\u2019s communication subspace crystallized the scientific aim\u2014characterizing inter-areal communication\u2014while highlighting the gap in temporal modeling that the proposed impulse-response channels explicitly fill.",
