  "synthesis_narrative": "Stochastic differential equations can encode causal structure through their coefficients: which coordinates enter each other\u2019s differentials determines directed dependencies and naturally allows self-loops, as formalized by Mogensen and Hansen. Beyond pointwise conditioning, Didelez introduced local independence for continuous-time processes, articulating conditional independence constraints over time intervals that align with the way information flows in continuous time. When variables are partially observed, Richardson\u2019s acyclic directed mixed graphs and m-separation provide the correct graphical semantics for ancestral targets under marginalization and latent confounding. In time series, PCMCI demonstrated how leveraging temporal ordering within CI-based discovery boosts orientation power, but its discrete-time lag framework and lack of principled latent-variable handling leave gaps for continuous-time systems. On the statistical testing side, Fukumizu et al. grounded conditional independence in operators on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, enabling consistent nonparametric CI tests, with Zhang et al. providing a practical KCI procedure widely used in causal discovery. For sequential data, Salvi and collaborators developed signature kernels, yielding characteristic, efficiently computable embeddings of entire paths suitable for hypothesis testing on processes. Bringing these threads together, a natural opportunity emerges: define CI constraints tailored to SDE-induced dependence graphs over selected intervals and use them for sound, complete causal discovery of ancestral graphs\u2014even under partial observation\u2014while supplying a practical oracle by marrying RKHS CI testing with signature kernels to handle path-valued variables. This synthesis replaces discrete lag models with SDE-native interval CIs, exploits time directionality for unique orientation, and supplies a consistent, flexible CI test that operates directly on trajectory segments.",

    "abstract": "Inferring the causal structure underlying stochastic dynamical systems from observational data holds great promise in domains ranging from science and health to finance. Such processes can often be accurately modeled via stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which naturally imply causal relationships via `which variables enter the differential of which other variables'. In this paper, we develop conditional independence (CI) constraints on coordinate processes over selected intervals that are Markov with respect to the acyclic dependence graph (allowing self-loops) induced by a general SDE model. We then provide a sound and complete causal discovery algorithm, capable of handling both fully and partially observed data, and uniquely recovering the underlying or induced ancestral graph by exploiting time directionality assuming a CI oracle. Finally, to make our algorithm practically usable, we also propose a flexible, consistent signature kernel-based CI test to infer these constrain",
