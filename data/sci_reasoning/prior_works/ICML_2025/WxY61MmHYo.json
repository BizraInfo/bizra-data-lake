  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014deriving scaling laws for brain alignment across the primate ventral stream and exposing a divergence between behavioral and neural predictivity with scale\u2014builds directly on three pillars. First, goal-driven modeling of vision (Yamins et al., 2014) established that task-optimized ANNs can approximate primate IT, setting the conceptual basis for testing how increasing task-optimized capacity translates into neural and behavioral alignment. Second, integrative benchmarking (Schrimpf et al., 2018) and image-level behavioral comparisons (Rajalingham et al., 2018) supplied the standardized V1\u2013V2\u2013V4\u2013IT and behavior metrics and prior observations that accuracy gains need not improve brain-likeness, motivating a systematic, controlled exploration of scale. Third, empirical scaling-law methodology from machine learning (Hestness et al., 2017; Kaplan et al., 2020) provided the analytical framework to vary compute, parameters, and data in a principled manner and to characterize predictable trends and saturation points.\nComplementing these pillars, advances in architectural inductive biases (Dapello et al., 2020) demonstrated that embedding neuro-inspired front-ends can improve brain similarity and compute-efficiency, a theme the present study substantiates by showing that models with stronger inductive biases and higher-quality training images achieve higher brain alignment per unit compute. Finally, methodological work linking model features to primate neural responses in early cortex (Cadena et al., 2019) enabled robust multi-area neural predictivity estimates, revealing the key result: behavioral alignment continues to improve with scale while neural alignment, especially in earlier areas, saturates. Together, these works directly shaped the study\u2019s design and its central insights about where and how scaling helps models approximate the primate ventral stream.",
