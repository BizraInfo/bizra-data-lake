  "synthesis_narrative": "MVDiffusion\u2019s core contribution\u2014jointly generating multiple, geometrically consistent views with correspondence-aware attention\u2014emerges from converging lines of work in diffusion modeling, conditioning, and multi-view synthesis. Latent Diffusion Models provided the practical, high-resolution text-to-image backbone and cross-attention interface that MVDiffusion reuses, enabling insertion of new modules without sacrificing image quality. In parallel, video diffusion research (e.g., Video Diffusion Models) established that augmenting 2D UNets with inter-frame attention promotes consistency across frames; MVDiffusion adapts this idea from time to viewpoint, replacing generic temporal coupling with correspondence-aware cross-view attention driven by known pixel mappings. ControlNet showed how to inject structural signals like depth while freezing the base generator, a principle mirrored in MVDiffusion\u2019s integration of geometry and correspondences as auxiliary pathways rather than retraining the core model. On the application side, MultiDiffusion demonstrated panorama generation by fusing overlapping tiles, highlighting local inconsistency and stitching artifacts that MVDiffusion overcomes by globally co-sampling all views. The limitations of sequential warp-and-inpaint pipelines\u2014represented by SynSin and diffusion inpainting methods like RePaint\u2014underscore the error accumulation MVDiffusion explicitly avoids by abandoning iterative refinement for simultaneous generation. Finally, DreamFusion revealed that a 2D diffusion prior can enforce multi-view coherence for 3D, conceptually motivating MVDiffusion\u2019s 2D-only but correspondence-guided route to multi-view consistency without expensive 3D optimization.",
