  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of 3D-SGRL\u2014injecting geometric subequivariance into graph-based actor\u2013critic policies for morphology-agnostic locomotion\u2014stands on two converging lines of work: morphology-agnostic policy architectures and geometric equivariance. NerveNet established the now-standard representation of articulated robots as graphs and demonstrated transferable, message-passing policies across bodies, while Devin et al. introduced the broader vision of modular policies that generalize across tasks and robots. 3D-SGRL inherits this morphology-agnostic graph-policy formulation and targets generalization across diverse bodies and configurations.\nOn the geometric side, Cohen and Welling\u2019s group-equivariant framework catalyzed the practice of hard-coding symmetry into neural architectures. EGNNs and SE(3)-Transformers translated this principle to 3D graphs and attention, respectively, showcasing performance gains when full E(n)/SE(3) symmetry holds. However, 3D locomotion with gravity, contacts, and terrain violates full SE(3) symmetry. 3D-SGRL explicitly identifies this mismatch and resolves it by enforcing only the valid subgroup symmetries\u2014subequivariance\u2014so the policy and Q-function generalize over directions without imposing unrealistic invariances.\nFinally, the work directly extends Chen et al.\u2019s SGRL beyond planar benchmarks: it scales the subequivariant mechanism to 3D, redesigns the symmetry constraints around gravity-consistent subgroups, and introduces new 3D benchmarks with arbitrary starts/goals. In combination, these prior works provided the morphology-agnostic graph-policy scaffold, the mathematical machinery of equivariance, and the key limitation (overly strict full equivariance) that 3D-SGRL overcomes.",
