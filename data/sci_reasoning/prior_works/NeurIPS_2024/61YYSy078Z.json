  "synthesis_narrative": "ECLipsE\u2019s core contribution\u2014transforming a single, large SDP for global Lipschitz estimation into a set of small, layer-sized SDPs that compose along the network cascade\u2014sits squarely at the intersection of two lines of prior work: SDP-based verification and compositional Lipschitz analysis. The SDP foundation was laid by robustness certification methods that encode ReLU (or slope-restricted) nonlinearities with quadratic constraints, culminating in large matrix verification problems (Raghunathan et al.; Fawzi et al.). Fazlyab et al. then specialized this paradigm to bounding global Lipschitz constants via an SDP that is tight but increasingly expensive for deep or wide networks. In parallel, Virmaux and Scaman popularized efficient, compositional layer-wise bounds, trading tightness for scalability by relying on operator norms and activation gating heuristics. ECLipsE merges these threads: it retains the principled quadratic-constraint geometry of SDP approaches, but introduces an exact decomposition aligned with the network\u2019s cascade structure, yielding small SDPs\u2014each sized by a single layer\u2014whose solutions compose to a global certificate. Classical IQC theory (Megretski & Rantzer) underpins this move, providing the formal mechanism to distribute certificates across interconnected subsystems. Finally, accurate operator-norm analyses for linear layers (e.g., convolutional spectral norms from Sedghi et al.) can be seamlessly incorporated into the per-layer subproblems, helping ECLipsE match the tightness of global SDPs with the efficiency of compositional methods.",
