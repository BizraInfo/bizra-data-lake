  "synthesis_narrative": "Vist\u2019s core innovation\u2014rendering distant tokens into images for a vision-driven fast path while reserving an LLM slow path for proximal, high-precision reasoning\u2014emerges from converging lines of prior work. The slow\u2013fast decomposition is architecturally motivated by SlowFast, which demonstrated the efficiency and accuracy benefits of asymmetric dual-path processing. To make a vision-based fast path viable, Flamingo and BLIP-2 provide the critical blueprint: use a frozen, lightweight vision encoder and a small learned bottleneck (Perceiver Resampler or Q-Former) to distill high-dimensional visual inputs into compact tokens that an LLM can ingest. Donut further substantiates that semantics of text can be preserved when the text is rendered as images and processed by vision backbones, validating Vist\u2019s decision to visually encode distant context rather than keep it as raw tokens.\n\nOn the selection and compression side, TokenLearner shows that learnable token selection can concentrate representational capacity on informative regions\u2014an idea Vist adapts when training its resampler to focus on semantically rich parts of the rendered context. Skim-RNN contributes the selective reading principle: spend computation where it matters and skim the rest, directly reflected in Vist\u2019s slow\u2013fast routing policy. Finally, the PVE objective\u2019s masking of high-frequency terms is grounded in the TF\u2013IDF tradition of discounting common words to elevate informative content, giving Vist a principled, probability-informed signal to guide what the visual resampler should prioritize. Together, these works directly shape Vist\u2019s vision-centric token compression pipeline and training objective.",
