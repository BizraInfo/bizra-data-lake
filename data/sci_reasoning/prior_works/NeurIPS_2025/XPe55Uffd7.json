  "synthesis_narrative": "This paper resolves a central open question in agnostic active learning by proving a sharp, distribution-free characterization of first-order query complexity for all VC classes, and by exhibiting an algorithm that achieves it. The path to this result runs through the disagreement-based tradition inaugurated in agnostic form by Balcan, Beygelzimer, and Langford (2006), and systematized in Hanneke\u2019s 2014 monograph, where label complexity was governed by the disagreement coefficient. Although broadly applicable, those guarantees only ensured improvements over passive learning when such complexity measures were small. IWAL (Beygelzimer\u2013Dasgupta\u2013Langford, 2009) offered a general-purpose agnostic algorithm with unbiased estimation, but its bounds also retained extra multiplicative factors. Earlier structural analyses, notably Dasgupta\u2019s 2005 work on the splitting index, likewise yielded conditional gains tied to specific geometric or distributional properties. Rate-focused advances (Hanneke, 2011) clarified the distinction between first- and second-order behavior and connected improvements to noise/margin conditions, while minimax studies (Castro\u2013Nowak, 2008) demonstrated potential active gains under such assumptions. Building on these strands, the present paper removes disagreement/splitting-index factors from the leading term entirely and proves a universal first-order advantage: active learning always beats passive learning by a factor proportional to the best-in-class error. Conceptually rooted in the CAL/version-space paradigm (Cohn\u2013Atlas\u2013Ladner, 1994), the new algorithm realizes this optimality generically, thereby closing the gap between prior conditional analyses and an unconditional, class-wide guarantee in the agnostic setting.",
