  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014minimax-optimal error bounds and strong consistency for vector-valued random-features ridge regression in a fully general (possibly infinite-dimensional) input\u2013output setting\u2014rests on three intertwined lines of prior work. First, Rahimi and Recht introduced random features and the RF ridge estimator that is the object of analysis. Building on this, Rudi and Rosasco developed sharp generalization and feature/sample complexity guarantees for scalar-valued RF via random matrix/operator concentration. Bach reframed RF as a quadrature problem for kernel integral operators, enabling direct excess-risk control that circumvents explicit manipulation of random Gram matrices. The present paper adopts and extends this risk-functional perspective to obtain bounds that avoid random matrix theory altogether.\n\nSecond, classical kernel ridge regression theory\u2014especially Caponnetto and De Vito\u2019s minimax rates under source/capacity assumptions and Steinwart\u2013Hush\u2013Scovel\u2019s treatment of well- and misspecified regimes\u2014provides the spectral conditions and target benchmarks. The new results show that RF can match these optimal KRR rates while clarifying the required sample and parameter complexities.\n\nThird, the extension to vector- and Hilbert-space\u2013valued outputs leverages the operator-valued RKHS framework developed by Micchelli\u2013Pontil and by Carmeli\u2013De Vito\u2013Toigo, which formalizes multioutput regression, operator-valued kernels, and universality. These works supply the functional-analytic setting in which the paper\u2019s excess-risk analysis, consistency statements, and spectral conditions are formulated and proved.",
