  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution is a principled way to endow latent embeddings with algebraic operations that provably satisfy desired laws (e.g., associativity) by transporting structure through a learned bijection to a carefully crafted Euclidean \u2018mirrored algebra.\u2019 Two strands of prior work directly enable this. First, coupling-based normalizing flows like RealNVP and their scalable variants such as Glow provide the practical, expressive, and invertible neural mappings required to learn a diffeomorphism between latent space and Euclidean space. These architectures make the transport of algebraic structure feasible end-to-end. Second, a conceptual lineage from structure-respecting architectures\u2014exemplified by Group Equivariant CNNs and DeepSets\u2014demonstrates that enforcing algebraic laws by design (group equivariance, monoid sums) yields models with guaranteed properties. The present work generalizes this idea: instead of hardwiring a specific law into the network computations, it constructs an algebra on Euclidean space and pulls it back through a learned bijection to the latent space.\nComplementing these are application-driven and geometric precedents. DeepSDF crystallized the use of latent implicit surface representations in which boolean set operations are natural, motivating the need for lawful latent operations like union and intersection. Finally, work on the geometry of deep generative models formalized transporting structure (e.g., Riemannian metrics) via learned maps, providing the mathematical template for pulling back algebraic operations. Together, these works converge to make structural transport nets both principled and practical.",
