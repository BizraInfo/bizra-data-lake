  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s central contribution\u2014an encryption scheme that preserves the minimum Gini impurity needed for split selection in random forests\u2014rests on three intertwined threads of prior work. First, CART and Random Forests established the learning mechanics and the primacy of Gini impurity in split decisions. This work targets that precise quantity, aiming to keep the training dynamics intact even under encryption.\nSecond, the paper builds on the property-preserving encryption lineage inaugurated by Order-Preserving Encryption and refined by Order-Revealing Encryption. These works showed that selective exposure of structure (e.g., order) can enable efficient algorithms over ciphertexts. The present paper generalizes this ethos from preserving comparisons to preserving an algorithmic objective: the argmin of Gini impurity across candidate splits. Its modification of the search-tree structure (storing multiple samples per node and encoding order/label relationships) echoes the design philosophy of tailoring encryption to the computation\u2019s invariants while managing leakage.\nThird, prior efforts in privacy-preserving trees over encrypted or distributed data\u2014Bost et al.\u2019s encrypted model evaluation and Vaidya\u2013Clifton\u2019s secure computation of split statistics\u2014demonstrated feasibility but did not guarantee that the impurity optimum is discoverable directly from ciphertexts without decryption. By combining a Gini-preserving feature encryption with CKKS for labels, the paper delivers a practical, theoretically justified pathway to private random forest training that preserves the core split-selection criterion, bridging the gap between secure computation protocols and property-preserving encryption tailored to tree induction.",
