  "synthesis_narrative": "AERCA\u2019s intellectual lineage fuses classic Granger causality with intervention-based views of anomalies and modern learnable causal discovery. The foundation is Granger\u2019s 1969 definition of temporal causality, which AERCA explicitly learns among variables and then exploits for attribution. Box and Tiao\u2019s intervention analysis provides the conceptual bridge to anomaly-centric reasoning: viewing irregular events as exogenous shocks to the generative mechanism. Building practical discovery machinery draws on sparse Granger frameworks such as Lozano et al.\u2019s grouped-lasso VAR, which established identifiable, scalable Granger graph recovery in high dimensions. Hyv\u00e4rinen et al.\u2019s SVAR work is a key inspiration for AERCA\u2019s core innovation: modeling the distributional properties of exogenous shocks. By characterizing the innovations under normal conditions, AERCA can flag departures as the sources of observed anomalies, paralleling the idea that non-Gaussian or distributional structure of shocks enables identification. Modern neural approaches\u2014Tank et al.\u2019s Neural Granger Causality and Nauta et al.\u2019s TCDF\u2014inform AERCA\u2019s differentiable causal discovery component, but neither links discovered structure to exogenous-intervention deviations for root cause analysis. Finally, graph-based anomaly detectors like GDN expose a gap: they model dependencies for detection but lack causal direction and principled attribution. AERCA directly addresses this by jointly discovering Granger-causal structure and learning normal innovation distributions, enabling precise, causally grounded root cause identification.",
