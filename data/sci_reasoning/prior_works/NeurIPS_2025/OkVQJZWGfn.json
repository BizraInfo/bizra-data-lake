  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014a statistical theory showing improved sample complexity under Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision via a new CoT information measure\u2014sits at the intersection of empirical advances in reasoning and classical learning theory on side information and information-theoretic bounds. Empirically, Wei et al. (2022) established that exposing intermediate reasoning steps substantially boosts LLM performance, motivating a principled account of why such supervision can accelerate learning. Earlier lines of work on auxiliary supervision directly inform this: Abu-Mostafa\u2019s Hints (1993) and Vapnik & Vashist\u2019s LUPI paradigm (2009) formalize how training-time-only signals can shrink hypothesis ambiguity and yield faster rates\u2014precisely the lens through which CoT steps can be viewed. Zaidan et al. (2007) demonstrated that human rationales improve sample efficiency, providing an immediate precursor for treating CoT as a structured supervisory signal rather than mere explanations. To translate these intuitions into rates, Bartlett, Bousquet, and Mendelson (2005) supplied machinery for fast rates via localized complexity and noise/variance conditions, which the present paper echoes by relating separability induced by CoT to sharper upper bounds. Hanneke\u2019s theory of disagreement-based active learning (2014) contributes a conceptual blueprint: define a problem-dependent quantity that measures how extra information separates hypotheses, then tie it to label/sample savings\u2014mirrored here by CoT information. Finally, Yu (1997) offers the information-theoretic toolkit (Fano/Le Cam/Assouad) enabling lower bounds that match the upper-bound dependence on CoT information, completing a tight characterization of when CoT supervision provably speeds learning.",
