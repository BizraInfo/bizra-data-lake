  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014a universal critic for quantifying realism\u2014emerges from unifying adversarial evaluation with algorithmic information theory. Goodfellow et al. established adversarial critics as the practical baseline for realism, yet their dependence on a particular generator and training game leaves conceptual gaps. Theis et al. exposed a deeper problem: generative modeling performance and perceptual realism can diverge, so a strong generator does not automatically yield a robust realism measure. To articulate what a principled solution should be, the paper returns to foundational AIT. Solomonoff\u2019s universal mixture and Kolmogorov\u2019s description-length framework formalize the ideal of judgments grounded in universal induction and minimal code length, while Martin-L\u00f6f\u2019s universal randomness tests provide the precise template: a single test that dominates all computable tests. Translating this to images, the universal critic is a generator-agnostic test for realism that, in principle, supersedes any learned discriminator without adversarial training. Rissanen\u2019s MDL principle then supplies the practical compass: approximate the intractable ideal via coding and model selection machinery. Finally, the work positions itself against popular metrics like FID (Heusel et al.), explaining through the universal-critic lens why feature-dependent distances conflate realism with coverage and cannot be definitive. Together, these works directly shape the paper\u2019s central thesis and its proposed North Star for evaluating realism.",
