  "synthesis_narrative": "VolSDF established a principled way to map signed distance values to volumetric densities, enabling surface-accurate rendering and supervision within an SDF framework. NeuS refined SDF volume rendering and exposed a practical training recipe, while also revealing a tendency toward vanishing gradients and over-smoothed geometry away from the zero level set. IGR introduced eikonal regularization to enforce valid signed distance geometry and popularized near-surface sampling to stabilize SDF learning. UNISURF analyzed the trade-offs between occupancy- and SDF-based formulations and advocated surface-focused rendering to better localize geometry. MonoSDF injected monocular depth/normal cues into SDF learning, improving indoor reconstructions but still leaving high-frequency object details under-recovered. Complementarily, Object-NeRF demonstrated that decomposing scenes into object and background components can disentangle geometry and appearance, suggesting architectural and training strategies that treat object regions differently for finer reconstructions. Neuralangelo, targeting high-fidelity geometry, further underscored the broader challenge of retaining high-frequency detail in neural implicit surfaces. Together these works crystalized a gap: SDF-based renderers excel at clean surfaces and global structure but struggle to balance large, planar room layouts with intricate object detail due to gradient sparsity near fine-scale geometry. H2O-SDF synthesizes these insights by retaining SDF rendering and eikonal regularization, explicitly separating object and non-object regions as inspired by object-compositional fields, and introducing an Object Surface Field with a two-phase training schedule to concentrate learning signals where objects require high-frequency detail while preserving the integrity of room layouts.",

    "abstract": "Advanced techniques using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), Signed Distance Fields (SDF), and Occupancy Fields have recently emerged as solutions for 3D indoor scene reconstruction. We introduce a novel two-phase learning approach, H2O-SDF,  that discriminates between object and non-object regions within indoor environments. This method achieves a nuanced balance, carefully preserving the geometric integrity of room layouts while also capturing intricate surface details of specific objects. A cornerstone of our two-phase learning framework is the introduction of the Object Surface Field (OSF), a novel concept designed to mitigate the persistent vanishing gradient problem that has previously hindered the capture of high-frequency details in other methods. Our proposed approach is validated through several experiments that include ablation studies.",
