  "synthesis_narrative": "The intellectual lineage of MultiDimSPCI traces from the foundations of conformal prediction to modern adaptations for non-exchangeable time series and multivariate outputs. Vovk et al. established the conformal paradigm\u2014nonconformity scoring and finite-sample coverage\u2014that underpins the method\u2019s distribution-free guarantees, while Lei et al. provided the split conformal recipe that MultiDimSPCI uses in a sequential calibration scheme. Addressing the central challenge of non-exchangeability in time series, Tibshirani et al. demonstrated how weighting can retain validity under distribution shift, a key insight that informs MultiDimSPCI\u2019s sequential treatment of dependent data. On the application side, Romano et al.\u2019s conformalized quantile regression remains a primary univariate baseline for forecasting; its limitation to scalar intervals motivates MultiDimSPCI\u2019s joint prediction regions. EnbPI is a strong time-series baseline from the same research thread, but it, too, is inherently univariate\u2014MultiDimSPCI advances beyond it by constructing multivariate, volume-efficient regions with provable high-probability conditional coverage bounds. Technically, the method\u2019s ellipsoidal regions are inspired by classical Hotelling prediction ellipses, realized here through a Mahalanobis-type nonconformity score and conformal calibration to remain distribution-free. Finally, MultiDimSPCI is a direct extension of the authors\u2019 sequential predictive conformal inference (SPCI), generalizing its sequential calibration to vector-valued responses and yielding finite-sample guarantees tailored to multivariate time series.",
