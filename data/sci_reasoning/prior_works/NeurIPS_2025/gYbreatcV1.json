  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper positions itself at the intersection of classical non-clairvoyant flow-time scheduling and learning-augmented online algorithms. It roots its model in the seminal non-clairvoyant framework of Motwani\u2013Phillips\u2013Torng, but augments the information structure: instead of no size information, the scheduler receives evolving progress signals. To analyze such algorithms, the work draws on the dual-fitting and resource augmentation toolkit of Bansal\u2013Pruhs, tailoring these methods to accommodate time-varying, potentially adversarial progress bars.\n\nOn the learning-augmented side, the paper explicitly inherits the consistency/robustness goals introduced by Lykouris\u2013Vassilvitskii and operationalized across problems by Purohit\u2013Svitkina\u2013Kumar. Prior scheduling-with-predictions results (e.g., Lattanzi\u2013Lavastida\u2013Moseley\u2013Vassilvitskii) provide baselines and error-dependent guarantees for job-size predictions; the authors show that adversarial progress bars strictly strengthen these guarantees, effectively subsuming one-shot size predictions. Their \"algorithm-combining\" method mirrors meta-designs from prediction-aware scheduling (e.g., Im\u2013Moseley\u2013Purohit\u2013Svensson), but generalizes them to blend multiple flow-time algorithms under continuous feedback while preserving worst-case safety.\n\nFinally, the stochastic progress-bar model connects to classical clairvoyant optimality: as signals become more informative, policies gravitate toward SRPT (Schrage), and the authors prove asymptotic optimality against this gold standard. Collectively, these prior works shape the paper\u2019s core innovation: elevating non-clairvoyant scheduling from static ignorance or single-shot predictions to continuous, analyzable feedback\u2014yielding stronger adversarial guarantees, principled algorithm combination, and stochastic optimality.",
