  "synthesis_narrative": "LM-Design\u2019s core innovation is to reprogram a pretrained protein language model with a lightweight structural adapter so it can perform structure-conditioned sequence design. This builds on two complementary lines of work. First, sequence-only protein language models such as ESM-1b established that large-scale pretraining captures evolutionary and structural regularities in sequences, and ProGen demonstrated that such models can generate realistic, functional proteins\u2014suggesting pLMs can act as protein designers. Second, the inverse folding community, from RosettaDesign through graph-based neural approaches, defined the backbone-conditioned design problem and benchmarks (e.g., CATH 4.2/4.3). In particular, Ingraham et al. framed inverse folding as graph-conditioned sequence generation, and GVP-GNN provided strong geometric baselines and canonical evaluation splits. The immediate SOTA at the time, ProteinMPNN, achieved high recovery by relying purely on structural information, exposing a key gap: structure-only models ignore the vast evolutionary knowledge embedded in pLMs. LM-Design closes this gap by importing the adapter concept from parameter-efficient transfer learning\u2014training small modules within an otherwise frozen transformer\u2014and specializing it to inject 3D structural cues into a sequence pLM. By combining the evolutionary priors of pLMs with explicit structural conditioning and adding iterative refinement at inference, LM-Design surpasses GVP-GNN and ProteinMPNN on standard inverse-folding benchmarks and extends effectively to complexes, realizing the long-standing goal of unifying sequence-based evolutionary information with structure-based design.",
