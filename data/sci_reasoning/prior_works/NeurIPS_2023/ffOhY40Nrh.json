  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s central advance\u2014showing that predicting the future in the latent space of vision models provides a better account of neural and behavioral signatures of mental simulation than pixel-wise or naive scaling\u2014sits at the intersection of goal-driven neuroscience and latent world modeling. Yamins et al. (2014) established that optimizing networks for task goals can yield brain-like internal representations; this paper extends that recipe from static object recognition to dynamic scene prediction. It leverages the benchmarking ethos of Rajalingham et al. (2018) and Schrimpf et al. (2020) by jointly comparing models to dense neurophysiology and large-scale human behavioral judgments, providing the high-throughput adjudication necessary to test competing computational hypotheses.\n\nOn the modeling side, Ha and Schmidhuber\u2019s World Models and Hafner et al.\u2019s PlaNet supplied the crucial algorithmic insight that learning and forecasting in a compact latent space can enable accurate long-horizon prediction and planning. The current work adapts that idea to contemporary vision backbones, explicitly testing whether forecasting pretrained feature latents best captures mental simulation-related computations. Parallel lines in object-centric modeling\u2014epitomized by Locatello et al.\u2019s Slot Attention and Watters et al.\u2019s Visual Interaction Networks\u2014motivated comparisons between pixel-level, object-slot, and latent-feature prediction objectives. By systematically pitting these families of models against neural and behavioral data, the authors demonstrate that objective and representation choice\u2014not mere model scale\u2014critically determine alignment with the brain\u2019s dynamic physical scene understanding.",
