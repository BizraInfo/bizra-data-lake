  "synthesis_narrative": "PTA\u2019s core idea\u2014reliable test-time learning under multi-modal domain shifts\u2014sits at the intersection of entropy-based TTA, class-bias correction, curriculum-style reweighting, and attention-driven multimodal alignment. Tent established entropy minimization as a simple, effective TTA objective, but is vulnerable to biased predictions and collapse; PTA directly extends this objective with debiased, reliability-aware weighting to avoid overfitting to skewed test batches. SHOT contributed the source-free adaptation paradigm and information-maximization spirit that PTA preserves while removing reliance on source data. To combat prediction bias, CBST\u2019s class-balanced pseudo-labeling provided the key insight that selection must consider class-frequency skew; PTA operationalizes this by comparing per-sample predicted label frequency to the batch average. This connects to classic label-shift correction (Saerens et al.), which formalized adjusting posteriors to new priors; PTA uses batch-level frequency cues as a practical, online proxy. For robust selection, PTA\u2019s quantile-based debiased reweighting echoes self-paced learning\u2019s curriculum principle, emphasizing reliable, confident samples while downweighting dubious ones. Finally, the multi-modal Attention-Guided Alignment draws on cross-modal attention from LXMERT to align complementary signals across modalities, and on ModDrop\u2019s robustness ethos to reduce the influence of degraded modalities. Together, these threads yield a partition-then-adapt scheme that learns from reliable subsets, suppresses biased signals, and aligns modalities to deliver stable gains under simultaneous multi-modal shifts.",
