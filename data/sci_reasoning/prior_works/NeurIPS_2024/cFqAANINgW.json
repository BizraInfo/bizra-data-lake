  "synthesis_narrative": "FunCoder\u2019s key contribution\u2014combining divide-and-conquer code generation with functional consensus\u2014emerges from two converging lines of prior work: structured decomposition for reasoning/program synthesis and consensus/feedback mechanisms to enhance reliability. On the decomposition side, Decomposed Prompting and Least-to-Most Prompting showed that breaking complex tasks into modular or curricular subproblems improves solution quality. Tree of Thoughts generalized this into an explicit search over branching solution paths. FunCoder instantiates these insights in the code domain by recursively proposing sub-functions and composing them, creating a tree-structured plan that localizes complexity and reduces error cascades. From the program synthesis community, DreamCoder provided a principled precedent for introducing and reusing functional abstractions to scale to harder tasks, reinforcing FunCoder\u2019s function-centric design. On the reliability side, Self-Consistency demonstrated that aggregating multiple solution candidates via voting improves robustness, while AlphaCode operationalized a behavior-centric variant\u2014sampling many programs and clustering/selecting them by unit-test behavior. FunCoder fuses these notions with its functional consensus: it groups candidate sub-functions by behavioral similarity to choose consistent building blocks, mitigating propagation of early errors. Finally, Reflexion\u2019s feedback-driven refinement informs FunCoder\u2019s iterative self-tests and revisions at the function level. Together, these works directly enable FunCoder\u2019s core innovation: a hierarchical, function-first generation process whose correctness is stabilized by behavior-based consensus.",
