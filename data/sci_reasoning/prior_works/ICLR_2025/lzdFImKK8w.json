  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core idea\u2014Boltzmann Alignment of inverse-folding log-likelihoods to predict \u0394\u0394G for protein\u2013protein interactions\u2014arises from unifying thermodynamic principles with advances in structure-conditioned generative modeling. SKEMPI 2.0 formalized the PPI \u0394\u0394G task and, by highlighting data scarcity, motivated leveraging pretrained models rather than purely supervised training. Physics-based methods such as Rosetta Flex ddG grounded \u0394\u0394G prediction in the thermodynamic cycle, but their reliance on explicit conformational sampling is computationally intensive. DeepSequence provided the conceptual bridge that differences in model log-likelihoods can act as statistical energies reflecting mutational impact, suggesting a route to energy prediction without direct simulation. In parallel, inverse folding was established by Ingraham et al., who modeled p(sequence|structure) and interpreted negative log-likelihood as a sequence \u2018energy\u2019 for a given backbone; subsequent high-capacity models such as ProteinMPNN and ESM-IF1 delivered strong, calibrated log-likelihoods conditioned on structure. Prior uses of these scores for mutation assessment, however, lacked a principled thermodynamic alignment to binding free energy and did not account for conformational ensembles. The present work combines the Boltzmann distribution with Bayes\u2019 theorem to re-express intractable p(structure|sequence) ratios in terms of accessible p(sequence|structure) likelihoods from inverse folding, thereby directly aligning statistical energies to \u0394\u0394G. This addresses limitations of feature-engineered predictors like SAAMBE-3D and computationally heavy physics methods, yielding a data-efficient, thermodynamically grounded estimator of mutational effects on PPIs.",
