  "synthesis_narrative": "G2MILP\u2019s core innovation\u2014learning to generate realistic MILP instances from limited data via a masked variational autoencoder on bipartite graphs\u2014stands at the intersection of MILP-specific graph modeling and modern masked generative learning. The bipartite encoding of MILPs introduced by Gasse et al. provides the precise structural substrate: variables and constraints as node types with coefficients as edges. This representation has become the de facto interface for applying GNNs in MILP and enables G2MILP to manipulate and reconstruct semantically meaningful subgraphs.\n\nOn the generative side, variational approaches for graphs (VGAE) and their instantiation for discrete graph generation (GraphVAE) demonstrate that latent-variable models can capture global graph distributions while decoding valid discrete structures. These works directly motivate G2MILP\u2019s choice of a VAE-style latent space and graph-aware decoders rather than purely autoregressive sequence models. While GraphRNN established strong baselines for modeling complex graph dependencies, G2MILP departs from its sequential generation by adopting a masked, parallel refinement procedure.\n\nFinally, the learning and sampling mechanics of G2MILP are inspired by masked modeling paradigms: BERT\u2019s corrupt-and-reconstruct objective and MAE\u2019s high-ratio masking show that masking can yield robust representation learning under data scarcity and support iterative fill-in strategies. By transferring these ideas from text and vision to MILP bipartite graphs, G2MILP leverages masked denoising to iteratively replace subgraphs, yielding diverse, valid, and solver-relevant MILP instances without hand-crafted generators.",
