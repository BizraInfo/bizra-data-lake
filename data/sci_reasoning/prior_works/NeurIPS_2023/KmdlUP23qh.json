  "synthesis_narrative": "The core contribution of GIW is to generalize importance weighting (IW) into a universal solver that remains valid when test support extends beyond training support or only partially overlaps. This builds directly on the covariate-shift foundation established by Shimodaira\u2019s IW, and on practical IW training procedures such as importance-weighted cross-validation. GIW retains the IW machinery on the in-training (overlap) region and therefore depends on reliable density-ratio estimation\u2014canonical methods like Kernel Mean Matching and uLSIF provide the operational backbone for estimating weights.\n\nHowever, prior theory has long warned that IW\u2019s variance and generalization deteriorate when support assumptions are violated. The generalization bounds of Cortes, Mansour, and Mohri formalize the instability and tail sensitivity of importance weights, clarifying why standard IW fails when the target has probability mass where the source has none. GIW addresses this failure by explicitly partitioning the target domain into in-training and out-of-training regions and devising estimators for each part.\n\nThe design of risk estimators for regions lacking labeled coverage is inspired by risk-rewriting ideas from Positive\u2013Unlabeled learning, where one reconstructs target risk from components available under limited supervision. Complementarily, the off-policy evaluation literature\u2019s doubly robust estimators motivate combining weighting-based estimation on the overlap with alternative, model-driven terms where overlap is absent. Integrating these strands, GIW reduces to classical IW when supports match or nest, while providing principled, low-variance estimation in the unsupported regions\u2014thus unifying and extending IW to all common distribution-shift cases.",
