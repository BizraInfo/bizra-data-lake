  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of HDT is to relocate history dependence from the transition kernel to the target distribution, thereby retaining the variance-flattening benefits of self-repulsion while eliminating SRRW\u2019s computational and reversibility constraints. SRRW is the immediate baseline: it demonstrated that prioritizing under-sampled states via history-dependent kernels can achieve near-zero variance on graphs, but at the cost of expensive neighbor-wise probability updates and a reliance on reversible dynamics. HDT\u2019s design is directly inspired by the flat-histogram lineage beginning with Wang\u2013Landau, which adaptively biases the target to equalize visitation frequencies, and is operationalized using stochastic-approximation updates as in SAMC. The formal SA-MCMC perspective of Atchad\u00e9\u2013Liu extends these ideas to general state spaces with convergence analysis, providing the theoretical footing for an evolving, history-driven target within a valid MCMC framework. Crucially, by decoupling adaptation from the kernel, HDT resolves SRRW\u2019s key gap: incompatibility with nonreversible accelerations. Foundational results on lifting and non-backtracking random walks show that nonreversible dynamics can markedly speed mixing on graphs, and practical samplers like Suwa\u2013Todo exploit this in MCMC. HDT\u2019s target-centric adaptation makes these nonreversible kernels immediately usable, yielding near-zero variance sampling with substantially lower per-step overhead across general undirected graphs.",
