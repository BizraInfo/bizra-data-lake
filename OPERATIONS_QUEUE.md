# OPERATIONS QUEUE — Home Base Cleanup & Hardening

## 2) Security & Footprint Reduction (Requires approval)
- [ ] Inventory installed apps + services (report first)

- [ ] Consolidate OneDrive → local (verify backups)
- [ ] Reduce email accounts 6 → 3 (2 business, 1 personal)
- [ ] Rotate all passwords (managed, staged rollout)

## 3) Codebase Validation
- [ ] Re‑run `pytest tests/core/` (verify any regressions)
- [ ] Triage known failures in `test_graph_reasoner.py` (prune function)
- [ ] Confirm elite/living/iaas suites remain green

## 4) Knowledge Base System (Core)
