  "synthesis_narrative": "Minimal Frame Averaging (MFA) emerges at the intersection of representation-theoretic equivariant deep learning and design theory. The conceptual groundwork is laid by Group Equivariant CNNs and the general theory on homogeneous spaces, which codified equivariance through group actions, intertwiners, and group convolutions\u2014implicitly relying on summations/integrals over group elements. Practical methods for continuous groups, such as LieConv, operationalized these ideas via numerical quadrature or sampling over Lie groups, but at the cost of approximate equivariance and nontrivial compute. In parallel, Augerino showed that sampling and averaging over learned transformation distributions can encourage invariance/equivariance, but again only approximately and with stochastic overhead. MFA\u2019s key step is to replace such large or sampled frames with finite, provably minimal sets that exactly reproduce the group average. This move is directly inspired by classical design theory\u2014Delsarte\u2019s spherical t-designs\u2014and its generalization to unitary t-designs by Dankert and collaborators, which guarantee exact Haar moment matching with finite sets. MFA adapts and extends these design principles into a practical, representation-aware construction of minimal frames for a broad class of groups, including the Lorentz and unitary groups. Against specialized Lorentz-equivariant baselines like the Lorentz Group Equivariant Neural Network, MFA offers a group-agnostic, computationally efficient route to exact equivariance, enabling state-of-the-art performance across physics and dynamics tasks while dramatically reducing the cost of frame averaging.",
