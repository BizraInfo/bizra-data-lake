  "synthesis_narrative": "CSIQA\u2019s core idea\u2014marrying global relative-quality context with local distortion sensitivity\u2014arises from two converging threads in BIQA. First, RankIQA and PaQ-2-PiQ established that relative comparisons are a natural and robust supervision signal for human quality perception. CSIQA builds on this foundation but moves beyond pairwise or listwise training to a global, dataset-level representation of quality relations by designing contrastive strategies that encode how images compare across the entire training set. Second, CONTRIQUE showed that contrastive learning can produce quality-aware features without relying solely on absolute MOS labels. CSIQA extends this contrastive paradigm by explicitly structuring positives/negatives around quality context rather than generic instance identity or distortion type, thereby capturing latent inter-image quality correlations the prior work leaves implicit.\nAt the same time, widely adopted absolute-regression systems such as NIMA and MUSIQ deliver strong performance but inherently ignore relational (global) cues; CSIQA directly addresses this gap by fusing a global contrastive objective with local prediction. Finally, attention-based BIQA advances typified by MANIQA highlight the value of attending to quality-relevant regions, yet lack explicit mechanisms to enforce local sensitivity under incomplete evidence. CSIQA modifies this attention line with a quality-aware mask attention module that uses random masking to force robustness and sharpen focus on distortion-critical patches. Together, these strands form the direct intellectual lineage of CSIQA\u2019s integrated global\u2013local BIQA paradigm.",
