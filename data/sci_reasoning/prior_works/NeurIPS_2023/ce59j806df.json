  "synthesis_narrative": "CWAEE\u2019s core innovations\u2014detecting unknown classes within unlabeled data and exploiting them via domain-shift-aware consistency\u2014sit at the intersection of open-set learning, semi-supervised learning, and domain generalization. On the exploration side, the method operationalizes the one-vs-rest paradigm with per-class thresholds, a design rooted in open-set recognition. DOC formalized one-vs-rest outputs with class-wise rejection, and CWAEE extends this idea to the SSDG setting where unlabeled data mix known and unknown categories across domains. OpenMatch further bridged open-set assumptions with semi-supervised consistency, showing that combining one-vs-all scoring with confidence control can safely utilize unlabeled data that include outliers; CWAEE generalizes this recipe to DG, grafting in class-level adaptivity. FlexMatch contributes the crucial mechanism of class-wise adaptive thresholds, helping CWAEE calibrate decisions across imbalanced or unevenly learned classes. \nOn the exploitation side, CWAEE builds on FixMatch\u2019s simple yet powerful consistency regularization, but replaces generic augmentations with Fourier-based ones inspired by FDA. FDA demonstrated that manipulating low-frequency amplitude alters style while preserving semantics, a property CWAEE leverages to simulate domain shifts during consistency training, thereby improving generalization to unseen domains. Finally, OSBP\u2019s open-set DA perspective motivates explicitly identifying and rejecting unknowns rather than forcing alignment, guiding CWAEE\u2019s exploration-exploitation split. Together, these works directly inform CWAEE\u2019s architectural choices (one-vs-rest), calibration (class-wise thresholds), learning objective (consistency), and augmentation strategy (Fourier), producing a targeted solution to SSDG with unknown classes.",
