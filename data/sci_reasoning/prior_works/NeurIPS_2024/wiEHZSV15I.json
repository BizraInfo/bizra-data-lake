  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014that carefully tailored decomposition can simultaneously deliver parsimony and state-of-the-art capability in long-term time series forecasting\u2014builds on a lineage of decomposition-centric ideas spanning classical statistics to modern deep learning. Holt\u2013Winters and STL established the foundational premise that time series can be profitably separated into trend and seasonal components, reducing modeling complexity and improving interpretability. Prophet operationalized this additive paradigm at industrial scale, reinforcing the value of modular component models tuned to the data\u2019s intrinsic dynamics.\nIn deep learning, N-BEATS showed that explicitly encoding trend/seasonality via learned bases can outperform heavier recurrent or attention architectures while retaining interpretability, seeding the notion that inductive bias can substitute for parameter count. Within LTSF, Autoformer and FEDformer embedded decomposition into Transformer pipelines (time and frequency domains), empirically confirming that disentangling components enhances long-horizon stability. However, these models still carry substantial parameter overhead. The DLinear study then crystallized a crucial insight: even minimal linear modules, when coupled with trend\u2013seasonal separation, can rival or surpass complex Transformers, highlighting decomposition as a primary driver of performance.\nSynthesizing these threads, the present paper elevates decomposition from a helpful block to the central modeling principle. It provides theoretical support for why decomposition curbs parameter inflation and proposes a data-adaptive decomposition mechanism that consistently outperforms heavyweight baselines while using over 99% fewer parameters\u2014achieving the dual goals of parsimony and capability.",
