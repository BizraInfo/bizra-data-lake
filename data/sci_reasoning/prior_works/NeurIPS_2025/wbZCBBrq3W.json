  "synthesis_narrative": "RoboScape\u2019s core innovation\u2014jointly learning a video world model with explicit physics knowledge through temporal depth prediction and keypoint dynamics\u2014emerges from three converging threads of prior work. First, action-conditioned video prediction in robotics (Finn et al., 2016) and its use for model-based control (Ebert et al., 2018) established predictive visual models as practical simulators for embodied agents. RoboScape inherits this unified predictive paradigm but targets a known failure mode: unrealistic behavior in contact-rich scenarios due to weak 3D and physics grounding. Second, self-supervised depth-from-video (Zhou et al., 2017) and its robust refinements (Godard et al., 2019) showed that temporal photometric constraints can recover consistent scene geometry. RoboScape internalizes this insight by adding temporal depth prediction as an auxiliary task, directly regularizing the world model with 3D structure to improve rendering consistency and camera/object motion. Third, object/keypoint-centric dynamics (Jakab et al., 2018) and relational physics modeling (Battaglia et al., 2016) demonstrated that compact object representations with interaction reasoning capture physical behavior better than pixel-level dynamics alone. RoboScape operationalizes this by learning keypoint dynamics to encode shape/material properties implicitly and to model inter-object contacts. Complementing these, physics-informed video prediction (PhyDNet, 2020) motivates integrating explicit physics priors into learned predictors. Synthesizing these ideas, RoboScape couples geometry-aware supervision with object-centric dynamics inside a single embodied world model, yielding visually faithful and physically plausible robotic video generation under challenging, contact-rich manipulation.",
