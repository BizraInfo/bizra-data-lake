  "synthesis_narrative": "MAETok sits at the intersection of latent diffusion and masked image modeling, rethinking the tokenizer as the critical bottleneck for efficiency and fidelity. Latent Diffusion Models (Rombach et al.) established the practice of running diffusion in a compressed latent space using a KL-regularized autoencoder, coupling speed with high-quality synthesis. However, their variational prior can blur semantic structure in latents. Masked Autoencoders (He et al.) demonstrated that reconstructive masked modeling yields highly discriminative and semantically organized features. MAETok fuses these insights by embedding MAE-style masking into the tokenizer itself, explicitly shaping the latent distribution toward fewer effective modes and stronger separability\u2014properties the paper argues are beneficial for diffusion.\n\nScalable Transformer-based diffusion (DiT; Peebles & Xie) further sharpened the objective: the number and quality of tokens govern compute and performance. By producing semantically rich tokens, MAETok enables state-of-the-art ImageNet generation with only 128 tokens, improving both throughput and gFID. Prior discrete tokenizers like VQGAN and VQ-VAE-2 clarified the power and pitfalls of codebook-based semantics (e.g., quantization artifacts), motivating MAETok\u2019s continuous latent approach with masking to retain fidelity while enhancing structure. Underpinning the generative procedure, DDPM provides the diffusion backbone, while GLO offers conceptual evidence that strong generation need not rely on variational objectives. Together, these works directly shape MAETok\u2019s design choice: a non-variational, masked autoencoding tokenizer that delivers better-structured latents for more efficient and higher-quality diffusion.",
