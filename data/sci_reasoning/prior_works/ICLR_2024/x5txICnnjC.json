  "synthesis_narrative": "Mirror descent, as formalized by Beck and Teboulle, frames optimization updates as steepest descent with respect to a chosen Bregman divergence, making the geometry of parameter space an explicit modeling choice. Kivinen and Warmuth\u2019s exponentiated gradient instantiates this idea with a KL-based mirror map that yields multiplicative updates, demonstrating how non-Euclidean geometry changes the qualitative behavior of learning dynamics. Amari\u2019s natural gradient further elevates geometry to a first-class object by placing learning on a Riemannian manifold, establishing that non-Euclidean metrics can be the principled, invariant way to describe parameter updates. On the empirical side, Loewenstein and colleagues showed that synaptic spine sizes follow multiplicative dynamics that generate log-normal distributions, while Buzs\u00e1ki and Mizuseki documented the prevalence and functional importance of heavy-tailed, log-normal-like distributions across neural systems, including synaptic strengths. In contrast, Lillicrap and co-authors surveyed biologically plausible learning rules as approximations to gradient descent that largely inherit an implicit Euclidean geometry assumption. Together, these works reveal a gap: empirical synaptic statistics suggest multiplicative, non-Euclidean dynamics, while much theory assumes Euclidean updates. The synthesis naturally asks how the choice of geometry determines long-run synaptic statistics. By importing mirror descent\u2019s Bregman geometry and the exponentiated-gradient intuition into synaptic plasticity, the paper shows that non-Euclidean geometries predict log-normal weight distributions and proposes experimental tests for synaptic geometry, directly aligning theory with observed synaptic statistics.",

    "abstract": "A growing literature in computational neuroscience leverages gradient descent and learning algorithms that approximate it to study synaptic plasticity in the brain. However, the vast majority of this work ignores a critical underlying assumption: the choice of distance for synaptic changes - i.e. the geometry of synaptic plasticity. Gradient descent assumes that the distance is Euclidean, but many other distances are possible, and there is no reason that biology necessarily uses Euclidean geometry. Here, using the theoretical tools provided by mirror descent, we show that the distribution of synaptic weights will depend on the geometry of synaptic plasticity. We use these results to show that experimentally-observed log-normal weight distributions found in several brain areas are not consistent with standard gradient descent (i.e. a Euclidean geometry), but rather with non-Euclidean distances. Finally, we show that it should be possible to experimentally test for different synaptic geo",
