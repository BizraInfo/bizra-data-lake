  "synthesis_narrative": "OFA\u2019s core idea\u2014treating the LLM forward pass as a sequence of preconditioned gradient steps and leveraging this view to enable few-shot adaptation without extra parameters\u2014sits at the intersection of three lines of work. First, few-shot adaptation baselines and their limits: Brown et al. (2020) established in-context learning for LLMs but at high inference-time cost, while adapter-based PEFT (Houlsby et al., 2019) and LoRA (Hu et al., 2022) reduced training cost yet can overfit in ultra-low-data settings and still add parameters. These motivate an approach that is both efficient and explicitly regularized by optimization structure.\nSecond, optimization-as-network computation: LISTA (Gregor & LeCun, 2010) showed that networks can be viewed as unrolled, preconditioned iterative solvers, providing a precise template for interpreting layers as gradient-like updates on latent codes. OFA extends this unrolling lens from sparse coding to transformer representations, casting attention/FFN transformations as preconditioned descent steps refining internal states.\nThird, meta-learning and learned optimization: Andrychowicz et al. (2016) and Meta-SGD (Li et al., 2017) demonstrated that learning optimizers and per-parameter step sizes (preconditioners) yields rapid few-shot adaptation. OFA internalizes this insight by learning effective preconditioning within the forward dynamics, but crucially does so without introducing additional trainable parameters, mitigating overfitting and preserving deployment efficiency. Finally, the mechanistic link that transformers can implement gradient descent in-context (von Oswald et al., 2022) grounds OFA\u2019s reinterpretation, unifying ICL phenomena with an explicit, optimization-inspired parameterization and objective that improve adaptation efficiency in the true few-shot regime.",
