  "synthesis_narrative": "MRGC\u2019s core contribution\u2014robust graph condensation through classification complexity mitigation grounded in a manifold view\u2014rests on three converging threads. First, modern dataset condensation demonstrates that small, synthesized datasets can stand in for full corpora when gradients or training dynamics are matched. Gradient-based condensation (Zhao & Bilen, 2021) and trajectory-matching distillation (Cazenavette et al., 2022) establish the mechanisms MRGC inherits to produce informative synthetic graphs, while motivating the need to preserve key learning dynamics. Second, the graph robustness literature reveals why na\u00efvely condensed graphs falter under corruption: Nettack (Z\u00fcgner et al., 2018) and Metattack (Z\u00fcgner & G\u00fcnnemann, 2019) expose both test-time and poisoning vulnerabilities of GNNs, and show standard defenses provide limited protection in challenging threat models. MRGC directly targets this gap by embedding robustness into the condensation process rather than relying solely on downstream defenses. Third, MRGC\u2019s theoretical lens\u2014condensation as intrinsic-dimension reduction that lowers classification complexity\u2014draws on the connection between intrinsic dimensionality and adversarial susceptibility (Ma et al., 2018). To counteract the resultant fragility, MRGC invokes manifold-based learning principles: classic manifold regularization (Belkin et al., 2006) justifies constraining synthesized graphs to lie on the data manifold, and manifold mixup (Verma et al., 2019) exemplifies geometry-aware regularization that smooths decision boundaries. Together, these works directly inform MRGC\u2019s design: a geometry-constrained condensation objective that preserves task-relevant dynamics while explicitly mitigating the robustness risks induced by reduced classification complexity.",
