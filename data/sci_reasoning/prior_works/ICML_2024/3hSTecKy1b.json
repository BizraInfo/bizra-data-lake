  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s central contribution\u2014a roadmap toward universal, machine-verifiable data provenance and consent infrastructure for foundation models\u2014builds on, and synthesizes, three strands of prior work. First, transparency artifacts such as Datasheets for Datasets and Data Statements established the norm of structured documentation of dataset origins, composition, and limitations. Their impact was to set expectations for disclosure; their limitation, which this paper squarely addresses, is that static documentation is neither machine-actionable nor enforceable across sprawling data supply chains. Second, formal provenance models and authenticity tooling offer technical foundations. W3C PROV provides a standardized way to represent lineage, while C2PA shows how cryptographically signed, interoperable content credentials can operate at internet scale for media authenticity. The position paper extends this logic upstream to training data, arguing for signatures, consent, and licensing metadata to travel with data through collection, curation, training, and redistribution. Third, empirical audits and consent mechanisms exposed the gap between ideals and practice. The Data Provenance Initiative quantified licensing opacity in major training corpora, while the IPTC TDM Reservation Protocol provides a concrete, machine-readable opt-out under EU law. Meanwhile, defensive techniques like Glaze underscore the inadequacy of ad hoc, reactive protections for creators. Integrating insights from these works, the paper advances a cohesive vision: adopt interoperable provenance graphs and cryptographic credentials, embed standardized consent/licensing signals, and align technical infrastructure with legal and policy frameworks to make responsible foundation-model development practically achievable.",
