  "synthesis_narrative": "Score-based generative modeling through SDEs established the reverse-time SDE as the core sampling object and showed how its path measure relates to data via KL divergences computable through Girsanov, setting a precise mathematical stage for complexity analyses. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models introduced the discrete-time reverse diffusion (Euler\u2013Maruyama) procedure, making discretization error the pivotal term linking step count to accuracy. Diffusion Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge work developed precise Girsanov-based KL decompositions between forward and reverse diffusion path measures, providing a reusable calculus for bounding distributional mismatch from drift errors along the trajectory. Eldan\u2019s stochastic localization introduced progressive localization to control moments of high-dimensional measures, a technique that yields sharp, local variance control without strong smoothness assumptions. Stochastic Interpolants unified diffusion, flow, and control perspectives and expressed pathwise KL in terms of drift mismatches, reinforcing the use of path-measure tools for nonasymptotic bounds. Prior convergence analyses for score-based diffusion via Girsanov delivered polynomial-time guarantees but incurred superlinear dependence on dimension or required Lipschitz/LSI conditions. Together, these works revealed that (i) reverse-SDE discretization error can be expressed via pathwise KL/Girsanov and (ii) sharper bounds demand local, moment-based control rather than global smoothness. The present paper synthesizes these insights: it extends the Girsanov error decomposition used in earlier convergence proofs, but replaces global smoothness control with a stochastic-localization-inspired analysis that bounds discretization error using only finite second moments, yielding the first nearly linear-in-d step complexity (up to logs).",

    "abstract": "Denoising diffusions are a powerful method to generate approximate samples from high-dimensional data distributions. Recent results provide polynomial bounds on their convergence rate, assuming $L^2$-accurate scores. Until now, the tightest bounds were either superlinear in the data dimension or required strong smoothness assumptions. We provide the first convergence bounds which are linear in the data dimension (up to logarithmic factors) assuming only finite second moments of the data distribution. We show that diffusion models require at most $\\tilde O(\\frac{d \\log^2(1/\\delta)}{\\varepsilon^2})$ steps to approximate an arbitrary distribution on $\\mathbb{R}^d$ corrupted with Gaussian noise of variance $\\delta$ to within $\\varepsilon^2$ in KL divergence. Our proof extends the Girsanov-based methods of previous works. We introduce a refined treatment of the error from discretizing the reverse SDE inspired by stochastic localization.",
