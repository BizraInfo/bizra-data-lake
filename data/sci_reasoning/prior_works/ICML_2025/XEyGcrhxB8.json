  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution is a unified theory that casts offline alignment\u2014spanning RLHF and DPO\u2014into a single parameter-estimation problem in logistic regression under linear modeling. Three lines of prior work directly underpin this reduction and the ensuing privacy\u2013robustness analysis. First, RLHF and its modern instantiation in instruction tuning supply the problem setting and objective structure: Christiano et al. formalized preference-based learning from pairwise human comparisons, while Ouyang et al. popularized the KL-regularized RLHF pipeline that motivates analyzing offline alignment under noisy preference labels. Second, DPO explicitly recasts preference optimization as a logistic loss over pairwise comparisons relative to a reference model, making the connection to logistic regression concrete. This connection ultimately rests on the Bradley\u2013Terry model, which provides the logistic link between linear scores and pairwise choice probabilities, enabling the paper\u2019s reduction from alignment to logistic parameter estimation.\nThird, the paper\u2019s privacy\u2013robustness interplay draws from foundational theory in local differential privacy and robust statistics. Duchi\u2013Jordan\u2013Wainwright\u2019s minimax analysis of the local model characterizes how local randomization contracts information, a key ingredient in proving the separation between corruption-then-privacy (CTL) and privacy-then-corruption (LTC). Huber\u2019s \u03b5-contamination model formalizes adversarial label corruption, while results on learning with noisy labels (Natarajan et al.) clarify how label flips bias logistic objectives and guide robust error bounds. Together, these works make possible the paper\u2019s unified treatment and its main insight: LTC is intrinsically harder than CTL for offline alignment under linear-logistic reductions.",
