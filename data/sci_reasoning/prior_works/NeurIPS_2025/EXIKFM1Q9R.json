  "synthesis_narrative": "Abstract Rendering unifies certified perception with physically grounded 3D-to-2D image formation by propagating uncertainty through the rendering pipeline into neural networks. This synthesis rests on abstract interpretation and linear-relaxation bound propagation pioneered by AI2 and CROWN/DeepPoly: these works establish how to represent sets of inputs with tractable abstract domains and push tight, piecewise-linear bounds through complex computation graphs for certification. The paper extends this paradigm beyond pixel-level perturbations to 3D semantic uncertainty by introducing abstractions for rendering-specific operators that standard LiRPA tools do not support.\n\nTwo strands from computer graphics and vision shape the operator choices. NeRF\u2019s volume rendering formalism introduces cumulative transmittance products along rays; bounding these motivates tailored linear envelopes for cumulative product summations, mathematically grounded in McCormick\u2019s convex\u2013concave relaxations for products. Differentiable rasterization, exemplified by the Neural 3D Mesh Renderer, highlights depth-based, sorting-driven aggregation and barycentric interpolation; this spurs the development of sound bounds for sorting/select-and-aggregate behavior within rendering. Finally, camera pose uncertainty requires inverting perturbed transforms; Matrix Perturbation Theory provides the stability analysis and inverse sensitivity needed to design safe abstractions for matrix inversion.\n\nBy marrying abstract-interpretation-style certification with the core primitives of modern rendering, the paper constructs an abstract image\u2014constraints that provably overapproximate all images generated by continuous pose/scene variations\u2014and then composes this with downstream networks. The result is a principled, certifiable pipeline for semantic (3D) perturbations, concretely enabled by the prior foundations in neural verification, differentiable rendering, and convex relaxations.",
