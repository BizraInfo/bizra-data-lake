  "synthesis_narrative": "The core of this paper is a principled characterization and correction of inversion bias for random sampling matrices, with concrete impact on sub-sampled Newton (SSN) methods. The lineage begins with the development of sampling-based sketches for least-squares and subspace embeddings by Drineas et al. (2006), which established leverage-score and related random sampling matrices now ubiquitous in RandNLA and optimization. In second-order optimization, Pilanci and Wainwright\u2019s Newton Sketch (2015) and their broader convex-program sketching framework (2016) made the inverse of sketched Hessians a central computational primitive, creating a direct setting where inversion bias matters. Roosta-Khorasani and Mahoney\u2019s SSN (2016) instantiated these ideas with explicit row-sampled Hessian approximations; the current paper treats SSN as a primary baseline and targets the bias that arises when inverting those sampled Hessians. On the theoretical side, Muirhead\u2019s classic multivariate statistics results provide the exact inverse-Wishart expectation, explaining why Gaussian projections admit a simple scalar debiasing\u2014an important special case that motivates searching for analogous corrections beyond Gaussian sketches. Most recently, Liao et al. (2024) showed how to correct inversion bias for sparse sub-Gaussian projection sketches; this identified the phenomenon and supplied a modern debiasing blueprint. The present paper directly extends that blueprint to the structurally different class of random sampling matrices, filling a key gap for methods like SSN that rely on sampling rather than projection.",
