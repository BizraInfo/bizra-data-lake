  "synthesis_narrative": "Pair-Align\u2019s core insight is to decompose graph domain shift into conditional structure shift and label shift, then correct them with two targeted mechanisms: edge-level reweighting and label-weighted losses. The label-shift arm stands squarely on classical and modern target-shift correction: Saerens et al. introduced the principled reweighting of class losses by target priors, while Lipton et al. provided robust, black-box procedures to estimate those priors\u2014ideas Pair-Align adopts to adjust the classification loss on graphs. The structure arm reframes domain alignment from nodes to relations. Importance weighting (Huang et al.) motivates reweighting to correct mismatched distributions; Pair-Align pushes this to the pairwise level by reweighting edges to undo conditional structure shift. Optimal Transport for domain adaptation (Courty et al.) further inspires relation-aware matching via pairwise couplings, reinforcing the need to align structural relations rather than only marginal features. Empirically and conceptually, Pair-Align is positioned against GDA baselines such as UDAGCN that align node embeddings but neglect explicit structural mismatch; it improves by directly recalibrating neighbor influence. Finally, evidence that GNNs degrade under heterophily/structural discrepancy (e.g., Geom-GCN) crystallizes the gap Pair-Align addresses. Relatedly, associative alignment works (H\u00e4usser et al.) validate the shift to pairwise alignment that Pair-Align adapts to graph edges with theoretical grounding.",
