  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation\u2014a neuro-symbolic framework that marries code-as-policies with explicit symbolic verification and interactive validation\u2014emerges by unifying three lines of prior work. First, Code as Policies established the template of treating LLM outputs as executable robot policies, but its failures under dynamics and partial observability motivated stronger grounding. Second, methods that intertwine reasoning and acting, notably ReAct and Voyager, showed that agents can actively probe their environments and refine behavior via execution feedback; however, they lacked formal guarantees or state-preserving constraints. Third, grounding and formalism from classical and neurosymbolic planning\u2014exemplified by SayCan\u2019s external affordance gating and PDDLStream\u2019s precondition/effect-based feasibility checks\u2014demonstrated how symbolic structure can vet decisions before they are executed. Program-centric reasoning work like PAL (and, in vision, ViperGPT) further proved that executing generated code can improve reliability by turning abstract plans into concrete, verifiable procedures.\n\nSynthesizing these threads, the paper adopts CaP\u2019s executable-program substrate but inserts a PDDL/TAMP-inspired symbolic verifier that checks preconditions, effects, and invariants of generated code. It operationalizes ReAct-style interaction as a dedicated validation phase that produces exploratory code to acquire the missing observations needed to satisfy symbolic checks, while preserving task-relevant state. By closing this loop\u2014generate, symbolically verify, actively validate, and then commit\u2014the framework directly addresses the brittleness and grounding gaps identified in Voyager-like agents and CaP, yielding more reliable task execution in dynamic, partially observable environments.",
