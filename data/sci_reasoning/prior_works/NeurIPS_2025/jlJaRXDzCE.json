  "synthesis_narrative": "Comba\u2019s core idea is to reframe recently popular fast\u2011weight, delta\u2011rule\u2013supervised recurrent models as Bilinear RNNs and then improve them with closed\u2011loop control: state and output feedback applied to a scalar\u2011plus\u2011low\u2011rank transition. The immediate precursors are the new bilinear fast\u2011weight systems\u2014most notably Gated DeltaNet and RWKV\u2014whose state updates depend multiplicatively on the current key/state, yielding strong efficiency but leaving memory dynamics effectively open\u2011loop. Building on the state\u2011space formalism inaugurated by S4 and the selective SSM evolution in Mamba, the authors identify a specific gap: linear SSMs (even with selection) do not realize explicit state\u2013key bilinear coupling, and existing bilinear fast\u2011weight models lack principled feedback for stability and controllability. The theoretical underpinning comes from fast\u2011weight/linear\u2011attention connections (Schlag et al.), which justify seeing these models as delta\u2011rule memories, and from classical control (Kalman), which prescribes output\u2011feedback corrections to close the loop. This synthesis leads directly to Comba\u2019s architectural choices: (1) keep the bilinear fast\u2011weight mechanism; (2) introduce state- and output\u2011feedback corrections to the recurrence; and (3) parameterize the transition as scalar\u2011plus\u2011low\u2011rank for capacity/efficiency balance. Finally, linear\u2011time attention work (Katharopoulos et al.) informs the chunk\u2011wise parallel kernel design that makes the closed\u2011loop bilinear recurrence hardware\u2011efficient. Without these prior lines\u2014fast\u2011weight bilinear updates, SSM framing, and closed\u2011loop control\u2014the paper\u2019s key innovation would not cohere.",
