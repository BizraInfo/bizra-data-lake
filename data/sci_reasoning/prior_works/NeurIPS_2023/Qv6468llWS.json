  "synthesis_narrative": "PDE-Refiner\u2019s core insight is that neural PDE solvers lose non-dominant, often high-frequency, spatial information during long rollouts, driving instability and drift. This diagnosis is grounded in spectral-bias theory from Rahaman et al., which established that standard neural networks preferentially fit low frequencies, and reinforced by physics-specific analyses such as Wang et al.\u2019s frequency perspective on PINNs. Concurrently, the neural simulator literature, exemplified by mesh-based graph networks from Pfaff et al., highlighted exposure bias and compounding rollout errors in learned dynamics, framing the stability problem PDE-Refiner targets.\n\nOn the solution side, operator-learning methods like the Fourier Neural Operator (Li et al.) provided strong neural surrogates and a spectral lens but still underrepresented high-frequency modes over time. PDE-Refiner\u2019s architectural leap\u2014multistep refinement\u2014draws directly from diffusion and score-based generative modeling. DDPM (Ho et al.) supplies the iterative denoising template and noise-level conditioning, while score-based SDE modeling (Song et al.) contributes the notion of continuous schedules and predictor\u2013corrector stepping to traverse scales. SR3\u2019s success in reconstructing high-frequency image details via repeated refinement offers a concrete precedent for using diffusion-inspired procedures to recover lost fine-scale structure.\n\nBy uniting these strands\u2014spectral diagnostics from theory and physics ML, operator-learning foundations, and diffusion-driven iterative refinement\u2014PDE-Refiner formulates a conditional, multistep corrector that restores high-frequency content during rollout, yielding stable, accurate long-horizon PDE predictions.",
