  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution is to disentangle multi-agent debate (MAD) into two components\u2014majority voting and inter-agent debate\u2014and show theoretically and empirically that voting accounts for most observed gains while pure debate, modeled as an unbiased stochastic process, does not improve expected correctness. Irving, Christiano, and Amodei\u2019s AI Safety via Debate provided the foundational multi-agent debate setup that this work scrutinizes, enabling a clean decomposition of the mechanism. The empirical backbone comes from self-consistency (Wang et al.), which demonstrated that aggregating diverse chains of thought via majority voting is a powerful baseline; this directly motivates the paper\u2019s finding that voting alone yields most of the performance typically credited to MAD. Chain-of-Thought prompting (Wei et al.) is the enabling technique that allows sampling multiple explicit reasoning trajectories across agents, making both voting and debate analyses tractable. Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al.) further contextualizes the result by showing that performance gains often stem from exploration-plus-selection across reasoning paths, aligning with the claim that aggregation dominates over inter-agent information exchange. On the theory side, the martingale characterization of beliefs in Blackwell and Dubins underpins the paper\u2019s result that unbiased debate induces a belief martingale, implying no expected improvement absent bias. Finally, intervention-based methods like Self-Refine (Madaan et al.) motivate the paper\u2019s constructive step: introduce targeted biases (e.g., critique, verification) to tilt updates toward correction, thereby converting neutral debate into a meaningfully effective process.",
