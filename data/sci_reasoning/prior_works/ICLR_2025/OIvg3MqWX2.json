  "synthesis_narrative": "Radius-based neighbor graphs became the default for molecular GNNs with SchNet, which operationalized continuous filters over local environments defined by a fixed cutoff but offered no guarantees that such graphs remain both sparse and connected. DimeNet demonstrated that encoding directional geometry via distances and angles markedly improves accuracy, yet its underlying cutoff graphs remain non-rigid, leaving spatial arrangements underconstrained by the graph structure itself. EGNN further showed that equivariance leverages geometric signals effectively, while still depending on heuristically constructed neighborhood graphs for scalability. In parallel, classical rigidity theory established how sparsity and rigidity can coexist: Laman gave tight edge-count conditions for minimal rigidity, Hendrickson characterized when edge-length\u2013constrained frameworks are uniquely realizable, and pebble-game algorithms by Lee and Streinu provided practical tools to certify and extract sparse rigid subgraphs. From computational geometry, Voronoi/Delaunay proximity constructions showed how to obtain hyperparameter-free, geometry-driven adjacencies that are connected and typically sparse. Together, these strands exposed a gap: modern molecular GNNs benefit from geometric features but rest on graphs that lack provable connectivity, sparsity, and rigidity. The natural next step is to synthesize proximity-based, hyperparameter-free neighbor selection with rigidity-theoretic guarantees, yielding a graph whose edge set remains bounded while ensuring connectivity and generic rigidity so that edge distances and dihedral angles suffice to uniquely determine 3D structure\u2014thereby providing a theoretically grounded substrate for equivariant and directional message passing.",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) -- learn graph representations by exploiting the graph's sparsity, connectivity, and symmetries -- have become indispensable for learning geometric data like molecules. However, the most used graphs (e.g., radial cutoff graphs) in molecular modeling lack theoretical guarantees for achieving connectivity and sparsity simultaneously, which are essential for the performance and scalability of GNNs. Furthermore, existing widely used graph construction methods for molecules lack rigidity, limiting GNNs' ability to exploit graph nodes' spatial arrangement. In this paper, we introduce a new hyperparameter-free graph construction of molecules and beyond with sparsity, connectivity, and rigidity guarantees. Remarkably, our method consistently generates connected and sparse graphs with the edge-to-node ratio being bounded above by 3. Our graphs' rigidity guarantees that edge distances and dihedral angles are sufficient to uniquely determine the general spatial arrang",
