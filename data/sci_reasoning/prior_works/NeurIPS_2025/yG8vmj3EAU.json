  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014a tractable, expressive variational family formed by weighted products of Student\u2011t experts and made samplable via an auxiliary Dirichlet representation\u2014sits at the intersection of classic modeling, quantum-field-theory identities, and modern stochastic variational optimization. Hinton\u2019s Products of Experts introduced the core modeling idea of multiplicatively combining simple experts to capture complex structure, while Tresp\u2019s Bayesian Committee Machine established that weighted PoE constructions can remain tractable and useful for posterior combination. To make such a PoE viable for black-box variational inference, the authors rely on the BBVI framework of Ranganath et al., which supplies stochastic gradient estimators and optimization machinery.\nCrucially, the paper unlocks sampling from a product of t-experts by invoking the Feynman parameterization: a transformation that rewrites a product of fractional terms as an integral over the probability simplex. This yields a latent-variable model with Dirichlet auxiliary weights. The choice of Student\u2011t experts is informed by the scale-mixture perspective of Andrews and Mallows, reflecting a tradition of using auxiliary variables to render heavy-tailed models tractable. Once the Dirichlet augmentation is in place, efficient optimization hinges on gradients through simplex variables; pathwise techniques for Gamma/Dirichlet distributions from Jankowiak and Obermeyer provide exactly that. Finally, \u2018score-based\u2019 gradient computation aligns with Fisher\u2019s identity (as formalized by Louis), moving derivatives inside expectations over the newly introduced latents. Together, these works enable a PoE variational family that is both expressive (skew, tails, multi-modality) and operationally tractable for BBVI.",
