  "synthesis_narrative": "PhoCoLens builds on two converging lines of work: lensless computational imaging and generative priors for inverse problems. Foundational lensless systems like FlatCam established coded-mask sensing and multiplexed linear forward models, while DiffuserCam demonstrated practical calibration for strongly space-variant PSFs, exposing the fidelity challenges that arise from forward-model mismatches across the field of view. Classic space-variant deblurring, exemplified by Efficient Filter Flow, provides the algorithmic blueprint for PhoCoLens\u2019s first stage: a spatially varying deconvolution that emphasizes accurate, data-consistent recovery of low-frequency structure across the image plane.\n\nConcurrently, Plug-and-Play Priors introduced the paradigm of injecting powerful learned priors into iterative reconstruction while preserving measurement consistency. Recent diffusion-based approaches, DDRM and DPS, refined this idea by using pretrained diffusion models to sample solutions that remain consistent with the measurement operator, clarifying how to marry generative modeling with data fidelity. Finally, SR3 demonstrated the effectiveness of conditioning diffusion models on low-resolution (i.e., low-frequency) guidance to generate photorealistic high-frequency details.\n\nPhoCoLens synthesizes these threads: it first secures a trustworthy, spatially consistent low-frequency estimate via space-variant deconvolution tailored to lensless PSFs, then leverages a measurement-conditioned diffusion prior\u2014akin to DDRM/DPS and SR3\u2019s conditional formulation\u2014to add realistic high-frequency content without violating data consistency. This staged design directly addresses the twin bottlenecks of lensless imaging\u2014imperfect forward models and weak priors\u2014yielding reconstructions that are both physically consistent and photorealistic.",
