  "synthesis_narrative": "The central lineage of this paper begins with Dasgupta, Frost, Moshkovitz, and Rashtchian (2020), who formulated explainable clustering as optimizing k-medians/k-means under the constraint that assignments are realized by axis-aligned threshold decision trees. They provided structural and algorithmic results for p=1 and p=2, establishing both the interpretability model and the baseline guarantees\u2014O(log k)\u2013type behavior for k-medians and a weaker polylogarithmic bound for k-means\u2014that left open how to handle general \u2113_p and whether the p=2 exponent could be improved. The roots of the interpretability class itself trace to CART (Breiman et al., 1984), which formalized threshold decision trees, and to Bentley\u2019s k-d trees (1975), which introduced axis-aligned recursive partitioning of Euclidean space. Methodologically, recursive geometric partitions with cost control across levels\u2014central to explainable clustering analyses\u2014were influenced by random projection and partition trees (Dasgupta\u2013Freund, 2008). Finally, the multi-scale reasoning that yields logarithmic factors through hierarchical trees connects to Bartal\u2019s tree-metric approximations and the FRT bound, which provided a paradigm for analyzing hierarchical decompositions with logarithmic distortion. Building directly on the explainable-clustering framework and its p=1/p=2 analyses, the present paper generalizes the structural/algorithmic approach to all finite p\u22651 and sharpens the p=2 exponent, yielding an O\u0303(p\u00b7(log k)^{1+1/p\u22121/p^2}) approximation and thereby filling the explicit gap left by prior work.",
