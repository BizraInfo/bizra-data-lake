  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014tuning a spectral method by adding a nonlinear, degree-profile-based diagonal Y + diag(\u03c3(Y1)) to exploit directional priors such as positivity\u2014emerges by fusing two mature threads. First, belief-propagation-inspired spectral operators for sparse graphs established that degree-aware deformations of the adjacency can unlock near-threshold performance. Non-backtracking (Krzakala et al., 2013) and the Bethe Hessian (Saade et al., 2014) explicitly inject degree information via carefully chosen diagonal terms, showing that diagonal corrections derived from local statistics stabilize the spectrum and encode model structure. Regularized spectral clustering (Qin & Rohe, 2013) and concentration theory for regularized graphs (Le\u2013Levina\u2013Vershynin, 2017) further validated degree-based diagonal adjustments as both practical and theoretically sound in sparse, heterogeneous settings.\nSecond, the use of directional prior information\u2014specifically positivity\u2014originates in nonnegative PCA and AMP-style methods (Deshpande & Montanari, 2014) and in the broader BP framework (Decelle et al., 2011), where nonlinear denoisers tailored to priors drive improved estimation of rank-one signals. The present work brings these strands together by replacing fixed, linear diagonal corrections with a tunable nonlinear map \u03c3 that operationalizes the prior through the degree profile, thereby creating a family of \u201cnonlinear Laplacians.\u201d In graph models (e.g., densest subgraph and planted submatrix), this mechanism targets positive-bias signals while retaining the robustness of degree-corrected spectra. Statistical benchmarks from planted submatrix detection (Butucea & Ingster, 2013) provide the natural yardstick for evaluating how this prior-informed spectral deformation compares to classical PCA and direct spectral baselines.",
