  "synthesis_narrative": "Graph DiT\u2019s core advances\u2014multi-conditional molecular graph generation, a Transformer-based graph denoiser, and a graph-dependent noising process\u2014stand on three converging lines of prior work. First, discrete diffusion for categorical variables, formalized by D3PM, made it possible to corrupt and denoise node and edge types via transition matrices. DiGress adapted this to entire graphs, but treated atom and bond corruption independently. Graph DiT directly extends this lineage by introducing a joint, graph-dependent noise model that better reflects molecular incidence constraints, addressing a key shortcoming of independent node/edge noising.\nSecond, Graph DiT\u2019s denoiser design draws from the pivot in diffusion modeling toward Transformers. DiT showed that attention-based denoisers can scale and outperform convolutional U-Nets, while Graphormer demonstrated how to inject graph structure into Transformers via edge- and distance-aware biases. Graph DiT fuses these insights, yielding a Transformer denoiser tailored to molecular graphs.\nThird, conditioning mechanisms from diffusion\u2014particularly classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance\u2014provide the blueprint for controllable generation. Building on these, Graph DiT introduces a condition encoder that jointly represents heterogeneous properties (numerical and categorical), enabling multi-conditional control without external classifiers. Together, these works directly inform Graph DiT\u2019s architectural choices and training objective, culminating in improved validity and property alignment for both polymers and small molecules under multiple concurrent constraints.",
