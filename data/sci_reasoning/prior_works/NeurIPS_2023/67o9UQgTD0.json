  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014defining and operationalizing counterfactual memorization as the change in a language model\u2019s predictions when a specific document is omitted\u2014sits at the intersection of two lines of prior work: memorization in language models and data attribution via influence estimation. Carlini et al. (2019) established the modern vocabulary and metrics for unintended memorization in generative models, revealing how rarity and repetition shape memorization signals. Subsequent extraction results in large LMs (Carlini et al., 2021) showed concrete regurgitation and highlighted duplicated data as a dominant driver, while Kandpal et al. (2022) demonstrated that deduplication substantially reduces privacy risk\u2014together motivating a need to separate duplication-driven \u201ccommon\u201d memorization from data points whose individual presence truly governs model behavior.\n\nTo formalize this separation, the paper leverages influence-based ideas that quantify the counterfactual effect of removing a training point. Koh and Liang (2017) provided the foundational influence function framework for leave-one-out effect estimation, and TracIn (Pruthi et al., 2020) offered a scalable approximation suitable for deep models. Finally, theoretical and empirical insights from Feldman and Zhang (2020) connected memorization to the long tail of atypical, high-influence examples, reinforcing the value of per-example counterfactual analysis. Integrating these strands, the NeurIPS 2023 paper advances the field by identifying counterfactually memorized examples, estimating their influence on validation predictions and generations, and furnishing direct evidence that links generated text back to specific training documents\u2014precisely disentangling frequency-driven copying from genuine, per-example memorization.",
