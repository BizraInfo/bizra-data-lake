  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014characterizing an optimal p-value threshold in a principal\u2013agent setting with strategic data submission\u2014sits at the intersection of statistical decision theory and strategic information provision. Neyman\u2013Pearson (1933) provides the canonical foundation that optimal hypothesis tests are threshold rules, which underlies the paper\u2019s focus on a single scalar cutoff. Building on this, Kamenica and Gentzkow\u2019s Bayesian Persuasion frames the agent\u2019s problem as strategically shaping or selecting evidence to induce a favorable decision, while the principal commits to a decision rule; this sender\u2013receiver perspective directly informs the game-theoretic modeling of participation and reporting. The algorithmic literature on strategic behavior\u2014particularly Strategic Classification and Performative Prediction\u2014supplies methodological tools for anticipating equilibrium responses to threshold policies, clarifying how a chosen cutoff feeds back into agents\u2019 actions and the induced data distribution. Complementing these are models of selection and reporting incentives: Andrews and Kasy formalize selective publication around significance cutoffs, aligning with the paper\u2019s treatment of agent participation conditional on the principal\u2019s test, and Simmons, Nelson, and Simonsohn empirically demonstrate how flexible analysis and optional stopping can be exploited to clear a threshold, motivating the need to design rules robust to strategic behavior. Finally, debates over appropriate alpha levels (Benjamin et al.) provide a normative lens for trading off false positives and negatives; this work advances that discussion by proving monotonic error behavior segmented by a critical p-value and delivering an interpretable, efficiently computable optimal threshold under strategic interaction.",
