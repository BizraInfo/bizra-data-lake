  "synthesis_narrative": "DiffPreT\u2019s key contribution\u2014pretraining a protein encoder by predicting joint sequence\u2013structure diffusion trajectories and extending this with a Siamese conformer objective\u2014sits at the intersection of diffusion modeling, geometric deep learning, and sequence\u2013structure self-supervision. The DDPM framework provides the backbone training objective for learning to reverse a Markov noising process, while D3PM supplies the critical machinery to treat amino-acid residues as discrete variables that can be diffused and denoised in lockstep with continuous coordinates. To make diffusion physically meaningful over 3D structures, DiffPreT draws on equivariant modeling principles exemplified by SE(3)-Transformers, ensuring that perturbations and predictions respect rigid-body symmetries of proteins. Empirical successes of protein-focused diffusion, most notably RFdiffusion, validate diffusion as an effective engine for capturing structural distributions and their coupling to sequence, bolstering the choice to learn a joint distribution rather than modeling sequence or structure alone. From the self-supervised protein literature, inverse folding (Ingraham et al.) established structure-to-sequence recovery as a powerful supervision signal, and GVP-GNN demonstrated how to fuse scalar and geometric features into a unified protein encoder\u2014both design cues directly reflected in DiffPreT\u2019s encoder and objectives. Finally, SiamDiff adapts the Siamese self-supervised template popularized by SimCLR: using multiple conformers of the same protein as coordinated \u2018views,\u2019 it predicts aligned diffusion trajectories to explicitly encode conformational correlations, addressing functional variability that single-structure pretraining misses.",
