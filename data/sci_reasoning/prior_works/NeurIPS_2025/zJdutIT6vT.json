  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s central idea\u2014explaining signed interactions via a small set of opinion intervals on a line\u2014sits at the confluence of signed-network theory, interval graph structure, and disagreement-minimization frameworks. Structural balance (Cartwright\u2013Harary) provides the conceptual foundation: signed ties should be consistent with an underlying latent arrangement. Empirical and modeling work on signed social media (Leskovec\u2013Huttenlocher\u2013Kleinberg) sharpened this notion by demonstrating that real signed networks reflect low-dimensional latent structure (balance/status) and by framing objectives in terms of minimizing sign disagreements.\n\nThe optimization backbone comes from correlation clustering (Bansal\u2013Blum\u2013Chawla), whose disagreement objective the paper adapts to an interval-structured latent space; approximation algorithms and hardness bounds from Charikar\u2013Guruswami\u2013Wirth ground the complexity landscape and influence heuristic design. Moreover, PTAS techniques for structured variants (Giotis\u2013Guruswami) provide a template for achieving a polynomial-time approximation scheme once the problem is restricted by interval structure.\n\nOn the geometric side, interval graph theory and algorithms (Booth\u2013Lueker) supply the representational and algorithmic primitives that connect overlapping opinion ranges to positive edges, enabling reductions and dynamic-program-style schemes critical to the PTAS. Finally, scalable signed-graph methods (Kunegis\u2013Schmidt\u2013Lommatzsch) motivate and inform the paper\u2019s practical heuristics for large networks. Together, these works directly inform the modeling, hardness proofs, approximation strategy, and scalable algorithms that constitute the paper\u2019s key contribution.",
