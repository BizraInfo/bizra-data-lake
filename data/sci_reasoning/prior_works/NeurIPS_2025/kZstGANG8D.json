  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core move\u2014abandoning the Bradley\u2013Terry (BT) assumption and casting preference alignment as a two-player game solved by optimistic mirror descent\u2014sits at the intersection of RLHF practice and online learning in games. Christiano et al. (2017) and Ouyang et al. (2022) established the now-standard RLHF pipeline that models pairwise feedback with a BT-style latent reward and optimizes a policy against it; these systems function as both the foundational setup and the practical baselines the paper aims to supersede. Rafailov et al. (2023) further codified BT-based alignment via DPO, whose reliance on the logistic choice model exposes the precise limitation\u2014BT\u2019s restrictiveness and inability to capture general, possibly intransitive, preferences\u2014that this work targets. By explicitly departing from the BT framework (Bradley & Terry, 1952), the authors re-formulate alignment as a convex\u2013concave preference game and import tools from learning in games to obtain sharper guarantees. Rakhlin & Sridharan (2013) provide the optimistic mirror descent framework and the principle that predictability/optimism improves rates, while Syrgkanis et al. (2015) show that optimistic no-regret dynamics in games can reach O(1/T) convergence to Nash\u2014precisely the rate improvement claimed over standard O(1/\u221aT) dynamics. Finally, Daskalakis et al. (2018) demonstrate that optimistic gradient/mirror methods yield last-iterate convergence in saddle-point problems; this result is extended to the LLM preference game here, underpinning the paper\u2019s linear last-iterate convergence guarantee.",
