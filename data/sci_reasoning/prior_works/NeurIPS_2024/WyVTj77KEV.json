  "synthesis_narrative": "PocketFlow\u2019s core innovation is to generate protein pockets conditioned on ligands while explicitly embedding protein\u2013ligand interaction priors and using multi-granularity guidance during sampling. This builds on the diffusion/flow generative paradigm introduced by DDPM, which framed generation as integrating a learned vector field or denoising process. Dhariwal and Nichol\u2019s guidance principle directly motivates PocketFlow\u2019s sampling-time control: an external objective steers generation. PocketFlow instantiates this with two complementary signals\u2014a global affinity score to push towards high-binding pockets and local geometry constraints to enforce correct hydrogen-bond and contact motifs.\n\nAccurate 3D modeling is enabled by equivariant representations. EGNN provides the backbone for learning on atomic coordinates without violating Euclidean symmetries, while Equivariant Diffusion for Molecule Generation demonstrates how to model and denoise 3D point clouds/atoms, informing PocketFlow\u2019s coordinate parameterization and loss design. On the application side, DiffDock shows that diffusion-style generative modeling of protein\u2013ligand complexes can be binding-aware and benefit from guidance, which PocketFlow extends from pose generation to pocket synthesis.\n\nFinally, decades of physics- and template-based pocket design (e.g., AutoDock Vina scoring; Tinberg et al.\u2019s geometry-constrained Rosetta designs) crystallized the critical role of hydrogen-bonding and interaction geometry. PocketFlow absorbs this domain knowledge as learnable priors and guidance, achieving the speed of deep generative models while preserving the chemical validity traditionally ensured by structure-based design.",
