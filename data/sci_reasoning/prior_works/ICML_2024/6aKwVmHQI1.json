  "synthesis_narrative": "ViP\u2019s central innovation\u2014scalable self\u2011supervised pretraining of a vision foundation model with rigorous differential privacy\u2014rests on two pillars: the DP mechanism and a DP\u2011compatible SSL objective. The privacy mechanism comes directly from DP\u2011SGD (Abadi et al.), with R\u00e9nyi DP accounting (Mironov) enabling tight composition over long training schedules to credibly report \u03b5\u22488. Architecturally, ViP builds on Vision Transformers (Dosovitskiy et al.), whose patch tokenization and transformer backbone are the default substrate for modern self\u2011supervised vision methods.\nThe key algorithmic choice is to adopt masked autoencoding (He et al., MAE). ViP argues and demonstrates that MAE\u2019s dense reconstruction loss aligns with per\u2011example clipping and injected noise, preserving learning signals under DP\u2011SGD. This selection is a direct response to the limitations of contrastive SSL such as SimCLR (Chen et al.), where large-batch, pairwise objectives suffer disproportionately under clipping and noise, and to fragilities observed in teacher\u2013student self-distillation like DINO (Caron et al.) when gradients are perturbed. Finally, the motivation for imposing formal privacy at internet scale is grounded in concrete leakage evidence from foundation models (Carlini et al.), which ViP addresses by making the entire pretraining private rather than relying solely on private fine\u2011tuning. Together, these works provided the privacy machinery, the architectural substrate, the motivating risks, and the specific self\u2011supervised strategy that ViP extends to the private foundation\u2011model regime.",
