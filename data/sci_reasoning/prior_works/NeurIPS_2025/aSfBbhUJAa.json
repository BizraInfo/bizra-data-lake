  "synthesis_narrative": "RepoMaster\u2019s core contribution is an autonomous agent that can explore, understand, and reuse third-party GitHub repositories to solve complex tasks despite overwhelming code volume, tangled dependencies, and limited LLM context. This advances the SWE-agent and OpenHands lines of work, which established agentic interfaces and workflows for real-world software tasks but remained constrained by coarse repository grounding (often issue/README centric) and weak strategies for disentangling inter-module dependencies. The problem framing and evaluation urgency came from SWE-bench, which made clear that success on real GitHub issues requires repository-scale reasoning rather than file-level prompting.\nMethodologically, RepoMaster draws on ReAct\u2019s interleaving of reasoning and acting to structure iterative planning, repository probing (filesystem navigation, builds, tests), and reflection. To overcome context limits, it applies Retrieval-Augmented Generation principles, retrieving and summarizing only the dependency-critical slices of a repository instead of dumping entire codebases into prompts. Its focus on constructing and traversing repository dependency and call graphs is motivated by evidence from GraphCodeBERT that structural program representations materially improve code understanding. Finally, the agent\u2019s autonomous, iterative exploration and reuse of components are inspired by Voyager\u2019s skill acquisition loop, repurposed here to acquire and chain repository modules as reusable capabilities. Together, these threads yield a framework that moves beyond README-driven heuristics by systematically mapping, retrieving, and operationalizing the minimum working subset of a repository needed to accomplish complex tasks.",
