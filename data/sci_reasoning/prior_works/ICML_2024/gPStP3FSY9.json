  "synthesis_narrative": "Cross-Risk Minimization (XRM) tackles the central obstacle in invariant and group-robust learning: discovering useful environments without human annotations or validation-time early-stopping. This goal is conceptually anchored in invariant causal prediction and Invariant Risk Minimization, which framed environments as the vehicle for enforcing invariance across shifts, yet operationally depend on known environment labels. Group DRO further highlighted the practical benefits of group-aware learning but also made explicit the need for group labels to control worst-case risk.\nDirectly addressing the label-free setting, EIIL introduced environment inference from model behavior, and JTT leveraged a model\u2019s errors to emphasize vulnerable subpopulations. XRM is a response to the core limitations of these error-based approaches\u2014sensitivity to hyperparameters and reliance on early stopping tuned with group labels. The key advance in XRM is a twin-network training scheme on random data halves, where each network imitates the other\u2019s confident held-out mistakes. This cross-risk imitation stabilizes environment discovery, reduces confirmation bias, and yields a principled recipe for hyperparameter selection without group-labeled validation.\nMethodologically, XRM\u2019s twin-network design is inspired by co-teaching\u2019s cross-supervision under noise, while its focus on exploiting failure patterns echoes LfF\u2019s use of biased-model errors to reveal spurious correlations. By synthesizing these lines\u2014environmental invariance, error-based environment inference, and twin-network cross-learning\u2014XRM delivers robust, annotation-free environment discovery that can be directly plugged into invariance or group-robust objectives.",
