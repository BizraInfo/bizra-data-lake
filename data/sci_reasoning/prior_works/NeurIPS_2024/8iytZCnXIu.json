  "synthesis_narrative": "BricksRL\u2019s key contribution\u2014bringing practical, end-to-end reinforcement learning to affordable, modular LEGO robots\u2014rests on a convergence of algorithmic, interface, and platform precedents. TorchRL (Moens et al.) supplies the core training substrate: a modular agent stack, batched data collection, and GPU-accelerated learners that BricksRL binds to LEGO hubs via a bidirectional Bluetooth interface. OpenAI Gym\u2019s standardized agent\u2013environment API shapes BricksRL\u2019s environment abstractions, allowing users to plug LEGO builds into the familiar RL tooling ecosystem.\n\nTo make on-hardware learning fast and reliable on commodity laptops, BricksRL depends on modern, sample-efficient algorithms. Soft Actor-Critic offers stability and high data efficiency for continuous control, while PPO provides a robust on-policy alternative\u2014both available out of the box through TorchRL. These choices are critical for achieving sub-120-minute training on real robots without expensive infrastructure.\n\nConceptually and socially, BricksRL follows the democratization path laid out by Duckietown: open designs, low-cost components, and educational accessibility at scale. Finally, BricksRL\u2019s engineering decisions answer the constraints articulated in real-world RL surveys (Dulac-Arnold et al.), emphasizing safe, reliable data collection, robust hardware\u2013software interfacing, and practical training times. Together, these works directly inform BricksRL\u2019s architecture and methodology, enabling a scalable, cost-effective platform that lowers the barrier to real-world RL research and education with LEGO.",
