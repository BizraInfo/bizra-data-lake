  "synthesis_narrative": "Lexinvariant Language Models hinge on the idea that predictive power can arise from contextual structure and co-occurrence patterns rather than fixed lexical identities or learned embeddings. Classical count-based language modeling established this premise: Kneser\u2013Ney showed that robust prediction can be driven by observed co-occurrences and principled smoothing, while Teh\u2019s hierarchical Pitman\u2013Yor model framed language modeling as an exchangeable process governed by counts, matching lexinvariance by design. The theoretical backbone\u2014uniform convergence of context-based estimators\u2014draws from universal sequence prediction, particularly the Context-Tree Weighting method, which quantifies redundancy and convergence rates in finite-memory sources without appeal to token semantics.\nOn the representational side, the paper\u2019s practical recipe\u2014replace learned token embeddings with fixed random Gaussian vectors\u2014builds on random projection and random feature theory. Achlioptas\u2019 database-friendly JL results and Rahimi\u2013Recht\u2019s random features provide the justification that random mappings can preserve the geometric relations that downstream linear and attention mechanisms exploit, with dimensionality scaling benignly relative to vocabulary size. In NLP specifically, Weinberger\u2019s feature hashing and Sahlgren\u2019s random indexing supply methodological precedents that discrete identities can be mapped into compact random spaces while retaining signal through aggregation. Together, these strands converge to the paper\u2019s core contribution: a lexinvariant LM that forgoes fixed token embeddings, relies solely on contextual co-occurrence structure, and admits provable convergence guarantees with favorable dependence on context length and vocabulary size.",
