  "synthesis_narrative": "Representation learning became central to CATE estimation with Johansson et al. introducing balanced embeddings to mitigate selection bias by aligning treated and control distributions in a learned low-dimensional space. Shalit et al. provided generalization bounds that tied counterfactual risk to distributional discrepancies in representation space, further codifying dimensionality-reduced causal representations as a practical and theoretical cornerstone. Louizos et al. proposed CEVAE, compressing covariates into a latent variable intended to capture confounding, emphasizing the promise\u2014and risks\u2014of relying on learned low-dimensional proxies for adjustment. Rosenbaum and Rubin\u2019s balancing-score framework established when reduced covariates suffice for identifiability, highlighting that only sufficient summaries preserve ignorability. Veitch et al. later showed in high-dimensional settings (e.g., text) that predictive embeddings can shed confounding information and break ignorability, revealing the concrete danger of representation-induced bias. Manski\u2019s program of partial identification supplied the formal apparatus for bounding causal quantities when identifying assumptions falter, while Kallus and Zhou operationalized worst-case, minimax evaluation under unobserved confounding via optimization. Together, these works expose a gap: representation learning can inadvertently destroy the sufficiency required for identification, yet the field lacked a general, representation-agnostic way to quantify the resulting bias. Building on balancing-score theory, the partial-identification ethos, and minimax bounding techniques, the current paper formalizes conditions under which low-dimensional representations render CATE non-identifiable and introduces a neural refutation procedure that computes sharp bounds on the representation-induced confounding bias.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art methods for conditional average treatment effect (CATE) estimation make widespread use of representation learning. Here, the idea is to reduce the variance of the low-sample CATE estimation by a (potentially constrained) low-dimensional representation. However, low-dimensional representations can lose information about the observed confounders and thus lead to bias, because of which the validity of representation learning for CATE estimation is typically violated. In this paper, we propose a new, representation-agnostic refutation framework for estimating bounds on the representation-induced confounding bias that comes from dimensionality reduction (or other constraints on the representations) in CATE estimation. First, we establish theoretically under which conditions CATE is non-identifiable given low-dimensional (constrained) representations. Second, as our remedy, we propose a neural refutation framework which performs partial identification of CATE or, equivalentl",
