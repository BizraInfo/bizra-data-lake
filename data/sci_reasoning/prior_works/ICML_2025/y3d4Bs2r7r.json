  "synthesis_narrative": "RoPE\u2019s core idea\u2014correcting simulator misspecification for SBI using a small real-world calibration set and an optimal transport (OT) formulation in learned representation space\u2014emerges by bridging advances in SBI, misspecification analysis, calibration, and OT-based domain alignment. Modern amortized SBI methods, from early neural conditional density estimation to the unified APT framework, made high-dimensional, likelihood-free posterior estimation practical but left open the problem of robustness under simulator\u2013data mismatch. The misspecification literature in likelihood-free inference formally documented how such mismatch corrupts inference and coverage, motivating methods that explicitly address this gap rather than ignoring it. In parallel, simulation-based calibration established concrete coverage diagnostics and a target notion of calibrated uncertainty that RoPE aims to satisfy.\nOT provided the mathematical and computational tools to model distributional discrepancies. Sinkhorn\u2019s scalable, differentiable OT made it feasible to incorporate transport objectives into deep learning. Wasserstein-ABC showed that OT can serve as a robust discrepancy for likelihood-free inference, while OT-driven domain adaptation, especially JDOT, demonstrated how a small labeled target set can guide alignment of joint distributions. RoPE synthesizes these threads: it learns representations in which an OT problem captures the misspecification gap between simulated and real observations, using a small calibration set of true parameters to guide alignment. The result is a calibration mechanism that can be layered onto standard SBI pipelines, balancing informative posteriors with calibrated uncertainty even under severe simulator misspecification.",
