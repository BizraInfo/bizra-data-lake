  "synthesis_narrative": "Equivariant diffusion for 3D molecules established that atoms, bonds, and coordinates can be modeled coherently under SE(3) symmetry, with Equivariant Diffusion for Molecule Generation in 3D providing a practical denoising framework that couples graph and coordinate generation. E(n) Equivariant Graph Neural Networks supplied the equivariant message-passing backbone that enables robust, rotation/translation-consistent updates in such models. GeoDiff refined score parameterization and noise scheduling for stable coordinate diffusion on molecular conformations, illustrating how 3D structures can be denoised effectively. In ligand-based discovery, ROCS formalized Gaussian shape-overlap as a fast, effective similarity function for identifying bioisosteres by aligning 3D shapes. Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA) demonstrated that steric and electrostatic fields capture key interaction determinants, motivating the use of electrostatic potential fields alongside shape. Pharmit operationalized directional pharmacophore constraints and combined them with shape screening, highlighting the practical value of directional features for capturing specific interaction geometries. DiffDock showed that conditioning diffusion on 3D interaction context improves generative plausibility in protein-ligand settings, validating interaction-aware conditioning within an SE(3)-equivariant diffusion paradigm. Taken together, these works expose an opportunity: shape, electrostatics, and pharmacophores\u2014long used as separate similarity functions\u2014could be learned as a joint interaction profile within an equivariant generative model. Building on equivariant diffusion\u2019s joint graph\u2013coordinate denoising and the field-based insights from CoMFA/ROCS/Pharmit, the next step is to co-diffuse molecular structure with its interaction fields and to condition generation directly on desired 3D interaction profiles, thereby unifying ligand-based similarity objectives with modern equivariant generative modeling.",

In ligand-based drug design, bioisosteric analogues of known bioactive hits are often identified by virtually screening chemical libraries with shape, electrostatic, and pharmacophore similarity scoring functions. We instead hypothesize that a generative model which learns the joint distribution over 3D molecular structures and their interaction profiles may facilitate 3D interaction-aware chemical design. We specifically design ShEPhERD, an SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model which jointly diffuses/denoises 3D molecular graphs and representations of their shapes, electrostatic potential surfaces, and (directional) pharmacophores to/from Gaussian noise. Inspired by traditional ligand discovery, we compose 3D similarity scoring functions to assess ShEPhERD\u2019s ability to conditionally generate novel molecules with desired interaction profiles.
