  "synthesis_narrative": "Early analyses of networks trained to compute finite-group operations proposed concrete, mechanistic circuits for how small models implement the binary composition rule. One line identified consistent internal pathways and feature decompositions for these tasks, establishing the problem setting and a first partial explanation. A second, contemporary account offered a different decomposition on the same models, emphasizing an alternative internal structure and serving as a de facto competing baseline. In parallel, the equivariance literature formalized how group actions constrain neural representations: group equivariant networks established the architectural and conceptual role of equivariance, while representation-theoretic treatments characterized equivariant maps via irreducible representations and intertwiners, providing a precise toolkit for reasoning about functions on groups. Mechanistic work on modular addition, another finite-group operation, showed that gradient descent often discovers Fourier-like representations and near-equivariant internal features, suggesting a representation-theoretic basis for learned circuits. Finally, circuit-style interpretability introduced the practice of rendering mechanisms as precise, checkable claims, hinting that explanations can be turned into proofs about behavior. Taken together, these strands expose a gap: existing group-operation explanations are incompatible and unverified, yet equivariance and representation theory suggest a common template. The current paper synthesizes these ideas by positing approximate equivariance in each input argument as the unifying mechanism, formalizing it with representation theory, reconciling prior accounts, and, inspired by circuit-as-proof methodology, translating the mechanism into a compact, faster-than-brute-force certificate of model accuracy.",

We investigate the internals of one-hidden-layer neural networks trained on this task, revealing previously unidentified structure and producing a more complete description of such models in a step towards unifying the explanations of previous works (Chughtai et al., 2023; Stander et al., 2024). Notably, these models approximate equivariance in each input argument. We verify that our explanation applies to a large fraction of networks trained on this task by translating it into a compact proof of model performance, a quantitative evaluation of the extent to which we faithfully and concisely explain model internals. In the main text, we focus on the symmetric group S5. For models trained on this group, our explanation yields a guarantee of model accuracy that runs 3x faster than brute force and gives a >=9",
