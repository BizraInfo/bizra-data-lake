  "synthesis_narrative": "FamO2O targets the core offline-to-online RL challenge: distributional shift worsens during online fine-tuning, yet most methods fix a single conservatism level. Prior offline RL works established the need for constraining policy improvement. BCQ constrained action choices to the dataset support, while BEAR formalized behavior regularization with a tunable coefficient that balances improvement and conservatism. CQL pushed this further with pessimistic value learning, again exposing a crucial regularization knob. These methods, however, typically use a single global balance, which can be suboptimal when data quality varies across states.\nIn parallel, AWAC demonstrated that advantage-weighted, behavior-regularized updates can effectively bridge offline pretraining and online fine-tuning, with a temperature controlling the trade-off; IQL offered a strong alternative where an expectile governs conservatism. SPIBB highlighted that safety and robustness often require state-dependent conservatism, suggesting the limitation of one-size-fits-all regularization. Methodologically, UVFA provided the blueprint for conditioning a single network on a context variable to represent a family of solutions.\nFamO2O synthesizes these threads: it treats the regularization strength (e.g., KL weight, CQL coefficient, temperature/expectile) as a conditioning variable, trains a universal model that realizes a continuum of improvement\u2013constraint balances, and then performs state-adaptive selection during online fine-tuning. This turns the static global knob into a per-state decision, better leveraging heterogeneous data and mitigating distributional shift in the offline-to-online regime.",
