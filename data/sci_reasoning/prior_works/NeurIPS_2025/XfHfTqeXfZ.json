  "synthesis_narrative": "MonarchAttention\u2019s core contribution\u2014zero-shot conversion of standard attention into a fast, tensor-core\u2013friendly structured approximation\u2014emerges by combining three strands of prior work. First, the structured approximation of the attention matrix traces to low-rank and sparse designs such as Linformer, Performer, Nystr\u00f6mformer, and BigBird. These works established that the softmax attention operator admits constrained representations that can reduce the quadratic cost while preserving accuracy, motivating MonarchAttention\u2019s decision to approximate the attention map itself rather than alter model architecture or retrain. Second, MonarchAttention\u2019s choice of Monarch-style structured operators is grounded in the butterfly/structured-matrix lineage, which shows that compositions of permutations and small dense blocks can be highly expressive while enabling sub-quadratic multiplication. This lineage provides both the theoretical expressivity and the practical building blocks for mapping the approximation to dense GEMMs that run well on modern GPUs. Third, the method\u2019s optimization-based projection leverages the variational (convex conjugate) form of log-sum-exp/softmax, allowing an efficient procedure to compute a data-dependent projection onto the Monarch class. Finally, the system-level performance and IO complexity reflect the design principles popularized by FlashAttention\u2014IO-aware tiling and tensor-core utilization\u2014ensuring that the theoretical savings translate into end-to-end wall-time speedups without additional training. Together, these influences enable a transferable, hardware-efficient, sub-quadratic attention approximation.",
