  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014a vocabulary-centric view of Graph Foundation Models (GFMs)\u2014is assembled from three pillars: network analysis building blocks, expressiveness guarantees, and stability under perturbations. Network science first articulated the idea of reusable subgraph units via motifs (Milo et al.), positing that recurring patterns are the natural primitives of complex graphs. The Weisfeiler\u2013Lehman (WL) kernel operationalized this intuition into computable, isomorphism-invariant subtree features that function as an implicit graph vocabulary. GNN expressiveness theory (Xu et al.) then linked modern architectures to WL power, highlighting the need for representations that encode such invariances to be broadly transferable. Moving beyond message passing, Graph Substructure Networks (Bouritsas et al.) demonstrated that explicitly injecting counts of cycles and cliques\u2014an explicit subgraph vocabulary\u2014extends expressiveness and improves generalization.\nConcurrently, the trajectory toward GFMs emerged from large-scale pretraining on diverse graphs. Hu et al. showcased that self-supervised pretraining with node/edge/subgraph-level objectives yields positive transfer, while GROVER instantiated motif- and context-level predictions at scale, effectively treating chemical substructures as tokens. Finally, stability theory from diffusion scattering (Gama et al.) supplied the robustness criterion: vocabulary elements should be invariant to permutations and stable to small topology/feature perturbations to ensure reliable transfer across datasets. Together, these works converge on the position paper\u2019s thesis: GFMs should be built around a graph vocabulary\u2014expressive, motif-grounded, and stability-aware primitives\u2014that enable scalable pretraining and broad downstream adaptability.",
