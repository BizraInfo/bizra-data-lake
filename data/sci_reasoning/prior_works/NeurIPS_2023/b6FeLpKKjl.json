  "synthesis_narrative": "Ward and Kolda\u2019s core contribution\u2014global, linear-rate convergence of alternating gradient descent for asymmetric matrix factorization with mild over-parameterization from a tailored random initialization\u2014sits at the intersection of three lines of prior work. First, Karimi\u2013Nutini\u2013Schmidt established the Polyak\u2013\u0141ojasiewicz (PL) framework that converts a uniform PL inequality plus smoothness into an iteration complexity of O((L/\u03bc) log(1/\u03b5)). Ward and Kolda\u2019s analysis hinges on proving such a uniform PL bound for the full-observation factorized objective, which directly yields the stated rate with condition-number dependence (\u03c31/\u03c3r)\u00b2.\nSecond, a decade of results on nonconvex low-rank factorization shaped both the algorithmic template and the geometric expectations. Jain\u2013Netrapalli\u2013Sanghavi\u2019s alternating minimization with spectral initialization highlighted how alternating updates can attain linear convergence when properly initialized, and inspired the AGD variant studied here. The Burer\u2013Monteiro factorization philosophy and subsequent benign-landscape results (Bhojanapalli\u2013Neyshabur\u2013Srebro; Ge\u2013Jin\u2013Zheng) justified working in over-parameterized factors and suggested that, away from saddle sets, global convergence should be attainable.\nThird, nonconvex matrix completion analyses (e.g., 2016-era works showing linear rates from spectral/warm starts) emphasized the power of tailored initializations for achieving fast global convergence. Ward and Kolda advance this by proposing an \u201catypical\u201d but simple random initialization that, together with mild over-parameterization, places the iterates in a region where a uniform PL inequality holds, enabling a clean, global AGD analysis and practical speedups without relying on sampling or problem-specific incoherence assumptions.",
