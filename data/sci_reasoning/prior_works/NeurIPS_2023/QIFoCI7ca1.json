  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014casting structural causal models in the language of autoregressive normalizing flows, proving identifiability under a known causal ordering via nonlinear ICA, and operationalizing interventions and counterfactuals\u2014emerges from two converging threads. First, the SCM formalism of Pearl provides the target semantics: interventions via the do-operator and counterfactuals via abduction\u2013action\u2013prediction. Second, the ICA\u2013causality lineage (LiNGAM) established that causal discovery can be grounded in latent-source identifiability, a perspective extended to nonlinear settings through modern nonlinear ICA theory (Hyv\u00e4rinen & Morioka) and its unifying identifiability results in iVAE. These results justify that, with an ordering, one can recover structural mechanisms from observational data.\nOn the modeling side, flow-based generative models\u2014especially MAF\u2019s triangular autoregressive parameterization and Real NVP\u2019s efficient invertible couplings\u2014supply practical, likelihood-trained, invertible mappings perfectly aligned with causal factorizations. This triangularity directly mirrors a causal ordering, enabling each node\u2019s mechanism to be learned as a conditional flow with tractable Jacobians and sampling. Finally, prior work on deep structural causal models using invertible networks demonstrated that invertibility enables abduction of exogenous noise and thus tractable counterfactual inference, a capability the present paper systematizes for normalizing flows. Together, these works yield a principled and practical recipe: exploit nonlinear ICA identifiability to recover SCMs from observations, instantiate mechanisms as autoregressive flows consistent with a causal order, and implement interventions/counterfactuals by manipulating flow components in the SCM.",
