  "synthesis_narrative": "ATHENA\u2019s core contribution\u2014an adaptive textual-symbolic framework that first discovers robust group-level utility functions and then performs individual-level semantic adaptation\u2014sits at the intersection of classic discrete choice theory, symbolic regression, and LLM-enabled reasoning. McFadden\u2019s random utility model established the statistical backbone for modeling choice as utility maximization, while Ben-Akiva and Lerman operationalized attribute-driven specifications in domains like travel mode choice, informing ATHENA\u2019s economically grounded search space. Train\u2019s treatment of preference heterogeneity via mixed logit motivates ATHENA\u2019s second stage: transitioning from a population utility to individual-level adjustment, but advancing from numeric random coefficients to personalized semantic templates that capture idiosyncratic constraints and preferences.\nProspect Theory underscores that framing and context systematically shape decisions, justifying ATHENA\u2019s inclusion of linguistic information as first-class signals rather than noise. On the modeling front, AI Feynman shows how symbolic regression can yield interpretable functional forms; ATHENA extends this by constraining the search toward utility-theoretic structures and guiding it with language-based priors. Finally, advances in LLM reasoning\u2014Chain-of-Thought for faithful stepwise inference and ReAct for interleaving reasoning with tool use\u2014enable ATHENA to textualize the discovery process and to iteratively call optimization or symbolic tools, producing interpretable group utilities and individualized semantic adaptations. Together, these strands directly coalesce into ATHENA\u2019s two-stage, human-centric decision modeling approach validated on travel mode and vaccine uptake tasks.",
