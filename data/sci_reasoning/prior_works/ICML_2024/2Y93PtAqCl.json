  "synthesis_narrative": "The core of this paper is to make visual prompts data-aware by initializing them with downstream token prototypes that share high mutual information with patch tokens, thereby eliminating VPT\u2019s notorious sensitivity to initialization/length and boosting performance on self-supervised backbones. This builds squarely on VPT, which operationalized the idea of learnable visual prompts for ViTs but left open how to initialize them meaningfully and why they falter under self-supervised pretraining. The broader prompt-learning foundation comes from Prefix-Tuning in NLP and CoOp in vision-language models, both of which established continuous prompts as a lightweight adaptation interface while exposing their sensitivity and transfer challenges\u2014issues this work tackles head-on in a pure-vision setting. Two lines of work directly inspire the \u201cprototype-from-tokens\u201d mechanism: TokenLearner shows that a small set of tokens distilled from patch tokens can represent images well, suggesting that prompts should be constructed from patch-token statistics; ToMe demonstrates token merging/clustering can be done with minimal overhead, informing the paper\u2019s streamlined token-construction pipeline. Finally, MAE defines the challenging self-supervised pretraining regime where VPT underdelivers; aligning prompts with downstream token prototypes directly addresses this gap. Together, these works form a clear lineage: from prompt-based conditioning, to token summarization/merging, to a data-driven prompt initialization that materially improves visual tuning.",
