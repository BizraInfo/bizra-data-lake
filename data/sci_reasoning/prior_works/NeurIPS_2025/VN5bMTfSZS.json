  "synthesis_narrative": "OCTDiff\u2019s core advances arise at the intersection of diffusion modeling for super-resolution, improved denoising dynamics, and attention mechanisms tailored to medical imaging. DDPM established the reverse denoising process that OCTDiff inherits for conditional image-to-image generation, while Improved DDPMs and EDM highlighted how noise schedules, variance parameterization, and sigma-conditioning critically shape stability and fidelity. Building on these insights, OCTDiff\u2019s Adaptive Noise Aggregation (ANA) adaptively fuses noise-level\u2013conditioned predictions across timesteps to stabilize and accelerate the reverse process under the high noise and limited-data regimes of portable OCT.\nSR3 demonstrated that diffusion is a powerful paradigm for super-resolution via iterative refinement, directly motivating OCTDiff\u2019s image-conditioned diffusion for OCT enhancement. To preserve subtle retinal microstructures, OCTDiff strengthens the conditioning pathway with Multi-Scale Cross-Attention (MSCA), inspired by LDM\u2019s multi-resolution cross-attention in UNet but repurposed to align low-/high-quality OCT features rather than text-image signals. This is further grounded in the medical imaging literature by Attention U-Net, which showed that attention within UNet helps focus on salient anatomy.\nFinally, while perceptual losses are standard for visually faithful SR, OCTDiff replaces generic perceptual proxies with clinician-driven quality scores, aligning optimization with diagnostic utility. Together, these lines of work directly inform OCTDiff\u2019s bridged diffusion formulation: a stabilized, clinically guided, attention-augmented diffusion pipeline that upgrades portable OCT images while preserving fine retinal structures.",
