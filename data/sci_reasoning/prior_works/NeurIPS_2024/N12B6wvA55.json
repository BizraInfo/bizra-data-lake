  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014lifting mirror descent and preconditioned gradient descent to Wasserstein space with convergence under relative smoothness/convexity\u2014rests on two intertwined pillars: non-Euclidean first-order optimization and the geometry of optimal transport. Nemirovsky and Yudin introduced mirror descent as a Bregman-regularized method, while Lu\u2013Freund\u2013Nesterov formalized relative smoothness/strong convexity and clarified the equivalence between mirror descent and preconditioned gradient updates via a reference function. The present work transports these ideas from Rd to the space of probability measures by defining the appropriate Bregman regularizers on measures and adapting the relative conditions to hold along carefully chosen curves.\nOn the geometric side, the JKO scheme and the AGS theory provide the variational and metric foundations for discrete-time and continuous-time Wasserstein gradient flows, including the notions of geodesic (displacement) convexity that drive convergence. McCann\u2019s displacement convexity identifies which functionals behave convexly along Wasserstein geodesics, guiding the authors\u2019 selection of curve families and compatible objective\u2013regularizer pairings. For preconditioning, generalized transport metrics with mobility weights (Dolbeault\u2013Nazaret\u2013Savar\u00e9) supply a conceptual bridge: altering the geometry corresponds to a preconditioned flow, which the paper discretizes to obtain provably convergent algorithms. Finally, the Benamou\u2013Brenier dynamic formulation grounds the characterization of transport paths along which the relative smoothness/convexity conditions are verified. Together, these works directly shape the paper\u2019s algorithmic designs and proofs.",
