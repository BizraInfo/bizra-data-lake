  "synthesis_narrative": "This paper\u2019s core insight\u2014equating a constant number of transformer self-attention layers with a constant number of Massively Parallel Computation (MPC) rounds\u2014sits at the intersection of transformer expressivity and parallel algorithm theory. The architectural substrate comes from Vaswani et al. (2017), whose self-attention mechanism is the object of formal simulation. Karloff\u2013Suri\u2013Vassilvitskii (2010) provide the MPC abstraction and round/communication constraints, which the authors adopt to formalize attention\u2019s capability as a parallel communication primitive. Prior expressivity work such as Yun et al. (2020) framed transformers in circuit-theoretic terms; the present paper advances this by pinning layer depth to MPC round complexity, yielding the headline result that logarithmic depth suffices for basic algorithmic tasks classically solved via parallelism (e.g., via pointer-jumping and related primitives).\n\nOn the limitations side, Hahn (2020) highlighted depth as a critical bottleneck for self-attention, which this work contextualizes: depth is precisely parallel communication budget. Against other sequence models, results like Weiss\u2013Goldberg\u2013Yahav (2018) position finite-precision RNNs as essentially sequential/finite-state, explaining why they fail on tasks the log-depth transformer can solve. Finally, by analyzing sub-quadratic attention schemes (Linformer, BigBird), the paper isolates constrained global communication as the culprit: reduced connectivity undermines the constant-round MPC equivalence and yields separations on basic tasks. Collectively, these threads crystallize the paper\u2019s contribution: parallelism\u2014and the ability to perform global, round-efficient communication\u2014is the distinguishing computational resource of transformers.",
