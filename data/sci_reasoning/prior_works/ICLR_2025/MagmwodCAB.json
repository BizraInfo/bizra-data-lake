  "synthesis_narrative": "3DIS is built on the realization that robust multi-instance generation is hard when a single renderer must simultaneously handle geometry (where objects go) and appearance (what they look like). Two threads of prior work converge to its decoupled design. First, grounded and compositional T2I methods such as GLIGEN and MultiDiffusion define the MIG setting\u2014placing multiple instances via boxes/regions and regional prompts\u2014but expose key pain points: spatial-appearance entanglement, composition instability, and poor portability to state-of-the-art backbones. Second, controllable diffusion via external conditions showed that specialized structural priors can steer strong base models without retraining. ControlNet demonstrated that pretrained conditional branches can reliably render fine-grained details from guidance maps, while T2I-Adapter introduced lightweight adapters to inject new control signals into diffusion networks. 3DIS unifies these insights: it leverages LDM3D\u2019s RGBD generation by adding a custom adapter to produce a coherent coarse scene depth for exact instance positioning, then reuses pretrained ControlNet modules to render high-fidelity attributes on any foundation model without finetuning. In contrast to text-only attention steering like Attend-and-Excite, 3DIS guarantees object presence and spatial correctness by anchoring geometry first. The result is a universal, two-stage MIG pipeline that directly addresses the instability and integration hurdles of prior MIG systems by explicitly decoupling layout (depth) from appearance (attribute rendering).",
