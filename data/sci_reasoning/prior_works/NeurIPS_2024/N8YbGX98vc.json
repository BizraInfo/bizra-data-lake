  "synthesis_narrative": "TFG\u2019s core contribution\u2014an algorithm-agnostic, theoretically grounded framework that unifies training-free guidance for diffusion models\u2014builds on two pillars: the score-based theory of conditional generation and a diverse set of practical, inference-time guidance mechanisms. The SDE formulation of score-based generative modeling formalized that conditioning is achieved by augmenting the prior score with the gradient of the conditional likelihood, directly motivating TFG\u2019s view of guidance as adding a predictor-driven gradient term. Dhariwal and Nichol\u2019s classifier guidance instantiated this idea with \u2207 log p(y|x_t) from a noisy-image classifier, revealing practical knobs such as noise-dependent strength; Ho and Salimans\u2019 classifier-free guidance crystallized the notion of a tunable guidance scale and schedules that trade off fidelity and diversity.\n\nSubsequent training-free conditioning methods exposed the breadth and brittleness of these knobs. GLIDE\u2019s CLIP-guided sampling showed that external predictors can steer diffusion without retraining, but require delicate, task-specific tuning. Inverse-problem methods like DDRM and DPS demonstrated training-free conditioning via projection or data-consistency gradients, further diversifying where and how guidance can be injected in the sampling trajectory. TFG identifies the common structure across these approaches\u2014predictor choice, normalization, timing, and strength scheduling\u2014and provides theoretical analysis and a robust hyperparameter search strategy that applies uniformly across models and tasks. By encompassing classifier-guided, CLIP-guided, and inverse-problem guidance as special cases, TFG converts a fragmented set of heuristics into a unified design space, delivering consistent performance gains across a wide benchmark.",
