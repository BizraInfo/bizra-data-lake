  "synthesis_narrative": "This paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014a tight characterization of when inductive inference (finite errors/mind changes) is possible\u2014sits at the intersection of formal learning theory and modern online learning. Gold\u2019s seminal formulation of identification in the limit and the finite-error criterion, refined and systematized by Osherson, Stob, and Weinstein, supplies the target notion of success. Historically, Solomonoff\u2019s universal induction provided the principal general positive result: if the hypothesis class is countable and each hypothesis receives nonzero prior, one obtains convergence guarantees, a perspective later developed comprehensively by Hutter. Yet these results left the boundary of possibility largely at \u201ccountable,\u201d without revealing the structural reasons some classes admit finite-error identification.\n\nThe paper advances beyond mere countability by importing the structure of online learnability. Littlestone\u2019s mistake-bound model and the associated dimension, together with later characterizations by Ben-David, P\u00e1l, and Shalev-Shwartz, furnish precise criteria for when a class supports bounded or sublinear mistakes/regret in the realizable/agnostic online settings. Leveraging expert-aggregation methods codified by Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi, the paper shows how to mix learners over a countable family of online-learnable subclasses. This yields a necessary and sufficient condition: inductive inference is possible exactly when the hypothesis class can be expressed as a countable union of online-learnable components. Conceptually, the result replaces an unstructured countability assumption with a learnability-driven decomposition, unifying classical inductive inference with the algorithmic guarantees and combinatorial parameters of online learning.",
