  "synthesis_narrative": "Transition-Constant Normalization (TCN) views image enhancement as a style transformation problem and operationalizes it through a new normalization that preserves information and statistics across processing stages. This perspective is rooted in the style-transfer literature: Instance Normalization established that channel-wise mean and variance encode image style, while AdaIN showed that aligning these statistics suffices for real-time, parameter-free control of style. WCT further demonstrated that carefully designed, training-free feature transforms (whitening and coloring) can manipulate both mean/variance and covariance structures to achieve universal style transfer.\nBuilding on these foundations, TCN departs from conventional norms by arranging two normalization streams under an explicit invertibility constraint to avoid content degradation\u2014a critical property for photo enhancement where fidelity matters. The dual-path design resonates with IBN-Net\u2019s combination of IN and BN to balance appearance invariance and content preservation, but TCN makes the mechanism parameter-free and provably information-preserving. Flow-based generative models such as RealNVP and Glow provide the architectural principles for enforcing bijectivity and efficient multi-scale processing, which TCN adapts to normalization rather than density modeling. Finally, TCN\u2019s feature sub-sampling that satisfies normalization constraints parallels the space-to-depth/pixel-shuffle rearrangement, enabling cost-free, information-preserving down/up-sampling in encoder\u2013decoder pipelines. Together, these works directly shape TCN\u2019s core: a plug-and-play, parameter-free, invertible normalization tailored for image enhancement.",
