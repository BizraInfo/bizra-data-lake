  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014CPG-PE, a spike-native, hardware-friendly positional encoding for SNNs\u2014emerges at the intersection of positional encoding theory, oscillator-based modeling, and practical SNN training for sequential tasks. The modern PE lineage begins with Vaswani et al., whose sinusoidal positional encoding is the de facto baseline; the authors theoretically show this sinusoid is a particular solution to a CPG\u2019s membrane dynamics. RoPE further reframed position as phase rotation, strengthening the oscillator perspective and motivating a phase-controlled PE that aligns naturally with rhythmic neural dynamics. Complementing this, Fourier-feature theory (Tancik et al.) establishes why multi-frequency sinusoids serve as powerful coordinate embeddings, providing a principled basis for composing and tuning oscillatory components. On the biological and mathematical side, Matsuoka\u2019s classic CPG oscillator and Ijspeert\u2019s comprehensive review supply the core principles\u2014intrinsic rhythmicity without rhythmic input, tunable frequency/phase, and robustness\u2014that the paper instantiates in a neuromorphic-compatible PE generator producing spikes. Finally, advances demonstrating SNNs\u2019 aptitude for sequential processing (Bellec et al.) make the case that explicit temporal/positional signals can boost performance, while surrogate-gradient training (Neftci et al.) enables integrating and learning such modules end-to-end. Together, these works converge to a coherent insight: position can be encoded by controlled biological oscillators whose dynamics both subsume sinusoidal PE and yield efficient, spike-form signals suited for SNN hardware and diverse sequential tasks.",
