  "synthesis_narrative": "The SRRW framework crystallizes at the intersection of variance-optimal MCMC and self-interacting random walks. Peskun\u2019s seminal ordering and Tierney\u2019s generalization established asymptotic-variance minimization as the central design goal for MCMC kernels and linked transition rules to estimator variance. Seeking stronger variance reduction than fixed kernels allow, the SRRW embraces a history-dependent mechanism inspired by reinforced/self-repellent walks: Pemantle\u2019s vertex-reinforced random walk pioneered transitions driven by visitation counts, while T\u00f3th and Werner\u2019s self-repelling motion demonstrated how discouraging revisits can dramatically reduce self-intersections and temporal correlation. However, classic self-reinforcement/repulsion lacks guarantees of sampling from a prescribed target distribution. SRRW addresses this gap by embedding repulsion within a nonlinear MCMC construction that provably preserves the stationary distribution of an underlying base kernel. Technically, the work leverages theory for adaptive/interacting MCMC\u2014particularly Fort, Moulines, and Priouret\u2019s LLN/CLT results\u2014to control history-dependent dynamics and to derive limit theorems. For the covariance analysis, SRRW adapts Kipnis\u2013Varadhan\u2019s Poisson-equation/functional-CLT machinery to compute exact asymptotic covariance and to show monotone variance reduction with stronger repellence. Finally, results on non-backtracking random walks by Alon et al. provide corroborating intuition that anti-recurrence reduces dependency, but SRRW advances this idea to a global, principled, variance-minimizing scheme that retains the intended stationary distribution on general graphs.",
