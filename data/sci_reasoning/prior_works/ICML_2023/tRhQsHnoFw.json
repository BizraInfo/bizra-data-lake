  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core idea\u2014designing frequentist-optimal sequential learning algorithms through Bayesian principles\u2014draws directly on the information-theoretic lineage of Bayesian posterior methods. Information-Directed Sampling (Russo & Van Roy, 2014) provided the key design insight: use Bayesian beliefs to choose actions that minimize a regret proxy tied to information gain. The subsequent information-theoretic analysis of Thompson Sampling (Russo & Van Roy, 2016) formalized regret\u2013information tradeoffs, giving a template for bounding frequentist regret via Bayesian quantities. Building on these, the present work removes the need for a true prior by optimizing \u2018algorithmic beliefs\u2019 each round, preserving posterior-based decision making while making it prior-free and adversarially robust. Thompson Sampling (Agrawal & Goyal, 2012) and Posterior Sampling for RL (Osband et al., 2013) are the canonical Bayesian baselines whose limitations\u2014reliance on correct priors and stochastic assumptions\u2014the new framework directly addresses by substituting optimized beliefs for true priors. On the performance side, the goal of unifying stochastic and adversarial regimes traces to best-of-both-worlds bandits (Bubeck & Slivkins, 2012) and its practical instantiation EXP3++ (Seldin & Slivkins, 2014); the new algorithm achieves these guarantees within a Bayesian design and further extends to non-stationarity. This extension is anchored by the non-stationary bandit formulation of Besbes, Gur & Zeevi (2014), whose variation-budget model is explicitly captured in the belief-optimization objectives. Together, these works form the direct intellectual scaffold for the paper\u2019s prior-free Bayesian design principles.",
