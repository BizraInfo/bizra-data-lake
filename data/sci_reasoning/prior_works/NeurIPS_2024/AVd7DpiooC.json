  "synthesis_narrative": "QKFormer fuses three intellectual streams to close the SNN\u2013ANN performance gap while retaining neuromorphic efficiency. From the vision-transformer lineage, ViT provides the token/patch-embedding blueprint, while Swin introduces a hierarchical, multi-scale token design. QKFormer adopts both: it keeps a ViT-like tokenization but varies token counts across blocks in Swin\u2019s spirit to realize scalable, multi-resolution spiking representations.\nFrom efficient attention, linear-attention work demonstrated that moving away from quadratic dot-product attention is pivotal for scalability. QKFormer\u2019s spike-form Q\u2013K attention follows this trajectory but reframes it for SNNs: queries and keys are binary spike vectors, enabling linear-time computations and memory savings tailored to event-driven hardware.\nFrom neuromorphic learning, surrogate-gradient training provides the mechanism for direct optimization of spiking modules, and residual SNN designs (e.g., SEW-ResNet) highlight the importance of carefully engineered shortcuts to preserve and mix temporal-spatial information. QKFormer\u2019s SPEDS extends these ideas with a deformed shortcut to stabilize and enrich spiking patch embeddings.\nFinally, early spiking transformers established the feasibility of attention within SNNs; QKFormer advances that paradigm with a binary Q\u2013K mechanism that exploits XNOR/popcount-style efficiency from binary networks, translating proven bitwise compute gains into the attention core. Together, these prior works converge to enable QKFormer\u2019s linear-complexity, hierarchical spiking transformer with improved energy efficiency and accuracy.",
