  "synthesis_narrative": "The core contribution of \u201cFearless Stochasticity in Expectation Propagation\u201d is to recast EP\u2019s moment-matching updates as natural-gradient steps on a variational objective, which in turn yields EP variants that remain stable and sample-efficient even with extremely noisy (single-sample) Monte Carlo estimates. This builds directly on the foundational mechanics of EP (Minka, 2001), where site/cavity construction and moment matching define the update rule, and on the variational/energy characterizations of EP fixed points (Opper & Winther, 2005), which supply the objective that the authors optimize. Power EP (Minka, 2004) further links EP to \u03b1-divergences and fractional/damped updates, foreshadowing the paper\u2019s unification of stability and tuning within an optimization perspective. \n\nPractical black-box and stochastic lines of work exposed the fragility of naive MC-based EP. Stochastic Expectation Propagation (Li et al., 2015) introduced stochastic site updates for scalability but suffered tuning and stability challenges, while Black-box \u03b1-divergence Minimization (Hern\u00e1ndez-Lobato et al., 2016) showed how to optimize \u03b1-objectives with MC gradients, hinting at MC-compatible EP-like procedures. The decisive conceptual bridge comes from natural-gradient variational inference: Amari (1998) provides the information-geometric foundations, and Khan & Lin (2017) illuminate how EP-like updates emerge as natural-gradient steps, especially in conjugate structures. \n\nSynthesizing these strands, the paper formalizes EP moment matching as natural-gradient optimization of a suitable variational objective and designs update rules inherently robust to MC noise, eliminating reliance on debiasing while improving the speed\u2013accuracy\u2013tuning trade-offs. This yields EP variants that retain EP\u2019s accuracy benefits yet are \u201cfearless\u201d under stochastic estimation.",
