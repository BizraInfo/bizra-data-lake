  "synthesis_narrative": "Conformal prediction\u2019s core logic\u2014validity from exchangeability\u2014was crystallized by Vovk, Gammerman, and Shafer, establishing finite-sample guarantees derived from order statistics. Split conformal prediction then operationalized this theory for modern learning by fitting on a training split and calibrating on a holdout to obtain marginal coverage with minimal O(1/n) slack. Risk-Controlling Prediction Sets pushed beyond coverage by tuning prediction-set procedures to satisfy average loss constraints in classification, demonstrating that risk-style control could be distribution-free but remaining tied to specific indicator losses and set constructions. Conformalized Quantile Regression showed how to conformalize a quantile functional using order statistics, offering a template to guarantee quantiles rather than expectations. Under distribution shift, weighted conformal prediction introduced importance-weighted calibration to target test-distribution guarantees, and adaptive conformal inference highlighted recalibration strategies for nonstationary settings. Finally, Mondrian (group-conditional) conformal predictors established that partitioned, groupwise calibration can deliver simultaneous guarantees across multiple subpopulations.\nTogether, these works exposed a natural generalization: use the split conformal calibration mechanism and exchangeability logic to control not just coverage but the expected value (and quantiles) of any monotone loss, while retaining finite-sample tightness. Importance weighting and adaptive/groupwise calibration furnish principled routes to extend this control under distribution shift and across multiple or adversarially chosen constraints. By unifying RCPS-style risk goals with split conformal calibration, quantile conformalization, and groupwise/weighted adaptations, the resulting framework delivers distribution-free guarantees for broad loss-based risks in a single, simple procedure.",

Like conformal prediction, the conformal risk control procedure is tight up to an $\\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ factor. We also introduce extensions of the idea to distribution shift, quantile risk control, multiple and adversarial risk control, and expectations of U-statistics. Worked examples from computer vision and natural language processing demonstrate the usage of our algorithm to bound the false negative rate, graph distance, and token-level F1-score.",
