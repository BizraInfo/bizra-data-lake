  "synthesis_narrative": "LoRATv2\u2019s core advance\u2014low-cost temporal modeling for one-stream trackers\u2014sits at the intersection of three lines of work: transformer-based tracking, parameter-efficient adaptation, and streaming/causal attention with memory. OSTrack and STARK established strong transformer backbones for tracking and highlighted the need to model temporal dynamics within the template\u2013search paradigm. LoRAT then demonstrated that low-rank adapters can adapt powerful one-stream trackers efficiently by freezing the ViT backbone. Building directly on this, LoRATv2 introduces Stream-Specific LoRA Adapters, a targeted refinement that acknowledges the asymmetric temporal roles of template and search streams created by causal attention, thereby preserving efficiency while improving specialization.\nOn the temporal modeling side, LoRATv2 replaces standard quadratic attention across frames with frame-wise full attention combined with causal cross-frame dependencies. This design is conceptually aligned with TimeSformer\u2019s factorization of spatial and temporal attention, but tailored to the streaming setting. The efficiency leap draws on Transformer-XL\u2019s causal attention and key\u2013value caching, transposed to vision, and is further informed by MeMViT\u2019s memory-based reuse of past features for long-range video reasoning. Together, these influences yield a tracker that maintains rich intra-frame modeling, introduces principled causal temporal dependencies, and leverages KV caching to avoid recomputation\u2014delivering real-time performance without sacrificing accuracy.",
