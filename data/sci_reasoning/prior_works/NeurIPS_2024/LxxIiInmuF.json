  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s central contribution\u2014characterizing when there exists a satisficing path that reaches equilibrium\u2014sits at the intersection of classical improvement-path analysis and modern MARL policy updates. Monderer and Shapley\u2019s Potential Games established that better/best-response paths can converge (finite improvement property), supplying the paradigm of path-based reasoning the authors generalize beyond potential structure. Young\u2019s adaptive play introduced inertia, capturing the stay-if-best behavioral rule that the paper operationalizes as its defining pairwise constraint for satisficing paths. Complementing these positive insights, Shapley\u2019s cycling example revealed that unconstrained best-response dynamics may fail to converge, and Hart\u2013Mas-Colell proved that broad classes of uncoupled dynamics cannot guarantee Nash convergence\u2014together motivating the paper\u2019s shift from proposing a single dynamic to asking an existence-of-path question under minimal local constraints.\n\nOn the learning side, Robinson\u2019s foundational view of games as sequences of iterative responses underpins the paper\u2019s sequence-of-strategies framing. In reinforcement learning, Kakade\u2013Langford\u2019s conservative policy iteration crystallizes monotonic policy improvement\u2014the single-agent analogue of not switching when already optimal\u2014directly inspiring the satisficing constraint. Finally, modern MARL methods such as PSRO explicitly generate sequences via best responses and meta-strategy updates, providing the practical algorithmic context where satisficing paths naturally occur. By synthesizing these strands, the paper isolates a minimal, behaviorally and algorithmically plausible constraint and asks a sharp, structural question about path existence to equilibrium across games.",
