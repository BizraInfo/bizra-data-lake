  "synthesis_narrative": "Score-based and denoising diffusion approaches for tabular data established that each synthetic row is generated from an independently sampled Gaussian latent, with TabDDPM codifying a widely used backbone and STaSy demonstrating effective handling of mixed-type columns via per-instance noise initialization. Concurrently, diffusion watermarking for images revealed a crucial lever: manipulating the initial noise can embed robust, model-agnostic signatures, as Tree-Ring Watermarks showed by encoding signals directly in the Gaussian latent rather than retraining the generator. In parallel, LLM watermarking introduced secret-keyed, position-dependent hashing to steer generation toward detectable distributions, with statistical detection that remains resilient to post-editing. Longstanding database watermarking further showed how key-driven tuple selection and permutation-tolerant embedding can enable row-wise traceability despite row reordering and common table operations. By contrast, model-embedded diffusion watermarks (e.g., Stable Signature) underscored deployment limitations when generator access or retraining is required. Together, these works suggested a natural opportunity: harness the per-row Gaussian latent in tabular diffusion as the watermark carrier, but encode the key through the positional structure of seeds rather than content perturbations, enabling row-level detectability at scale. Building on LLM-style keyed hashing, seed self-cloning and shuffling realize position-aware signaling, while a valid-bit focus on distribution tails analogizes green-list selection to boost robustness against noisy post-edits\u2014all without modifying the diffusion backbone.",

Till date, it remains unknown how to use watermarking techniques to trace and audit synthetic tables generated by tabular diffusion models to mitigate potential misuses. In this paper, we design TabWak, the first watermarking method to embed invisible signatures that control the sampling of Gaussian latent codes used to synthesize table rows via the diffusion backbone. TabWak has two key features. Different from existing image watermarking techniques, TabWak uses self-cloning and shuffling to embed the secret key in positional information of random seeds that control the Gaussian latents, allowing to use different seeds at each row for high inter-row diversity and enabling row-wise detectability. To further boost the robustness of watermark detection against post-editing attacks, TabWak uses a valid-bit mechanism that focuses on the tail of the latent code distribution for superior noise resilience.
