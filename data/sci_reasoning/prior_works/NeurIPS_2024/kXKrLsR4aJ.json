  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014an Input-to-State Stable Coupled Oscillator Network (CON) that enables closed-form, model-based control in a learned latent space\u2014sits at the intersection of three lines of work. First, latent-space control emerged from models such as Embed to Control and Koopman with inputs, which made planning tractable but suffered from a lack of mechanical structure, weak stability guarantees, and ambiguous input mappings. These limitations are precisely the pain points the authors target. Second, the physics-structured modeling wave\u2014Hamiltonian Neural Networks and especially Deep Lagrangian Networks\u2014showed that learning energy-based or Lagrangian forms yields dynamics with interpretable mass matrices and forces. This makes classical control synthesis applicable in principle, but prior efforts did not fully resolve input robustness and invertible actuation in latent space.\nPassivity-based control and energy shaping (IDA-PBC) provide the closed-form design the authors wish to exploit: shaping potentials and injecting damping to stabilize desired equilibria. To make such designs viable after representation learning, the latent model must guarantee properties akin to real mechanical systems. Here, ISS theory (Sontag) supplies the robustness lens the authors adopt to ensure inputs do not destroy stability. Finally, inspiration from dynamical movement primitives and coupled oscillators motivates a low-dimensional, oscillator-based latent parameterization with attractive, well-behaved second-order structure. By combining these ingredients, the authors construct CON: a Lagrangian, ISS-guaranteed latent model with an explicit, invertible input-to-force mapping, enabling direct application of energy-shaping controllers in learned latent spaces.",
