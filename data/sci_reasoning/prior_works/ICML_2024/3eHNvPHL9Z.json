  "synthesis_narrative": "The present work explains why a neural network sampled uniformly over parameters, conditioned on interpolating the data, can nonetheless generalize: a flat parameter prior induces a highly non-uniform prior over functions that favors simpler hypotheses, especially those implementable by narrow networks. This insight directly builds on the function-space view inaugurated by Neal (1996) and modernized by Lee et al. (2018), which assert that distributions over weights define priors over functions. Valle-P\u00e9rez et al. (2018) and Mingard et al. (2020) then argued and quantified that the parameter\u2013function map is exponentially biased toward simple functions because many more parameter settings realize them\u2014precisely the mechanism this paper formalizes for the conditional distribution over interpolators. The central motivation arises from the interpolation generalization puzzle articulated by Zhang et al. (2017) and Belkin et al. (2019): despite fitting the data exactly, overparameterized networks often generalize, a phenomenon this work explains without relying on optimization dynamics. Finally, the paper\u2019s \u2018narrow teacher\u2019 assumption mirrors the low effective complexity conditions underpinning benign overfitting in linear models (Bartlett et al., 2020), translating that intuition to nonlinear networks: when labels are realizable by a smaller (narrow) network, the induced function prior concentrates mass on such simpler solutions. Together, these works directly shape the paper\u2019s core innovation: a rigorous, function-prior explanation for why typical interpolating neural networks generalize under narrow teachers.",
