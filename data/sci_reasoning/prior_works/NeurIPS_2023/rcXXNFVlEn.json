  "synthesis_narrative": "The core contribution of Prystawski, Li, and Goodman is a mechanistic account of why step-by-step reasoning helps language models: when training data comprise overlapping local clusters, an autoregressive learner can reduce bias by chaining accurate local inferences through intermediate variables\u2014creating a measurable \u201creasoning gap\u201d between direct and step-by-step answers. This directly builds on empirical discoveries that eliciting intermediate steps improves performance (Nye et al. on scratchpads; Wei et al. on chain-of-thought; Kojima et al. showing zero-shot prompting suffices). Those works established the phenomenon but left open the causal mechanism. Wang et al.\u2019s self-consistency further suggested that exploring reasoning paths combats systematic errors, hinting at bias reduction properties that the present paper formalizes. Methodologically, the proof leverages autoregressive density estimation (Larochelle & Murray), whose conditional factorization makes explicit how local co-occurrences shape learned dependencies and where bias arises when variables are rarely co-observed. Conceptually, the account resonates with Pearl\u2019s graphical-model view: global relations can be inferred by composing local conditional links via intermediates, much like message passing. Finally, prompting strategies that decompose tasks (Zhou et al.\u2019s least-to-most) align with the paper\u2019s hypothesis that local subproblem solutions can be chained to reach non-local conclusions. Together, these works converge on a unified picture: intermediate reasoning is beneficial not because it adds information, but because, under realistic data locality and autoregressive modeling, it is the computational route that converts well-learned local structure into accurate global inference.",
