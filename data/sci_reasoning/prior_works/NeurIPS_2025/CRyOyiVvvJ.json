  "synthesis_narrative": "Scalable Fingerprinting of Large Language Models advances the backdoor-as-fingerprint line of work by reframing the goal as capacity: embedding tens of thousands of distinct, harmless, and persistent fingerprints without degrading utility. The conceptual and methodological backbone comes from backdoor watermarking (Adi et al., 2018) and the BadNets paradigm (Gu et al., 2017), which established that small, targeted perturbations can be implanted with minimal performance cost. In the NLP setting, universal trigger results (Wallace et al., 2019) provide concrete evidence that short token sequences can reliably steer model behavior, supporting the authors\u2019 design of compact textual fingerprints. Persistence through post-training\u2014central for practical fingerprint viability\u2014draws on findings that backdoors in pretrained LMs survive downstream fine-tuning (Kurita et al., 2020), a property the paper scales and systematizes.\nAt the systems and threat-model level, the work explicitly tackles fingerprint leakage and coalitions, invoking classical traitor-tracing principles. Boneh\u2013Shaw (1998) and Tardos (2003) formalize how to assign large numbers of user-specific codes and still identify colluders, shaping the paper\u2019s emphasis on scalability and robustness under coalition attacks. Finally, output watermarking for LLMs (Kirchenbauer et al., 2023) serves as a contrasting baseline that highlights the limitations of content-level marks under paraphrasing and distribution shift, motivating a move to model-embedded fingerprints with far higher capacity. Together, these threads coalesce into the paper\u2019s core innovation: a high-capacity, persistent, and utility-preserving fingerprinting scheme for LLMs via perinucleus-trigger design and large-scale deployment.",
