  "synthesis_narrative": "DCMHA\u2019s core idea\u2014breaking the independence of attention heads through input-dependent composition\u2014emerges directly from two lines of prior work: empirical analyses of head redundancy and architectural mechanisms that couple heads. Foundationally, Vaswani et al. (2017) established multi-head attention with independent heads, a design later scrutinized by Michel et al. (2019) and Voita et al. (2019), who showed many heads are redundant or prunable and that a few specialized heads dominate. These findings motivate replacing naive head parallelism with mechanisms that coordinate or consolidate head computation.\nTalking-Heads Attention (Shazeer et al., 2020) provided the first widely used cross-head communication, mixing logits and weights with learned static matrices. DCMHA extends this line by making composition input-dependent and operating on both score and weight matrices, enabling dynamic, context-specific head cooperation that can better capture complex patterns.\nA second thread concerns the rank and expressivity of attention. Linformer (Wang et al., 2020) argues attention is effectively low-rank and exploits this for efficiency, while Yun et al. (2020) analyze attention\u2019s expressive limits and how architectural choices affect capacity. DCMHA explicitly targets the low-rank bottleneck: by composing heads dynamically, it increases effective rank and expressivity without proportionally increasing compute.\nFinally, efficiency-driven head restructuring, exemplified by Grouped-Query Attention (Ainslie et al., 2023), shows modifying head independence can yield strong compute\u2013accuracy trade-offs. DCMHA aligns with this ethos, offering a drop-in MHA replacement that couples heads adaptively, improving perplexity and downstream performance at roughly constant parameters and compute.",
