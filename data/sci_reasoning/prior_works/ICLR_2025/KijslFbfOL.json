  "synthesis_narrative": "SIIHPC\u2019s core advances\u2014similarity-level imputation tied to a cross-view consensus graph and intra-view hybrid-group prototypes\u2014sit at the intersection of bipartite reconstruction, self-representation similarity learning, and multi-graph consensus principles. Anchor Graph Regularization established the practice of deriving dense sample\u2013sample affinities from a compact bipartite representation, a blueprint SIIHPC uses to convert partial bipartition signals (due to missing views) back into a standard similarity graph. Complementing this, self-representation\u2013based similarity learning showed that high-quality graphs can be learned via reconstruction with appropriate regularization rather than strict nonnegativity, motivating SIIHPC\u2019s relaxation of nonnegative constraints to better fit real data geometry.\n\nOn the multi-view side, AMGL formalized learning a consensus structure from multiple view-specific graphs, directly informing SIIHPC\u2019s mechanism that imputes missing similarities by coupling each view\u2019s exclusive similarity to a shared consensus graph. Classic IMVC methods such as PVC, DAIMC, and OPIMC exposed two key limitations SIIHPC addresses: (i) they often ignore missing samples or rely only on observed pairs, and (ii) they typically enforce a single shared set of prototypes/cluster indicators across all views. SIIHPC remedies (i) by operating at the similarity level to recover unobserved relations via consensus-guided imputation, and tackles (ii) by introducing hybrid prototype groups within each view, enabling flexible, view-specific representation capacity while still aligning through a learned consensus graph. Together, these strands yield a simple yet effective IMVC pipeline that unifies reconstruction-driven graph learning with principled cross-view consensus and richer per-view prototyping.",
