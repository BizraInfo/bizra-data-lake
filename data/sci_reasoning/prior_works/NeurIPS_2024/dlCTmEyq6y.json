  "synthesis_narrative": "This paper pinpoints a regime in high-dimensional sparse Gaussian classification where unlabeled data yields provable, algorithmic benefits for feature selection and classification. Two lines of prior work converge to enable this result. First, the SSL value literature\u2014Castelli and Cover\u2019s quantification of unlabeled data\u2019s benefit and Ben-David, Lu, and P\u00e1l\u2019s worst-case cautions\u2014frames the central question: when does structure make SSL genuinely helpful? Second, sparse Gaussian theory and support recovery provide the structural lens. Donoho and Jin\u2019s detection boundaries for sparse mixtures and Wainwright\u2019s Fano-style limits for support recovery furnish the information-theoretic tools to locate exact thresholds for identifying the sparse mean-difference support that drives classification.\n\nOn the algorithmic side, Cai and Liu\u2019s sparse LDA establishes efficient supervised baselines for sparse Gaussian classification, clarifying what is achievable without unlabeled data. The computational lower-bound methodology from Hopkins and Steurer, further formalized by Schramm and Wein, equips the authors to argue\u2014under the low-degree likelihood hardness conjecture\u2014that any efficient supervised method fails in parts of the parameter space where a polynomial-time semi-supervised procedure succeeds. Together, these works enable a sharp statistical\u2013computational phase diagram: unlabeled data improves covariance/structure estimation enough to cross the detectability and support-recovery thresholds with polynomial-time algorithms, while supervised efficient methods remain stuck below them. The result is a rigorous, model-specific demonstration of the provable advantage of unlabeled data in sparse Gaussian classification.",
