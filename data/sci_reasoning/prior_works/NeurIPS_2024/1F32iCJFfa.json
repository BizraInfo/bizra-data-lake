  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014a single-flow discretization to compute Schr\u00f6dinger bridges (SB) for unpaired data translation without repeatedly training diffusion-like models\u2014sits at the intersection of dynamic optimal transport (OT), entropic regularization, and score/flow-based generative modeling. The dynamic OT viewpoint of Benamou and Brenier established transport as a time-dependent flow minimizing kinetic energy, which directly motivates constructing transport maps as velocity fields. Entropic OT, popularized computationally by Cuturi\u2019s Sinkhorn approach, and its rigorous connection to SB synthesized in L\u00e9onard\u2019s survey, shift this dynamic view to the entropy-regularized regime where SB is the target object. Iterative Bregman projection methods (Benamou\u2013Carlier\u2013Cuturi\u2013Nenna\u2013Peyr\u00e9) provided scalable static/dynamic entropic OT solvers, yet their reliance on batch couplings or discretized projections is challenging in high dimensions. On the generative modeling side, score-based diffusion via SDEs (Song et al.) supplied practical tools to learn probability flows from data; leveraging these, the Diffusion Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge (De Bortoli et al., 2021) made SB computation feasible but at the cost of alternately retraining score/velocity fields across iterations. The present work unifies these lines by deriving and discretizing a principled flow whose fixed point is the SB, thereby inheriting the desirable properties of OT/SB while sidestepping repeated DDM-style trainings and the inaccuracies of mini-batch entropic OT. In doing so, it preserves the theoretical fidelity of dynamic entropic transport and the scalability of modern flow/diffusion learning, tailored to unpaired translation tasks.",
