  "synthesis_narrative": "Image-to-Sphere Policy (ISP) fuses two lines of prior work: diffusion-based visuomotor policies and group-equivariant neural representations. Diffusion Policy introduced action diffusion as a powerful generative framework for visuomotor control, but it lacked explicit handling of 3D rotational symmetries, limiting data efficiency. Concurrently, a rich literature on equivariant deep learning\u2014beginning with Group Equivariant CNNs and extended by Spherical CNNs and Gauge Equivariant CNNs\u2014showed that embedding symmetry constraints into model architectures can drastically reduce sample complexity. On the 3D side, Tensor Field Networks and SE(3)-Transformers demonstrated the effectiveness of strict SO(3)/SE(3) equivariance for geometric reasoning, while Equivariant Diffusion models proved that marrying diffusion with symmetry constraints yields practical gains in generative tasks.\n\nISP\u2019s key insight is to project eye-in-hand RGB image features onto a spherical domain, enabling SO(3)-equivariant processing without reconstructing point clouds\u2014a departure from earlier equivariant visuomotor approaches that relied on multi-camera point clouds fixed in the workspace. By enforcing rotational symmetry in the spherical feature space, ISP preserves the compelling benefits of equivariance (robustness, generalization, and sample efficiency) while aligning with modern single-camera, eye-in-hand setups. In doing so, it integrates diffusion policy training with principled SO(3) symmetry handling, operationalized through spherical representations and equivariant operators. This synthesis directly extends the successes of equivariant networks and equivariant diffusion to a practical, camera-first manipulation setting, delivering consistent improvements over strong baselines in both simulation and real-world experiments.",
