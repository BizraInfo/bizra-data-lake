  "synthesis_narrative": "FactoST\u2019s central idea\u2014factorizing spatio-temporal foundation modeling by decoupling universal temporal pretraining from spatial adaptation\u2014sits at the intersection of three influential lines of work. First, Autoformer introduced decomposition/autocorrelation mechanisms that make temporal regularities (trend/seasonality) explicit, directly motivating FactoST\u2019s multi-frequency reconstruction objective to capture cross-domain time patterns in a space-agnostic backbone. Complementarily, Informer\u2019s ProbSparse attention and Graph WaveNet\u2019s adaptive adjacency both argue for parsimony: retain only the most salient interactions. FactoST operationalizes this in its spatial adapter, which fuses metadata while learning sparse cross-node links, achieving both efficiency and robustness.\nSecond, parameter-efficient transfer catalyzed by adapter tuning (Houlsby et al.) and its video counterpart ST-Adapter demonstrated that large, frozen backbones can be specialized to new modalities or tasks via small plug-in modules. FactoST adopts this recipe verbatim: freeze or lightly finetune a universal temporal core and attach a lightweight spatial adapter that injects domain and topology awareness without bloating parameters.\nThird, adaptation signals are injected through prompts and stabilized over shifts with rehearsal. Prefix-tuning provides the tooling for domain-aware prompting during temporal pretraining, while iCaRL\u2019s memory replay informs FactoST\u2019s continual replay to maintain alignment across evolving domains. Finally, PatchTST\u2019s strong results with a purely temporal Transformer reinforce the paper\u2019s thesis that temporal structure can be learned independently of spatial correlations, enabling the proposed factorization. Together, these works directly scaffold FactoST\u2019s design choices in objective, architecture, efficiency, and adaptation.",
