  "synthesis_narrative": "TarFlow\u2019s core innovation sits at the intersection of autoregressive flows and Transformer-based sequence modeling for images. The architectural backbone directly extends Masked Autoregressive Flow (Papamakarios et al., 2017), but replaces MAF\u2019s masked MLP conditioners with autoregressive Transformer blocks. This swap crucially preserves MADE\u2019s (Germain et al., 2015) masked autoregressive factorization while leveraging self-attention to capture long-range dependencies. In line with Neural Autoregressive Flows (Huang et al., 2018), TarFlow stacks multiple autoregressive transforms and alternates the ordering/direction across layers to boost expressivity\u2014now executed over image patches with attention rather than NADE/MADE networks. The decision to use self-attention over images is motivated by the Image Transformer (Parmar et al., 2018), which established that autoregressive Transformers scale effectively for image generation; TarFlow internalizes this within an invertible, likelihood-based model. Methodologically, the work targets shortcomings of prior image flows such as Glow (Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018) and Flow++ (Ho et al., 2019): despite exact likelihoods, their coupling-based designs and dequantization strategies left a persistent gap in perceptual quality. TarFlow addresses this with a more expressive autoregressive flow plus training-and-sampling refinements\u2014Gaussian noise augmentation and a post-training denoising step that substitutes for heavier dequantization machinery. Finally, its sampling guidance mechanism is inspired by classifier-free diffusion guidance (Ho & Salimans, 2021), extending the conditional\u2013unconditional interpolation idea to flows to reliably steer both class-conditional and unconditional generation.",
