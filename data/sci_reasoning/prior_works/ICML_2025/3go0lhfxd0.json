  "synthesis_narrative": "This paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014a theory-backed account of how RNNs undergo a phase transition to an algorithmic solution on streaming parity\u2014sits at the confluence of three lines of work. First, foundational studies on sequence modeling with RNNs (Elman) and learning/extracting finite-state automata (Giles et al.) established that recurrent networks can compress sequential regularities into compact internal states, with later formal work (Weiss et al.) tying simple RNNs to finite-state behavior under finite precision. These works ground parity as an automaton-like computation that, once internalized, should extrapolate to arbitrarily long sequences.\nSecond, the paper builds on a modern body of evidence that neural nets can discover discrete algorithms with length generalization (Kaiser & Sutskever), culminating in the grokking phenomenon (Power et al.), where networks abruptly shift from memorization to systemic generalization on algorithmic tasks. Mechanistic analyses of grokking (Nanda et al.) further suggested that this shift reflects specific representational reorganizations rather than mere training time effects.\nThird, the authors leverage theoretical insights from learning dynamics (Saxe et al.) that describe stagewise representation formation and mode interactions. Extending this perspective to nonlinear RNNs on parity, the paper proposes an effective theory explaining a representational merger\u2014an internal collapse to the even/odd parity state\u2014that triggers a sharp transition to perfect, infinite generalization. Together, these strands directly inform the paper\u2019s conceptualization, methodology, and interpretation of the observed phase transition as algorithm development in RNNs.",
