  "synthesis_narrative": "SAFE\u2019s core innovation\u2014explicitly finding subnetworks that are both sparse and flat via a sparsity-constrained, flatness-aware objective\u2014arises from fusing two lines of prior work. From the generalization literature, SAM introduced a practical min\u2013max objective that drives optimization toward flat minima; this provides the precise flatness objective that SAFE embeds in pruning. The need to target flat minima in the first place is grounded in the sharpness\u2013generalization link identified by Keskar et al., which explains why conventional pruning often incurs accuracy drops. From the compression side, the Learning\u2013Compression framework pioneered formulating network compression as constrained optimization solved with Lagrangian methods and projection operators; SAFE directly extends this paradigm by using an augmented Lagrange dual approach to enforce hard sparsity while simultaneously optimizing the SAM-style objective. Against widely used baselines\u2014magnitude pruning and Movement Pruning\u2014SAFE replaces heuristic or task-specific sparsification with a principled constrained solver that balances sparsity and flatness, yielding better generalization and robustness. L0 regularization further contextualizes SAFE\u2019s design choices: while L0 methods provide explicit sparsity control, they do not explicitly encourage flatness nor solve a hard-constraint problem with dual variables and generalized projections. Finally, the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis motivates the subnetwork-seeking goal; SAFE operationalizes it by explicitly steering the search toward flat sparse minima, addressing the observed performance degradation in prior pruning pipelines.",
