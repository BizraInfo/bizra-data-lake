  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core insight\u2014repurposing large pretrained language/vision Transformers for general time-series analysis by freezing their residual self-attention/FFN blocks and learning small interfaces\u2014draws most directly from the Frozen Pretrained Transformer paradigm of Lu et al., which showed that a fixed Transformer can be retargeted by training only input/output mappings. This freeze-and-adapt philosophy is reinforced by parameter-efficient transfer methods such as adapter tuning (Houlsby et al.) and prefix-tuning (Li & Liang), which empirically validated that high-capacity backbones can remain untouched while small parameter sets enable effective specialization. Large-scale pretraining results from GPT-3 (Brown et al.) motivate the use of LMs as universal feature extractors to mitigate time-series data scarcity. On the vision side, ViT (Dosovitskiy et al.) established patch-based tokenization and provided robust image-pretrained Transformer backbones; AST (Gong et al.) offered a salient cross-modal example by adapting ViT to audio via spectrogram patching, demonstrating that minimal interfaces can bridge modalities. Finally, prior Transformer formulations for time series (Zerveas et al.) informed how to tokenize multivariate sequences and apply positional encodings so that time-series inputs are compatible with pretrained Transformer stacks. Together, these works converge on a simple but powerful recipe: keep the pretrained Transformer blocks frozen, design lightweight input/output interfaces tailored to time-series structure, and fine-tune for diverse tasks (forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, few-shot), yielding a single model that \u201cfits all.\u201d",
