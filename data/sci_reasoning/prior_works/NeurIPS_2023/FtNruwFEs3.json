  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014exact Bayesian inference for discrete probabilistic programs (even with infinite supports and continuous priors) via probability generating functions (PGFs) and automatic differentiation\u2014sits at the confluence of exact PPL inference, generating-function analysis, and AD. Prior systems like PSI and DICE established that exact, fully automated inference is feasible for discrete probabilistic programs by compiling programs into algebraic representations and applying symbolic manipulation. The present work adopts that ethos but replaces bespoke computer-algebra pipelines with PGFs as a uniform, closed-form representation of program-defined distributions, enabling direct computation of posteriors and higher moments by differentiation.\nAnalytic combinatorics provides the mathematical backbone: generating functions encode compositional structure (sums, products, branching), and derivatives recover probabilities and moments. This perspective dovetails with probabilistic program semantics from pGCL/expectation transformers, ensuring that the PGF calculus corresponds to exact quantitative semantics (probabilities, expectations, variances). On the hybrid side, Weighted Model Integration demonstrated exact inference with continuous priors over discrete/Boolean structure; the PGF approach advances this by supporting many infinite-support models and leveraging AD-driven Taylor polynomials rather than piecewise symbolic integration. Finally, automatic differentiation theory operationalizes the method, allowing Genfer to extract Taylor coefficients and factorial moments efficiently without general-purpose computer algebra. Together, these strands crystallize into a new, implementable pipeline\u2014PGFs + AD\u2014that generalizes prior exact PPL inference to broader discrete models with rigorous correctness and strong empirical performance.",
