  "synthesis_narrative": "LODGE\u2019s core contribution\u2014an explicit, hierarchical level-of-detail pipeline for 3D Gaussian Splatting with pruning and streaming\u2014stands on two converging lines of prior work: point-based LOD and multiscale neural rendering. The foundational basis is Kerbl et al.\u2019s 3D Gaussian Splatting, which supplies the differentiable splat primitive and optimization framework that LODGE reorganizes across levels. Classic point-based rendering (QSplat, Surfels) contributes the key ideas of distance-aware hierarchical selection, pruning low-importance elements, and opacity-respecting blending to avoid popping\u2014principles LODGE adapts to the Gaussian domain via importance-based pruning and boundary-safe opacity blending. From neural radiance field acceleration, PlenOctrees shows how hierarchical, pruned structures preserve quality while enabling real-time traversal, directly informing LODGE\u2019s multi-level construction and culling. For scaling to city-sized scenes under tight memory, Mega-NeRF\u2019s spatial partitioning and streaming inspire LODGE\u2019s chunking and dynamic loading strategy. Finally, the anti-aliasing lineage (Mip-NeRF and Zip-NeRF) motivates LODGE\u2019s depth-aware smoothing and level construction to maintain fidelity when reducing detail with distance. Synthesizing these threads, LODGE integrates Gaussian-native LOD selection with prefiltered level generation, aggressive yet quality-preserving pruning, and streaming-aware chunk management to deliver real-time, memory-efficient rendering of large scenes without sacrificing visual quality.",
