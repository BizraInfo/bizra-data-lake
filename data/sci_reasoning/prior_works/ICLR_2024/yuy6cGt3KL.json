  "synthesis_narrative": "Orthogonal learning for treatment effects established a computable surrogate risk: Nie and Wager\u2019s R-loss provides an objective that depends only on observed outcomes and nuisance functions, enabling out-of-sample scoring of CATE models. Athey and Imbens earlier introduced the transformed outcome idea, turning observed data and propensities into a proxy label for treatment effect, which underlies tau-risk style factual-only selection. In parallel, off-policy evaluation advanced practical value-based surrogates: Dud\u00edk, Langford, and Li\u2019s IPS/DR estimators estimate counterfactual policy value from observational data, furnishing natural criteria to rank CATE models via induced treat-versus-not-treat decisions. Uplift modeling supplied operational evaluation curves\u2014Radcliffe and Surry\u2019s Qini/AUUC\u2014that summarize incremental impact and are often used to choose among uplift/CATE models. On the modeling side, K\u00fcnzel et al. unified the S-/T-/X-learner meta-frameworks that produce a diverse set of CATE predictors among which selection is necessary. Finally, Chernozhukov et al.\u2019s orthogonalization and cross-fitting formalized robust nuisance estimation, directly supporting both R-loss and DR-style selection metrics. Together these strands yielded multiple, competing surrogate selection criteria\u2014orthogonal risk, transformed-outcome risk, uplift curves, and policy-value estimators\u2014yet with limited head-to-head evaluation and unclear sensitivity to nuisance and tuning. The current work naturally synthesizes this landscape by benchmarking these specific surrogates across prominent CATE learners, systematically tuning their nuisance/hyperparameters (guided by orthogonalization principles), and augmenting evaluation with more realistic generative data\u2014thereby revealing when each surrogate best aligns with true CATE accuracy and proposing improved model-selection strategies.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of model selection in causal inference, specifically for conditional average treatment effect (CATE) estimation. Unlike machine learning, there is no perfect analogue of cross-validation for model selection as we do not observe the counterfactual potential outcomes. Towards this, a variety of surrogate metrics have been proposed for CATE model selection that use only observed data. However, we do not have a good understanding regarding their effectiveness due to limited comparisons in prior studies. We conduct an extensive empirical analysis to benchmark the surrogate model selection metrics introduced in the literature, as well as the novel ones introduced in this work. We ensure a fair comparison by tuning the hyperparameters associated with these metrics via AutoML, and provide more detailed trends by incorporating realistic datasets via generative modeling. Our analysis suggests novel model selection strategies based on careful hyperparameter selection of CATE ",
