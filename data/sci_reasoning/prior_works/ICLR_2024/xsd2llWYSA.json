  "synthesis_narrative": "Rhythmic dynamic movement primitives established that periodic motions can be encoded with a phase-driven dynamical system, but relied on hand-crafted bases that do not capture rich spatial\u2013temporal coupling. Probabilistic Movement Primitives extended this line with distributions over trajectories, enabling variability and interpolation, though expressivity and scalability to complex periodic/quasi-periodic behaviors remained limited. Phase-Functioned Neural Networks showed that conditioning on a continuous phase variable can drive high-fidelity locomotion controllers, highlighting phase as a powerful motion coordinate. In physics-based character control, DeepMimic demonstrated robust RL tracking from motion clips, while its clip-centric design struggled when reference coverage is sparse. Adversarial Motion Priors improved generalization via learned motion priors, yet lacked explicit temporal structure to guarantee coherent interpolation across styles and frequencies. Parallel advances in Koopman autoencoders revealed that nonlinear dynamics can be encoded into latent spaces with simple, often linear evolution, and SIREN showed that sinusoidal parameterizations are especially effective for representing periodic signals. Together, these works point to a gap: controllers need an explicit, low-dimensional, temporally structured latent that both respects periodic/quasi-periodic dynamics and supports interpolation under sparse data. The natural synthesis is to learn a Koopman-inspired latent where dynamics are constrained to harmonic/Fourier evolution, using sinusoidal structure to encode spatial\u2013temporal relations while providing a continuous parameterization for control. This yields a motion model that bridges PFNN-style phase conditioning with DeepMimic/AMP tracking, enabling robust online tracking and generalization to unseen targets from limited demonstrations.",

    "abstract": "Motion trajectories offer reliable references for physics-based motion learning but suffer from sparsity, particularly in regions that lack sufficient data coverage. To address this challenge, we introduce a self-supervised, structured representation and generation method that extracts spatial-temporal relationships in periodic or quasi-periodic motions. The motion dynamics in a continuously parameterized latent space enable our method to enhance the interpolation and generalization capabilities of motion learning algorithms. The motion learning controller, informed by the motion parameterization, operates online tracking of a wide range of motions, including targets unseen during training. With a fallback mechanism, the controller dynamically adapts its tracking strategy and automatically resorts to safe action execution when a potentially risky target is proposed. By leveraging the identified spatial-temporal structure, our work opens new possibilities for future advancements in gene",
