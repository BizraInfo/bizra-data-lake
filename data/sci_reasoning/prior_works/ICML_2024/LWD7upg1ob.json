  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014Aug-PE for differentially private synthetic text via LLM APIs\u2014sits at the intersection of black-box evolutionary generation and rigorous DP selection/accounting. It builds directly on Private Evolution (Lin et al., 2024), which introduced a DP propose\u2013score\u2013select loop using only API access to foundation models; Aug-PE adapts this template from images to the harder text domain by defining text-specific utilities, augmentations, and iteration schemes. The selection step is grounded in the exponential mechanism (McSherry & Talwar, 2007), enabling private best-of-N choice among LLM samples based on utilities computed against sensitive corpora. Because Aug-PE repeats private scoring/selection many times, it relies on tight composition\u2014conveniently handled by R\u00e9nyi Differential Privacy (Mironov, 2017)\u2014to maintain end-to-end guarantees. The black-box optimization flavor of Aug-PE echoes evolution strategies (Salimans et al., 2017), which inspire the generate\u2013mutate\u2013select procedure without accessing model internals. On the generative privacy side, PATE (Papernot et al., 2017) and PATE-GAN (Jordon et al., 2019) established that noisy aggregation/selection can safely guide model outputs, a principle Aug-PE applies to rerank LLM candidates using DP noise. Finally, Abadi et al. (2016) provide the canonical DP-SGD baseline and conceptual backdrop\u2014highlighting the cost and impracticality of DP fine-tuning proprietary LLMs that Aug-PE circumvents while still delivering formal DP guarantees for synthetic text.",
