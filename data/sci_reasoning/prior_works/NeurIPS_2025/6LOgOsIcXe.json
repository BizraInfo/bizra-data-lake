  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper targets a long-standing asymmetry in PAC learning: ERM is optimal in the agnostic case but provably suboptimal in the realizable case. Foundationally, Kearns\u2013Schapire\u2013Sellie framed agnostic PAC learning and, together with classical VC theory, established the 1/\u221am excess-risk landscape where ERM is optimal. In contrast, optimal realizable rates and the explicit suboptimality of ERM, clarified by Hanneke and exemplified algorithmically by the one-inclusion graph method of Haussler\u2013Littlestone\u2013Warmuth, reveal that distributions with very small Bayes-in-class error (\u03c4\u22480) are effectively \"easier.\"\n\nHanneke\u2013Larsen\u2013Zhivotovskiy (FOCS \u201924) directly addressed this mismatch by parameterizing agnostic error in terms of \u03c4, proving \u03c4-sensitive lower bounds. The present paper advances precisely along this front, seeking tight upper bounds/algorithms that match those lower bounds and delineating when agnostic learners should incur only \u03c4-weighted excess error, thereby harmonizing the realizable and agnostic regimes within a single framework.\n\nTechnically, the work draws on variance-sensitive analysis traditions. Local Rademacher complexity theory shows that effective rates improve when excess risk (and thus variance) is small, while empirical Bernstein inequalities make this dependence explicit in concentration terms. Although fast-rate results under explicit low-noise conditions (Massart\u2013N\u00e9d\u00e9lec) require assumptions, they conceptually foreshadow how intrinsic noise parameters govern achievable rates. By combining \u03c4-aware lower-bound insights from Hanneke\u2013Larsen\u2013Zhivotovskiy with variance/localization techniques, the paper delivers principled \u03c4-dependent agnostic guarantees and clarifies ERM\u2019s limitations and possibilities in the small-error regime.",
