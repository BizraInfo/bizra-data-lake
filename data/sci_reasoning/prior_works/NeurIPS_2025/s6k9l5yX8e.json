  "synthesis_narrative": "Dynam3D\u2019s core contribution\u2014dynamic, layered, language-aligned 3D tokens as the visual interface for a navigation policy\u2014emerges at the intersection of VLN, open-vocabulary semantics, 2D-to-3D lifting, and embodied mapping/memory. The R2R benchmark formalized instruction-conditioned navigation, while VLN-BERT showed that stronger cross-modal alignment substantially improves instruction following; Dynam3D keeps this alignment but replaces 2D inputs with structured 3D tokens that directly encode geometry and spatial semantics. CLIP provides the language-aligned visual features that Dynam3D projects into 3D, enabling open-vocabulary reasoning about objects and places referenced in natural language. The lift-and-project paradigm of Lift, Splat, Shoot underpins Dynam3D\u2019s method for aggregating posed RGB-D features into a coherent 3D space, which is then organized hierarchically to support different spatial scales and action horizons. To address exploration and long-term memory, Dynam3D echoes insights from Active Neural SLAM by using its layered 3D tokens as a compact, persistent spatial memory consumable by a policy model. The system\u2019s explicit attention to dynamic scenes is influenced by DynaSLAM\u2019s separation of static structure from moving elements, guiding token updates and robustness. Finally, recent Video-VLMs like Video-LLaMA motivate the shift: while they generalize well, their 2D temporal inputs lack grounded 3D geometry and scalable memory\u2014gaps Dynam3D fills by feeding a 3D, language-aligned, hierarchical representation into a VLM for action prediction.",
