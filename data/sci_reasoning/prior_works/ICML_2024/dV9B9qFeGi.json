  "synthesis_narrative": "M3G\u2019s core innovation is to replace pairwise or pooled multi-view contrastive objectives with a single joint objective that couples all k views using multi-marginal optimal transport (MM-OT). The contrastive lineage begins with CPC (van den Oord et al., 2018), which introduced the InfoNCE formulation that virtually all paired-view methods adopt. In multi-view contexts, CMC (Tian et al., 2019) operationalizes this by summing the k(k\u22121)/2 pairwise InfoNCE terms, while MIL-NCE (Miech et al., 2020) typifies the one-vs-average-of-rest family by aggregating positives into a bag. These extensions, however, inherently neglect the joint structure across all k views. M3G directly targets this gap by contrasting the cost of the ground-truth k-tuples with an MM-OT polymatching cost that forms optimally rearranged k-tuples within the batch. This leap is enabled by the MM-OT foundation: Agueh and Carlier (2011) provided the multi-marginal coupling and barycentric formulations needed to reason about k-way joint structures, while Benamou et al. (2015) introduced entropic regularization and iterative Bregman projections (generalized Sinkhorn) that make MM-OT differentiable and numerically stable. Crucially, the computational bottleneck of MM-OT is addressed by low-rank Sinkhorn factorization (Scetbon et al., 2021), which M3G leverages to avoid O(n^k) complexity when forming polymatchings across n\u00d7k embeddings. Together, these works directly shape M3G\u2019s loss design and its practical scalability.",
