  "synthesis_narrative": "LABridge builds on the diffusion modeling core of DDPM and the SDE view of score-based generative modeling, where the variance-preserving SDE naturally corresponds to an Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck (OU) process. These works establish both the training objective and the stochastic calculus that LABridge leverages to introduce a novel mean-conditioned OU trajectory. Operating in a compact latent space follows Latent Diffusion Models, which demonstrated that moving generation from pixel space to an autoencoder\u2019s latent space yields efficiency without sacrificing fidelity. However, LDM\u2019s cross-attention alone can leave text\u2013image semantics underconstrained.\nCLIP and DALL\u00b7E 2 directly motivate LABridge\u2019s Text\u2013Image Alignment Encoder (TIAE). CLIP showed that text and images can inhabit a shared, semantically coherent space, while DALL\u00b7E 2\u2019s diffusion prior maps text embeddings to image-aligned embedding distributions. LABridge advances this idea by learning a text-conditioned prior aligned specifically to the image diffusion latents and embedding it into the generative path itself. Conceptually, the system is informed by Schr\u00f6dinger bridge formulations, which model stochastic bridges between given marginals. LABridge embodies this by conditioning the OU mean to smoothly transport from the text prior to the image latent manifold, reducing semantic drift and enabling fewer denoising steps through a more directed trajectory. Finally, insights from classifier-free guidance about the alignment\u2013diversity tradeoff motivate replacing ever-stronger guidance with principled latent alignment and controlled dynamics. Together, these threads yield LABridge\u2019s core contribution: a text\u2013image aligned latent prior coupled with a mean-conditioned OU bridge for stable, efficient text-to-image synthesis.",
