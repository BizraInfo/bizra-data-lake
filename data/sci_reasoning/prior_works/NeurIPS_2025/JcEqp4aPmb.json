  "synthesis_narrative": "InfinityStar\u2019s core contribution\u2014a unified spacetime autoregressive framework that models both images and videos as a single discrete sequence\u2014emerges from two converging lines of work: discrete tokenization for high-fidelity visual synthesis and transformer-based autoregression for scalable generation. VQ-VAE established the possibility of compressing visual content into discrete codebooks, while VQGAN demonstrated that perceptually aligned quantized latents can carry enough detail to support high-resolution synthesis. Building on this discrete substrate, ImageGPT showed that transformers can effectively model visual sequences autoregressively, and DALL\u00b7E extended the recipe to text-conditioned generation over quantized image tokens, cementing the language-modeling paradigm for vision.\n\nFor the temporal dimension, Scalable Autoregressive Video Generation Using Transformers explored causal spatiotemporal attention over tokenized videos, introducing the mechanism InfinityStar leverages to extend sequences over time for long-duration outputs. Finally, NUWA framed a single architecture that spans images and videos via discrete tokens, informing InfinityStar\u2019s unified design that supports text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video, and video continuation within one model. By fusing these ideas\u2014perceptually strong discrete tokenizers, AR transformers for visual tokens, text conditioning, and temporal causal modeling\u2014InfinityStar delivers fast, high-resolution, and long-form video generation in a purely discrete AR pipeline, outperforming prior AR systems and rivaling diffusion methods while simplifying the architecture across tasks.",
