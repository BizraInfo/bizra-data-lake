  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014diversity-driven, directed weight adjustment during synthesis\u2014sits squarely within the bilevel dataset distillation lineage introduced by Dataset Distillation, while directly addressing a persistent weakness: synthetic instance redundancy. Gradient Matching (Zhao et al.) established practical, parallelizable instance-wise synthesis but often yields overlapping gradients across synthetic samples; the new method augments this objective with dynamic per-instance weights that decorrelate updates, preserving parallelism while mitigating redundancy. Prior attempts to improve diversity largely relied on augmentations (DSA) or tightly coupled set-level objectives (Distribution Matching), which improve coverage but either depend on heavy augmentations or complicate parallel synthesis. By contrast, the proposed approach internalizes diversity into the optimization via learned weighting, achieving set-level coverage with isolated, scalable instance updates.\nTrajectory Matching (MTT) highlighted the importance of aligning training dynamics; the present work echoes this by directing weights across synthesis steps so each instance acquires complementary signal rather than duplicating peers. KIP\u2019s inducing-point perspective underscores the need for manifold coverage; directed weighting effectively operationalizes this notion under neural training by pushing instances toward distinct, representative regions. Finally, meta-learning based reweighting (Ren et al.) provides the methodological precedent for dynamic example weighting; repurposed here for the synthesis stage, it supplies the mechanism to adjust contributions on-the-fly according to diversity/representativeness criteria. Together, these works converge on the insight that controlling how each synthetic instance influences optimization is key to scalable, diverse dataset distillation.",
