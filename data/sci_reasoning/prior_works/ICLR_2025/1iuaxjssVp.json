  "synthesis_narrative": "InvMSAFold fuses two historically separate lines of work: MSA-based Potts modeling of protein sequence landscapes and structure-conditioned inverse folding. The DCA framework (Morcos et al.) and its practical pseudolikelihood inference (Ekeberg et al.) established the pairwise Markov random field with fields and couplings as a faithful model of coevolutionary constraints. EVmutation (Hopf et al.) further showed that these Potts energies capture epistasis relevant to function and that sampling from them yields plausible variant repertoires, clarifying the utility of a distributional, pairwise model for design. In parallel, DeepSequence and EVE demonstrated that generative models trained on MSAs provide strong priors over sequences but are bottlenecked by the need for deep alignments and are slow to deploy for novel folds\u2014precisely the limitations InvMSAFold targets by predicting MSA-like pairwise statistics directly from structure. The inverse folding literature (Ingraham et al.; ProteinMPNN) defined effective structure-to-sequence learning but largely outputs per-position probabilities and samples sequences autoregressively, which hampers diversity and speed. InvMSAFold synthesizes these strands by using structural input to generate Potts parameters that mimic MSA covariances, enabling immediate, parallel sampling of highly diverse sequences while preserving structural and functional constraints. In effect, it replaces the MSA with structure as the source of epistatic signal and replaces autoregressive decoding with fast sampling from a learned pairwise distribution.",
