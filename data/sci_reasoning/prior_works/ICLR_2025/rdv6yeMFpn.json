  "synthesis_narrative": "Xu et al. established that message-passing GNNs are bounded by 1-WL, motivating expressivity analyses in terms of structures these networks can or cannot distinguish. Morris et al. connected higher-order GNNs to k-WL and substructure counting, crystallizing a homomorphism-counting perspective for expressivity: certain architectures are exactly characterized by the graph templates whose homomorphisms they can count. Maron et al. demonstrated that invariant/equivariant architectures can implement explicit homomorphism polynomials, making homomorphism counts a constructive tool rather than just a characterization. Keriven and Peyr\u00e9 showed invariant graph functions arise as polynomial functions of adjacency/Laplacian, tying invariance to traces and spectral moments that encode structured walk counts. Barcel\u00f3 et al. formalized the logical limits of MPNNs in C2, highlighting their inability to count many subgraphs and calling for principled ways to surpass these limits. Finally, Brouwer and Haemers provided the spectral moment equalities linking eigenvalue power sums to closed-walk counts, the key algebraic identities connecting spectra to combinatorial counts.\nBringing these threads together, a natural opportunity emerges: use the polynomial/spectral viewpoint to translate spectral invariants into precise homomorphism-counting capabilities and quantify how this extends WL-bounded MPNNs. By leveraging spectral moment identities within the homomorphism-count framework pioneered for higher-order and invariant networks, the paper pinpoints a concrete, exactly-countable family\u2014parallel trees\u2014and derives a hierarchy across spectral-invariant architectural variants and depths. This synthesis turns the abstract promise of spectra into a rigorous, quantitative expressivity statement about what subgraphs spectral-invariant GNNs can exactly count.",

    "abstract": "Graph spectra are an important class of structural features on graphs that have shown promising results in enhancing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Despite their widespread practical use, the theoretical understanding of the power of spectral invariants --- particularly their contribution to GNNs --- remains incomplete. In this paper, we address this fundamental question through the lens of homomorphism expressivity, providing a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of the expressive power of spectral invariants. Specifically, we prove that spectral invariant GNNs can homomorphism-count exactly a class of specific tree-like graphs which we refer to as \\emph{parallel trees}. We highlight the significance of this result in various contexts, including establishing a quantitative expressiveness hierarchy across different architectural variants, offering insights into the impact of GNN depth, and understanding the subgraph counting capabilities of spectral invariant GNNs.
