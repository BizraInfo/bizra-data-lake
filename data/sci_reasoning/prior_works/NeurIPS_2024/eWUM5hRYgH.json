  "synthesis_narrative": "This paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014finite-sample statistical efficiency guarantees for distributional temporal-difference (TD) learning via a non-parametric distributional TD (NTD)\u2014builds by unifying foundational distributional RL theory with modern finite-time TD analysis. The distributional viewpoint of Bellemare, Dabney, and Munos established the object of interest (the return distribution), the distributional Bellman operator, and appropriate probability metrics, which anchor the problem formulation and stability considerations. Rowland and colleagues\u2019 analysis of categorical distributional RL formalized projection-based distributional updates (CTD) and proved their asymptotic convergence under the Cram\u00e9r metric, while subsequent work proved asymptotic convergence of quantile temporal-difference learning (QTD). These two asymptotic results define the principal distributional TD instances and serve as the immediate baselines the present work advances beyond by providing non-asymptotic performance guarantees.\n\nTo move from asymptotics to finite-sample guarantees, the paper draws on techniques from the finite-time analysis of classic TD. In particular, the stochastic approximation frameworks and mixing-time\u2013dependent bounds developed by Bhandari\u2013Russo\u2013Singal and by Srikant\u2013Ying provide the proof machinery for controlling bias\u2013variance tradeoffs, step-size schedules, and the accumulation of noise along Markovian trajectories. By proposing a non-parametric distributional TD iterate, the authors sidestep approximation artifacts inherent to categorical or quantile projections while retaining TD-style bootstrapping. This synthesis enables sharp, finite-sample bounds for distributional policy evaluation, positioning NTD\u2019s rates relative to the established CTD/QTD schemes and clarifying the statistical efficiency landscape of distributional TD.",
