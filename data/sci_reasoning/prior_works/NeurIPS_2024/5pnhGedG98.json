  "synthesis_narrative": "ArithTreeRL\u2019s core idea\u2014casting adder and multiplier synthesis as a single-player tree-generation game solved by reinforcement learning\u2014stands on two pillars: the arithmetic tree design canon and modern RL-guided search in combinatorial spaces. On the arithmetic side, Wallace and Dadda established compressor-tree multipliers and principled reduction scheduling, defining the key levers (layering and compression factors) that govern delay and area. For adders, Kogge\u2013Stone and Brent\u2013Kung represent canonical extremes on the speed\u2013area Pareto frontier, while Ladner\u2013Fischer provided a unifying framework for constructing and reasoning about prefix networks. Together, these works demarcate a rich but discrete design manifold of tree topologies and layer organizations.\n\nOn the search/methodology side, AlphaZero demonstrated how learned policy/value models can guide tree exploration to solve intractably large decision spaces, and AlphaTensor showed that RL can rediscover and surpass hand-designed arithmetic procedures with real performance gains. ArithTreeRL fuses these threads: it parameterizes the historically motivated design space of arithmetic trees (prefix and compressor layers) and applies RL to navigate choices of grouping, fanout, and reduction schedules, effectively learning when to emulate Kogge\u2013Stone-like parallelism, Brent\u2013Kung-like parsimony, or Dadda-style staged compression\u2014and when to innovate beyond them. This synthesis yields hardware-aware designs that improve latency and area within hours, demonstrating that the marriage of classical arithmetic-structure theory with RL-driven tree search can advance the state of the art in adder and multiplier synthesis.",
