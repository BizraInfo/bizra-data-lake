  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014a unified fixed-point perspective on conditional guidance culminating in Foresight Guidance (FSG)\u2014builds on two strands: guidance mechanisms and diffusion sampling theory. First, classifier-based guidance (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021) and classifier-free guidance (Ho & Salimans, 2021) established that conditioning can be injected by altering scores, but they operated as single-step, short-interval updates and exhibit inefficiency/instability at high guidance scales. Latent Diffusion Models (Rombach et al., 2022) entrenched CFG as the de facto text-to-image mechanism, making clearer the practical limitations the present work targets.\nSecond, advances in sampling illuminate how to allocate computation over the diffusion trajectory. DDIM (Song et al., 2020) showed deterministic, longer-interval transitions can preserve fidelity, suggesting that longer subproblems are tractable. Score-based SDE work (Song et al., 2021) introduced predictor\u2013corrector samplers with multiple corrective iterations at high noise, directly informing FSG\u2019s strategy to concentrate iterations early. EDM (Karras et al., 2022) further justified emphasizing high-noise steps via principled sigma schedules and error analyses.\nFinally, Consistency Models (Song et al., 2023) introduced a fixed-point/consistency mindset across noise levels, conceptually resonating with the paper\u2019s \u201cgolden path\u201d\u2014latents yielding consistent outputs under both conditional and unconditional generation. Integrating these insights, the paper reframes CFG as a (inefficient) single-step fixed-point iteration and proposes FSG: multi-iteration, longer-interval subproblems prioritized early in the trajectory to achieve efficient convergence toward a consistent guidance path.",
