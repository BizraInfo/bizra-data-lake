  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014showing that a single historical sample suffices to learn a target expenditure plan that delivers optimal O(\u221aT) regret\u2014rests on two converging lines of work. First, the problem formulation and controller come from the budgeted repeated-auction literature. Balseiro, Besbes, and Weintraub identified the shadow-price/threshold structure as optimal under known distributions, and subsequent work on learning in repeated auctions with budgets adopted a learn-then-track blueprint with regret guarantees but required \u0398(T log T) samples to fit stable spending plans. Pacing as a market mechanism further legitimized controllers that track target spend over time (Conitzer et al.), providing the operational context for this paper\u2019s plan-plus-controller architecture. Second, the methodological leap to single-sample learning is inspired by limited-information auction theory: Dhangwatnotai, Roughgarden, and Yan, and later D\u00fctting, Feldman, Kesselheim, and Lucier, showed that single-sample thresholds can be remarkably effective, a principle this work adapts to calibrate spending thresholds robustly from one sample. The regret yardstick and budget-coupled learning backdrop come from Bandits with Knapsacks, which set the O(\u221aT) target the authors match. Finally, by contrasting with sample-heavy learn-then-commit paradigms in online stochastic allocation (e.g., Agrawal and Devanur), the paper crystallizes its gap: prior pacing methods needed \u0398(T log T) data to be stable, whereas a carefully designed single-sample estimator suffices, even under time-varying distributions.",
