  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014an adaptive, wavelet-based online forecaster that achieves minimax regret over general Besov spaces and further adapts locally to spatially inhomogeneous smoothness\u2014emerges at the intersection of online chaining methods, Besov complexity theory, and spatially adaptive wavelet estimation. Gaillard et al.\u2019s chaining forecaster is the immediate baseline: it established multiscale online regression with optimal rates for H\u00f6lder/Lipschitz classes but required known global smoothness and offered no spatial adaptivity. Rakhlin and Sridharan\u2019s sequential complexity framework provides the formal vehicle to prove minimax optimality, allowing the present work to translate metric entropies into sharp regret bounds in the adversarial setting. Those entropies and approximation properties come from classical Besov theory\u2014Birman and Solomyak\u2019s results on entropy/widths of Besov/Sobolev embeddings\u2014thereby fixing the target rates our algorithm must meet. Meyer\u2019s wavelet characterization of Besov spaces makes the algorithmic design possible: it lets the learner operate directly on wavelet coefficients with scale-dependent penalization that mirrors Besov norms. For local adaptivity, the authors draw conceptual inspiration from Donoho and Johnstone\u2019s spatially adaptive wavelet shrinkage, transporting its core idea\u2014resolution selection that varies with local regularity\u2014into an online, adversarial, convex-loss regime. Finally, to realize space-local updates operationally, they extend the specialist/sleeping-experts machinery of Freund et al., instantiating specialists as localized wavelet atoms active only on their spatial supports. Together, these works directly shape the paper\u2019s algorithmic architecture, its adaptation mechanisms, and its optimal regret analysis.",
