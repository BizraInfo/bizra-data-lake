  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014demonstrating how implicit multi-hop reasoning emerges in transformers and diagnosing it with cross-query semantic patching and a cosine-based representational lens\u2014builds on three converging threads. First, training-dynamics insights from Grokking (Power et al., 2022) establish that models can transition from rote memorization to systematic generalization when trained in controlled synthetic settings, motivating the authors\u2019 from-scratch setup and their three-stage developmental account. Second, mechanistic interpretability of transformer computations provides templates for identifying reusable subroutines: induction-head analyses (Olsson et al., 2022) show how attention circuits implement multi-step dependencies, while causal mediation/activation patching (Vig et al., 2020) introduces interventionist tools to test whether specific internal states causally drive behavior. The authors\u2019 cross-query semantic patching extends these interventions across inputs to validate semantically reusable intermediates. Third, representation-probing methods\u2014Logit Lens (nostalgebraist, 2020) and its calibrated extension, the Tuned Lens (Belrose et al., 2023)\u2014inspire the paper\u2019s cosine-based lens, which assesses whether intermediate representations align with target semantics and correlates this alignment with reasoning success. Finally, compositional generalization work in symbolic querying (CFQ; Keysers et al., 2020) and multi-hop KG reasoning (BetaE; Ren et al., 2020) directly shapes the study\u2019s evaluation protocol: they establish that exposure to particular query structures is often necessary for cross-structure generalization, anticipating the authors\u2019 finding that second-hop generalization depends on query-level compositional exposure. Together, these prior strands enable a principled, mechanistic explanation of implicit reasoning without explicit intermediate verbalization.",
