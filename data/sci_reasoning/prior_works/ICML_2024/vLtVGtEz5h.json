  "synthesis_narrative": "S3W\u2019s core innovation\u2014fast, parallelizable sliced Wasserstein distances for spherical distributions via stereographic projection with explicit distortion correction\u2014sits squarely on the intellectual lineage of sliced optimal transport and Radon-based formulations. Bonneel et al. (2015) provided the foundational blueprint: approximate high-dimensional OT by integrating 1D Wasserstein distances over projected views, tightly linked to the Radon transform. Kolouri et al. (2019) generalized this paradigm to non-linear and generalized Radon transforms, a crucial step S3W builds upon to define spherical slicing after mapping the sphere to Euclidean space. Park et al. (2018) further grounded the use of Radon-style transforms for probability measures, informing S3W\u2019s transform-driven perspective and facilitating principled distortion handling.\n\nOn the application side, existing spherical OT solvers\u2014typified by semi-discrete Newton methods (Kitagawa et al., 2019)\u2014deliver accurate geodesic-cost OT but remain computationally heavy; S3W explicitly addresses this gap with a highly parallel slicing pipeline. Moreover, ideas from max-sliced Wasserstein (Deshpande et al., 2019)\u2014optimizing over directions to induce invariances\u2014directly inspire S3W\u2019s rotationally invariant variant, which minimizes dependence on a chosen orientation. Finally, manifold sliced Wasserstein (Nguyen et al., 2022) offers a direct baseline for doing sliced OT on manifolds; S3W specializes to spheres and achieves speed by stereographically flattening the geometry and analytically compensating for the conformal distortion. Together, these works directly enabled S3W\u2019s formulation and motivated its efficiency and invariance properties.",
