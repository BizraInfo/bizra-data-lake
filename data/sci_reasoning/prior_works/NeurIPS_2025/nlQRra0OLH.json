  "synthesis_narrative": "UniVF advances video fusion by unifying cross-modality fusion with explicit temporal modeling via optical-flow-based feature warping, and by introducing VF-Bench to evaluate spatial quality and temporal consistency together. This direction is grounded in three lines of prior work. First, task-optimized motion estimation for video processing, inaugurated by TOFlow, established that alignment via learned flow tailored to the downstream objective substantially boosts quality; UniVF generalizes this principle to the fusion setting and uses flow to temporally align and aggregate informative content. Second, recurrent multi-frame architectures such as FRVSR and BasicVSR demonstrated effective strategies for propagating information through time\u2014via flow warping, bidirectional propagation, and feature accumulation\u2014to achieve temporally consistent reconstruction. UniVF inherits these ideas to design a multi-frame fusion backbone that reduces flicker while preserving details. Reliable warping hinges on accurate motion; RAFT provides a robust, differentiable optical flow formulation that underlies UniVF\u2019s alignment quality. Third, on the fusion side, U2Fusion pioneered a single network that handles multiple image-fusion tasks without task-specific heads; UniVF extends this unified perspective from static images to video, adding temporal modeling to cover multi-exposure, multi-focus, infrared\u2013visible, and medical fusion. Finally, the evaluation philosophy of VF-Bench builds on established task-specific spatial metrics (e.g., MEF-SSIM) and integrates flow-guided temporal consistency measures popularized in video restoration and perceptual works like TecoGAN. Together, these works directly shaped UniVF\u2019s core design\u2014flow-guided multi-frame fusion\u2014and its comprehensive, temporally aware benchmarking protocol.",
