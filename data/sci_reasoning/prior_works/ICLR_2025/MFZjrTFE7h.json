  "synthesis_narrative": "D-FINE\u2019s core idea\u2014replacing direct coordinate regression with fine-grained, iteratively refined distributions and coupling this with bidirectional localization self-distillation\u2014sits at the intersection of three influential threads. First, DETR established the end-to-end, query-based detection framework, while Deformable DETR and DINO showed the value of multi-scale features and iterative refinement across decoder layers. D-FINE preserves this architecture but shifts what is being iteratively refined: not coordinates, but probability distributions that capture finer localization cues at intermediate stages. Second, distribution-based box regression from GFL/DFL demonstrated that discretized distributions provide richer supervisory signals than point estimates, improving localization quality. D-FINE generalizes this from one-shot distribution prediction to a progressive refinement process, yielding a more expressive intermediate representation for DETR\u2019s decoder. Third, the self-distillation literature\u2014exemplified by Born-Again Networks\u2014motivates transferring a model\u2019s own knowledge to itself. D-FINE\u2019s GO-LSD adapts this notion to localization: deeper layers\u2019 refined distributions supervise shallower layers, while later layers focus on reduced residuals, mirroring the progressive quality improvements popularized by Cascade R-CNN. Together, these influences crystallize into a DETR that is both more precise in localization and more trainable, with fine-grained distributions enabling better guidance and GO-LSD ensuring effective knowledge flow across decoder depths.",
