  "synthesis_narrative": "Classical trust-region theory formalized conditions under which model-based steps yield global convergence and linear or even quadratic local rates, with the Mor\u00e9\u2013Sorensen framework specifying optimality conditions and step computation even for indefinite curvature. Steihaug demonstrated that solving the trust-region subproblem within a low-dimensional subspace can preserve convergence while reducing computational burden, establishing the value of subspace methods for second-order steps. Nesterov and Polyak showed that leveraging second-order information with appropriate regularization achieves the optimal O(\u03b5^{-3/2}) iteration complexity to first-order stationarity, and the adaptive cubic regularization line of work made this bound algorithmically practical while clarifying second-order guarantees. In parallel, randomized second-order methods such as Newton Sketch and subsampled Newton revealed that random projections or sampling can approximate Newton directions at much lower cost, but their strongest guarantees typically require convexity and do not ensure nonconvex second-order stationarity or fast local rates. Together, these strands pointed to a gap: a low-cost, subspace second-order method with trust-region safeguards that attains optimal first-order iteration complexity and robust nonconvex second-order and local convergence guarantees. By combining the trust-region control principles and subproblem optimality conditions with randomized subspace construction, and calibrating them to match the O(\u03b5^{-3/2}) benchmark, the present work synthesizes a homogenized, random-subspace trust-region scheme that maintains descent/negative-curvature exploitation, certifies \u03b5-approximate second-order stationarity under rank-deficient conditions, and achieves linear-to-quadratic local convergence.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, random subspace methods have been actively studied for large-dimensional nonconvex problems. Recent subspace methods have improved theoretical guarantees such as iteration complexity and local convergence rate while reducing computational costs by deriving descent directions in randomly selected low-dimensional subspaces. This paper proposes the Random Subspace Homogenized Trust Region (RSHTR) method with the best theoretical guarantees among random subspace algorithms for nonconvex optimization. RSHTR achieves an $\\varepsilon$-approximate first-order stationary point in $O(\\varepsilon^{-3/2})$ iterations, converging locally at a linear rate. Furthermore, under rank-deficient conditions, RSHTR satisfies $\\varepsilon$-approximate second-order necessary conditions in $O(\\varepsilon^{-3/2})$ iterations and exhibits a local quadratic convergence. Experiments on real-world datasets verify the benefits of RSHTR.",
