  "synthesis_narrative": "FlashMD\u2019s central innovation\u2014directly predicting long-stride updates of molecular positions and momenta while preserving correct equilibrium and time-dependent properties\u2014sits at the intersection of structure-preserving dynamics learning, equivariant graph modeling, and stochastic ensemble-aware simulation. Hamiltonian Neural Networks and Lagrangian Neural Networks established that encoding the mechanics of phase space and symmetries into neural parameterizations yields physically faithful, long-horizon rollouts. FlashMD extends these principles to high-dimensional many-body molecular systems, embedding Hamiltonian structure into its architecture to maintain conservation properties over strides that are orders of magnitude larger than conventional integrator steps.\n\nEquivariant GNNs, particularly EGNN and NequIP, demonstrated how rotation/translation symmetries and local interactions can be captured to achieve accurate predictions in molecular settings. FlashMD leverages these equivariant message-passing ideas not to output forces, as in NequIP, but to map full states across long strides while respecting SE(3) symmetry. In contrast to Deep Potential MD, which accelerates simulations by approximating forces yet remains bound to small timesteps, FlashMD learns the integrator itself, bypassing the stability limits of traditional time discretizations.\n\nFinally, to operate across thermodynamic ensembles, FlashMD draws on Neural SDEs to model stochastic thermostats and barostats, and on graph-network simulators for stable multi-step rollouts and mitigation of error accumulation. Together, these works directly motivate FlashMD\u2019s Hamiltonian-structured, equivariant, and stochastic-aware design, enabling accurate, ensemble-general long-stride molecular dynamics.",
