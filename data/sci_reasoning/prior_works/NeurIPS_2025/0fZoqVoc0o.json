  "synthesis_narrative": "ROS-Cam sits at the intersection of classical SfM/BA and RGB-only geometric supervision, rethinking camera parameter optimization for dynamic scenes. Its optimization backbone is rooted in bundle adjustment as formalized by Triggs et al., and operationally inspired by the COLMAP pipeline of Sch\u00f6nberger and Frahm. However, where COLMAP presumes static scenes and dense correspondences, ROS-Cam introduces patch-wise tracking filters to produce a maximally sparse yet reliable set of temporal constraints. This design descends from KLT-style sparse tracking (Tomasi\u2013Kanade), prioritizing patch-level stability over raw keypoint density to better survive occlusions and local motion.\n\nThe paper\u2019s central advance in dynamic scenes is its outlier-aware joint optimization that down-weights moving regions without motion masks. This draws directly from robust estimation theory\u2014M-estimators and IRLS as unified by Black and Rangarajan\u2014while conceptually generalizing the robust fitting spirit of RANSAC from hard inlier tests to soft, differentiable weighting inside BA. In parallel, its RGB-only supervision ethos is aligned with unsupervised depth/ego-motion learning (Zhou et al.), which demonstrated that photometric consistency and adaptive weighting can supervise geometry without external labels; ROS-Cam adapts this idea to classical optimization rather than learned models. Finally, optimizing intrinsics from video without GT priors ties back to self-calibration (Pollefeys et al.), replacing algebraic constraints with robust, patch-induced geometric relations. Together, these threads yield an efficient, mask-free, RGB-only camera optimization method for dynamic scenes.",
