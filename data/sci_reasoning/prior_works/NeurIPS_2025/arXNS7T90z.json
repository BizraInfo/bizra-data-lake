  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014non-asymptotic excess-risk analysis of a two-step Transfer MNI and identification of \u2018free-lunch\u2019 covariate-shift regimes\u2014rests on merging two theoretical lineages: benign overfitting in overparameterized linear models and transfer/domain-adaptation under distribution shift. Bartlett et al. (2020) establish when the minimum-\u21132-norm interpolator benignly overfits, providing the conceptual and technical baseline that this work extends to heterogeneous source\u2013target settings. Complementing this, Hastie et al. (2019) deliver sharp risk characterizations for ridgeless least squares under random design, furnishing the quantitative tools to compare pooled versus target-only MNI and to derive finite-sample excess-risk trade-offs. Belkin et al. (2019) frame why interpolation can generalize (double descent), motivating the search for transfer regimes where more data\u2014even heterogeneous\u2014can help.\nOn the transfer side, Ben-David et al. (2010) supply discrepancy-based generalization bounds for covariate shift, which the paper leverages to formalize when a source domain is informative for a target. Mansour et al. (2009) extend this to multiple sources, directly shaping the paper\u2019s multi-source setting and the need for principled source selection to avoid negative transfer. Maurer et al. (2016) analyze benefits of shared linear representations across tasks, inspiring the paper\u2019s two-step estimator structure and its alignment conditions. Finally, Shimodaira (2000) provides the classic covariate-shift lens and weighting rationale that guides the identification of \u2018free-lunch\u2019 regimes and the design of a data-driven procedure to detect informative sources. Together, these works enable a rigorous synthesis: min-norm interpolation\u2019s geometry plus covariate-shift theory yields precise, actionable transfer guarantees.",
