  "synthesis_narrative": "RidgeLoRA\u2019s core contribution is to preserve LoRA\u2019s parameter efficiency while overcoming its inherent low-rank expressivity bottleneck through a matrix ridge\u2013enhanced full-rank approximation with accompanying theory. The foundational LoRA formulation (Hu et al., 2022) provides the architectural template and the low-rank update parameterization that RidgeLoRA directly modifies. Subsequent LoRA variants\u2014AdaLoRA (Zhang et al., 2023) and DoRA (Liu et al., 2024)\u2014established that vanilla LoRA\u2019s fixed, low-rank constraint can limit representation and that enhancing the update (via adaptive rank or weight decomposition) restores capacity. These works directly motivate RidgeLoRA\u2019s goal: match full-rank fine-tuning without inflating adapter rank or memory.\nAt the mathematical core, RidgeLoRA appeals to ridge (Tikhonov) regularization (Hoerl & Kennard, 1970) to stabilize the effective inverse/approximation underlying the update, thereby expanding the effective rank and yielding a tighter upper bound on representational error than vanilla LoRA. This principled regularization contrasts with heuristic rank increases, providing a theoretically grounded pathway to full-rank\u2013like behavior.\nIn the broader PEFT context, QLoRA (Dettmers et al., 2023) sets a bar for memory-efficient fine-tuning that approaches full-rank performance; RidgeLoRA complements this by targeting the adapter\u2019s expressivity itself, helping to match or surpass full-rank training under tight memory budgets. Finally, the intrinsic dimensionality perspective (Aghajanyan et al., 2020) contextualizes when low-dimensional updates suffice and when they do not\u2014precisely the gap RidgeLoRA fills via ridge-enhanced approximation.",
