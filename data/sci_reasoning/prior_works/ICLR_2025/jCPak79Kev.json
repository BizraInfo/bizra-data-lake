  "synthesis_narrative": "AnalogGenie\u2019s core contribution\u2014data-driven generation of analog circuit topologies\u2014grows from two converging lineages. First, classical analog synthesis established the problem and its gap. Koza\u2019s genetic programming work demonstrated that analog topologies can be discovered automatically by searching graph-structured spaces, but suffered from slow, sample-inefficient evolutionary search. In contrast, Hershenson, Boyd, and Lee\u2019s geometric programming showed that once a topology is fixed, automatic sizing can be powerful, thereby underscoring the unsolved need for principled topology discovery that AnalogGenie directly tackles.\nSecond, recent advances in graph generative modeling provided the technical machinery for reliable structure generation. DiGress introduced discrete denoising diffusion for categorical graphs; AnalogGenie extends this paradigm to typed circuit netlists, adding device/port semantics and circuit validity constraints. Complementary ideas from JT-VAE and GraphAF\u2014constructing graphs via reusable substructures and constraint-aware autoregression\u2014inform AnalogGenie\u2019s representation choices (e.g., motifs/subcircuits) and validity control during generation.\nFinally, successes of learning in digital EDA, exemplified by Mirhoseini et al. on placement and DRiLLS on logic synthesis, provided empirical motivation that foundation-model style generators can meaningfully accelerate IC design. AnalogGenie translates these insights to the analog domain\u2019s central bottleneck\u2014topology discovery\u2014by pairing a comprehensive analog-circuit dataset/representation with a graph-generative engine customized to electrical constraints.",
