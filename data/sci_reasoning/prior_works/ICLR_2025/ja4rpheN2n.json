  "synthesis_narrative": "PANDA introduced a principled way to integrate prior biological interaction knowledge with gene expression to reconstruct regulatory networks, demonstrating that curated PPIs and motif data can anchor data-driven edge inference. LIONESS showed how to derive individualized networks from population-level reconstructions, providing a route toward context-specific interaction maps but relying on post hoc sample deconvolution rather than joint learning. The joint graphical lasso formalized simultaneous estimation of multiple related class-specific networks via shared structure, highlighting a need for representations that capture both common and condition-specific edges. VaDE established a deep generative framework in which a discrete latent variable discovers clusters directly from data, yielding robust unsupervised subtype discovery. Variational Graph Auto-Encoders demonstrated that GNN encoders can learn node embeddings whose inner products reconstruct graph edges, offering a flexible mechanism for link prediction conditioned on graph structure. Network-Based Stratification revealed that patient subtyping improves when molecular profiles are coupled to protein interaction networks, underscoring the value of network priors in stratification.\nTogether these works expose an opportunity: jointly discover disease subtypes while inferring subtype-specific gene interactions grounded in known physical networks. GeSubNet synthesizes VaDE-style generative subtyping with VGAE-inspired graph encoding, uses PANDA\u2019s knowledge-integration principle to preserve physical interactions, and adopts the joint-estimation spirit of the graphical lasso to separate shared versus subtype-specific edges, thereby overcoming LIONESS\u2019s post hoc limitation and NBS\u2019s lack of gene-level interaction prediction.",

    "abstract": "Retrieving gene functional networks from knowledge databases presents a challenge due to the mismatch between disease networks and subtype-specific variations. Current solutions, including statistical and deep learning methods, often fail to effectively integrate gene interaction knowledge from databases or explicitly learn subtype-specific interactions. To address this mismatch, we propose GeSubNet, which learns a unified representation capable of predicting gene interactions while distinguishing between different disease subtypes. Graphs generated by such representations can be considered subtype-specific networks. GeSubNet is a multi-step representation learning framework with three modules: First, a deep generative model learns distinct disease subtypes from patient gene expression profiles. Second, a graph neural network captures representations of prior gene networks from knowledge databases, ensuring accurate physical gene interactions. Finally, we integrate these two representa",
