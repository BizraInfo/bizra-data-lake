  "synthesis_narrative": "Differentiable Hierarchical Visual Tokenization (DHVT) targets the core limitation introduced by ViT\u2019s fixed patch tokens (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020): rigid grids ignore image structure yet are deeply embedded in pretrained backbones. DHVT\u2019s solution draws on the superpixel literature to represent images as coherent, vectorizable regions. Classic SLIC (Achanta et al., 2012) established the value of region-level grouping for downstream efficiency and raster-to-vector conversion. Superpixel Sampling Networks (Jampani et al., 2018) then made pixel-to-region assignment differentiable with soft associations, providing a direct methodological template for DHVT\u2019s pixel-level, content-adaptive token formation.\n\nOn the transformer side, TokenLearner (Ryoo et al., 2021) demonstrated that adaptively selecting or aggregating tokens can boost performance while remaining compatible with existing ViT stacks. DHVT generalizes this adaptivity to the pixel level and augments it with principled complexity control: inspired by X-means (Pelleg & Moore, 2000), DHVT uses information criteria (e.g., AIC/BIC) to guide hierarchical split/merge decisions, enabling end-to-end, data-driven model selection of token granularity.\n\nMaking such decisions differentiable relies on established relaxations for discrete choices. Gumbel-Softmax (Jang et al., 2017) provides the reparameterization tools for learning discrete assignments, while VQ-VAE (van den Oord et al., 2017) shows how discrete representations can be integrated into neural training and later consumed by existing architectures. Together, these works directly inform DHVT\u2019s core: a differentiable, hierarchical, information-theoretic visual tokenizer that adapts at pixel-level resolution, plugs into pretrained ViTs for classification and dense prediction, and naturally supports raster-to-vector conversion through region-based tokens.",
