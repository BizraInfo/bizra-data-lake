  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014identifying when distinct training procedures have equivalent dynamics via topological conjugacy\u2014rests on two pillars: a precise notion of dynamical equivalence and a computable, data-driven test. Koopman\u2019s original operator-theoretic formulation provided the lens to encode nonlinear dynamics linearly in function space, while Mezi\u0107\u2019s development of Koopman spectral analysis established that spectral objects (eigenvalues/eigenfunctions) are invariants under conjugacy, making them suitable markers of equivalence. Applied Koopmanism further connected these invariants to practical computation and clarified their behavior under coordinate changes, directly shaping the paper\u2019s choice of spectral criteria. The computational backbone comes from EDMD, which enables robust estimation of Koopman spectra from sampled training trajectories, allowing the proposed equivalence test to be executed on real optimization dynamics.\nOn the validation side, the optimization literature supplies canonical equivalences the method should recover. Beck and Teboulle\u2019s mirror descent framework and its dual-coordinate interpretation, together with Kivinen and Warmuth\u2019s exponentiated-gradient-as-gradient-descent-in-log-space result, offer concrete instances of algorithmic conjugacy. Shalev-Shwartz\u2019s synthesis of online gradient descent and online mirror descent situates these relationships in the online learning setting used by the paper\u2019s experiments. Together, these works directly enable the paper\u2019s key idea: use Koopman spectral invariants, estimated from data, to detect when different training algorithms or parameterizations are topologically conjugate\u2014and thus dynamically equivalent.",
