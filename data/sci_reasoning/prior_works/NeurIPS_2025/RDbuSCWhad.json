  "synthesis_narrative": "PD-SSM targets the core tension in state-space models between computational efficiency and expressivity. S4 established the modern SSM blueprint\u2014linear recurrences discretized from continuous-time dynamics with structured transition operators that enable parallel convolution\u2014while HiPPO provided stability and complex-eigenvalue machinery that made such discretizations robust. Mamba advanced this line with hardware-friendly, linear-time scan-based inference, showing state updates can be parallelized without sacrificing sequential fidelity. PD-SSM embraces these efficiency and stability pillars but rethinks the transition matrix: instead of dense or purely diagonal structures, it uses a product of a column one-hot (routing/permutation-like) matrix and a complex diagonal, achieving the O(n)-per-scan cost characteristic of diagonal SSMs.\n\nThis P\u00b7D parameterization draws directly on the structured-matrix literature typified by Monarch, where alternating permutation and diagonal factors yield expressive yet fast linear maps. Crucially, PD-SSM links SSM dynamics to automata theory: the WFST/WFA perspective (Mohri\u2013Pereira\u2013Riley) casts state transitions as weighted linear operators; spectral WFA results (Balle\u2013Carreras\u2013Quattoni) further ground their linear-algebraic realization; and Myhill\u2013Nerode minimality justifies the claim of optimal state size for tracking N-state FSAs. The result is an SSM layer that preserves diagonal-level compute and stability while restoring the discrete state-tracking power of finite automata via a sparse, permutation\u2013diagonal transition\u2014providing provable expressive guarantees and practical parallelism.",
