  "synthesis_narrative": "Two largely separate lines of work crystallized proportional fairness in clustering: centroid-based models (k-median\u2013like), where each point is assigned to a representative and pays its distance, and non-centroid models (k-center/diameter\u2013like), where a point\u2019s loss is its distance to the farthest point in its cluster. Chen et al. (ICML 2019) formalized proportional fairness for the centroid paradigm via core and FJR-style guarantees, while Caragiannis et al. (NeurIPS 2024) established analogous notions and algorithms for the non-centroid, diameter-based paradigm. The present paper\u2019s key contribution is to unify these by introducing semi-centroid clustering, in which each point\u2019s loss blends centroid and diameter components, and by delivering a polynomial-time constant-factor approximation to the core across this spectrum.\nConceptually, the centroid side inherits the assignment-to-representatives perspective from Monroe\u2019s fully proportional representation, and its fairness relaxations build on JR/EJR principles from approval-based committee voting (Aziz et al. 2017), which motivate the FJR relaxation used in clustering. Technically, controlling a mixed loss calls for interpolation ideas reminiscent of ordered k-median (Chakrabarty\u2013Swamy 2018), which bridges k-median and k-center. Classical k-center guarantees (Gonzalez 1985) support the diameter component of the analysis. By marrying the centroid and non-centroid traditions within one model and proof framework, the paper recovers prior guarantees at both extremes and extends proportional fairness\u2014via core and FJR\u2014to intermediate regimes and even heterogeneous metrics.",
