  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014exact minimax sample-complexity gains from encoding invariances in kernel ridge regression on compact manifolds\u2014sits at the intersection of operator-based RKHS theory, manifold spectral geometry, and invariant representation design. The operator-theoretic backbone comes from Smale\u2013Zhou and Caponnetto\u2013De Vito, who relate KRR excess risk to the spectrum of an associated integral operator and deliver optimal rates under eigen-decay and source conditions. To specialize these bounds on manifolds, the authors leverage geometric spectral asymptotics: Weyl\u2019s law for elliptic operators (H\u00f6rmander) determines how eigenvalues scale with intrinsic dimension, a theme echoed in manifold regression results for Gaussian processes (Yang\u2013Dunson), where rates depend on the manifold dimension via heat/diffusion kernels. On the invariance side, representation-theoretic constructions of group-invariant kernels (Kondor) provide the mechanism to encode symmetries through group averaging for compact/Lie groups. Prior learning-theoretic work on invariance (Sokolic et al.) established that, for finite groups, generalization improves proportionally to group size; the present paper proves an analogous, minimax-optimal effect in KRR, and further extends it to positive-dimensional Lie groups, where benefits manifest as a reduction in effective manifold dimension plus a quotient-volume factor. Inspired by manifold regularization\u2019s geometric framing (Belkin\u2013Niyogi\u2013Sindhwani), the authors pivot from invariant polynomials to a differential-geometric analysis on group actions and quotient manifolds, yielding precise, geometry-driven sample-complexity gains.",
