  "synthesis_narrative": "BumbleBee (BB) fuses three strands of prior art to achieve a generalist whole-body humanoid controller. First, its expert-generalist training pipeline is rooted in mixture-of-experts and distillation. The classic Adaptive Mixtures of Local Experts motivates BB\u2019s motion clustering: partitioning heterogeneous demonstrations into behaviorally coherent groups and learning specialized experts per cluster. Policy Distillation then provides the blueprint to consolidate those experts into a single generalist by supervising a unified policy on expert rollouts, preserving competence across tasks without catastrophic interference.\nSecond, BB\u2019s ability to acquire agile whole-body skills draws on physics-based motion imitation. DeepMimic established how to learn high-fidelity humanoid behaviors from motion data, while AMP showed that learned motion priors can stabilize multi-style control and improve robustness\u2014both informing BB\u2019s expert training within clusters to cover diverse motion types without sacrificing agility.\nThird, BB\u2019s sim-to-real bridge is modeled after residual learning. Residual Reinforcement Learning demonstrated that learning delta (residual) actions on top of a nominal policy effectively compensates for model mismatches on hardware; BB adopts iterative delta action modeling to refine experts with real robot data before distillation. Finally, BB\u2019s clustering leverages representation learning and semantics: autoencoder-based motion embeddings (Holden et al.) capture dynamics for similarity grouping, and motion\u2013language datasets like KIT-ML supply textual descriptors that augment clustering with semantic structure. Together, these influences yield BB\u2019s expert-to-generalist framework that scales across conflicting whole-body behaviors while remaining hardware-robust.",
