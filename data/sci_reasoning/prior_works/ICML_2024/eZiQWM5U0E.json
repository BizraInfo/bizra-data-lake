  "synthesis_narrative": "HJFBiO\u2019s core idea\u2014achieving optimal convergence complexity for nonconvex-PL bilevel optimization while being fully Hessian/Jacobian-free\u2014sits at the intersection of three direct lines of work. First, classic implicit-differentiation bilevel methods (Ghadimi and Wang, HOAG) defined the modern problem formulation and algorithms but rely on Hessian inverses or Hessian\u2013vector products, creating the explicit computational bottleneck HJFBiO targets. Second, scalable implicit differentiation in large-scale hyperparameter/meta-learning (Rajeswaran et al.; Lorraine et al.) demonstrated practical approximations that reduce or avoid explicit Hessian inversion, directly inspiring the search for principled, provably efficient hypergradient computation that removes all Hessian/Jacobian manipulation. Third, the PL condition\u2019s theory (Karimi et al.) provides the structural property enabling global convergence rates; HJFBiO capitalizes on this to derive optimal complexity in the nonconvex-PL bilevel regime. Additionally, Jacobian-free implicit techniques from equilibrium models (Bai/Kolter/Koltun) influenced the algorithmic design principle of extracting gradients without ever forming or inverting Jacobians/Hessians. Together, these works identify the gap\u2014state-of-the-art bilevel methods under nonconvex-PL either incur heavy second-order computations or lack optimal guarantees\u2014and supply the ingredients HJFBiO refines: implicit differentiation without second-order burdens and PL-based analysis. HJFBiO unifies these strands to deliver the first Hessian/Jacobian-free method with optimal complexity for nonconvex-PL bilevel optimization.",
