  "synthesis_narrative": "SEAL\u2019s core idea\u2014scalable, label-free pretraining of LiDAR sequence segmenters by distilling vision foundation models\u2014stands on three converging lines of work. First, PointPainting established the practical bridge between cameras and LiDAR by projecting 2D semantics onto 3D points via calibration, while xMUDA formalized camera\u2013LiDAR consistency and cross-modal self-training to reduce 3D label needs. SEAL generalizes both, replacing task-specific 2D predictors and supervised signals with powerful VFMs and enforcing consistency at both camera\u2013LiDAR and point-to-segment levels.\nSecond, the rise of VFMs provides the supervisory breadth SEAL exploits. SAM offers robust, promptable masks that transfer fine-grained, category-agnostic boundaries; CLIP and OpenSeg contribute open-vocabulary, transferable semantics. Prior 3D open-vocabulary efforts like OpenScene showed that multi-view lifting of 2D VLM features can endow 3D scenes with rich semantics without 3D annotations. SEAL extends this to the challenging automotive setting, treating long LiDAR sequences and varied sensors in an off-the-shelf manner.\nThird, unsupervised 3D representation learning demonstrated that spatial correspondences and temporal coherence are powerful regularizers\u2014PointContrast being emblematic. SEAL integrates similar spatiotemporal constraints but anchors them to VFM-derived segments, yielding more structured supervision. By unifying these strands\u20142D-to-3D projection and consistency, VFM-based supervision, and spatiotemporal regularization\u2014SEAL achieves scalable, consistent, and generalizable segmentation across diverse point cloud datasets without 2D or 3D annotations during pretraining.",
