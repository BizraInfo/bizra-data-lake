  "synthesis_narrative": "The Decision-Pretrained Transformer (DPT) emerges at the intersection of in-context learning and sequence-modeling approaches to control. GPT-3\u2019s discovery that transformers can learn from examples within their context window suggested a general mechanism for rapid adaptation without parameter updates, motivating DPT to bring this paradigm to decision-making. Earlier meta-RL work, particularly RL^2 and PEARL, demonstrated that agents can infer task identity and learn to explore by processing recent experience; DPT adopts this context-as-task signal but replaces recurrent/latent encoders with attention over trajectories. The modern sequence-modeling view of RL, crystallized by Decision Transformer and Trajectory Transformer, established that supervised training on trajectories can yield strong control policies from offline data. Building on this, DPT modifies the conditioning structure: rather than return prompts or purely generative modeling, it uses an in-context dataset plus a query state to directly predict optimal actions, enabling both online adaptation and offline conservatism to arise from a single supervised objective. Finally, Algorithm Distillation provided the closest demonstration that transformers can implement in-context RL by imitating a learning algorithm; DPT shows such behavior can be induced even more simply, via supervised pretraining on diverse tasks\u2019 optimal actions, without distilling an explicit algorithm. Together, these works directly informed DPT\u2019s core insight: transformers can be pretrained with a supervised, context-conditioned objective to perform RL in-context, exhibiting exploration and generalization beyond the training distribution.",
