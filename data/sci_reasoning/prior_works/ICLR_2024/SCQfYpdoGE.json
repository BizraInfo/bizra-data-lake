  "synthesis_narrative": "Actionable recourse was first grounded by Ustun et al., who formalized feasible changes with immutable and discrete features, and encoded actionability via optimization constraints. Karimi et al. then framed recourse as sequences of feasible interventions, using structural constraints to define exactly which counterfactual states are attainable through actions. Poyiadzi et al. brought a path-based perspective, finding feasible counterfactuals along a graph built on observed data so that traversed steps correspond to plausible, incremental changes. Wachter et al. introduced the counterfactual objective itself for black-box models, prioritizing minimally different alternatives but without explicit feasibility or actionability guarantees. In parallel, robustness verification work by Weng et al. established the certify-over-a-set paradigm, proving properties for all inputs within a region rather than testing points one by one. Upadhyay et al. highlighted that many recourse procedures break under realistic constraints and perturbations, underscoring the need for guarantees rather than heuristic solutions. Together these strands expose a clear opportunity: use action semantics to define the set of states an individual can genuinely reach, and apply verification-style reasoning to certify whether any point in that set changes the model\u2019s prediction. The current work synthesizes these insights by constructing reachable sets for discrete feature spaces and verifying, via model queries, whether recourse exists\u2014shifting from counterfactual search to certifiable recourse verification and revealing when predictions are fixed (precluding access) in consequential domains.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models are often used to decide who receives a loan, a job interview, or a public benefit. Models in such settings use features without considering their *actionability*. As a result, they can assign predictions that are \\emph{fixed} -- meaning that individuals who are denied loans and interviews are, in fact, *precluded from access* to credit and employment. In this work, we introduce a procedure called *recourse verification* to test if a model assigns fixed predictions to its decision subjects. We propose a model-agnostic approach for verification with *reachable sets* -- i.e., the set of all points that a person can reach through their actions in feature space. We develop methods to construct reachable sets for discrete feature spaces, which can certify the responsiveness of *any model* by simply querying its predictions. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study on the infeasibility of recourse on datasets from consumer finance. Our results highlight how models c",
