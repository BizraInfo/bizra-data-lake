  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of this paper is to explain why public pretraining so effectively boosts differentially private (DP) fine-tuning, and to turn that explanation into concrete, robustness-improving prescriptions. De et al. (2022) established the striking empirical fact that public pretraining enables high-accuracy DP image classification but did not provide a mechanistic account. The present work supplies that account by importing the Neural Collapse (NC) framework of Papyan et al. (2020) and the layer-peeled modeling perspective (Zhu et al., 2021) to formalize \u2018ideal\u2019 last-layer features and their geometry. Building on the implicit-bias theory of Soudry et al. (2018), the paper analyzes linear heads atop near-perfect features to show that, once features are sufficiently close to the NC solution, misclassification depends on margins and becomes independent of the ambient dimension. This analysis is carried out for the exact DP optimization primitive introduced by Abadi et al. (2016)\u2014DP-SGD/NoisyGD with Gaussian noise\u2014thus directly tying NC geometry to DP training dynamics. Finally, recognizing practical fragilities identified by Andrew et al. (2019) around clipping and scale, the paper translates its theory into actionable strategies (feature normalization and PCA) that stabilize NoisyGD under DP constraints. Together, these works form the direct intellectual lineage: from the phenomenon (De et al.) to the geometric lens (NC and layer-peeling), the optimization foundation (DP-SGD, implicit bias), and the robustness prescriptions that close the loop.",
