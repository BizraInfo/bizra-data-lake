  "synthesis_narrative": "Classical transport theory showed that solutions to the continuity equation can be represented by Lagrangian flow maps pushing forward an initial density, establishing a precise link between a vector field, its induced diffeomorphism, and density evolution. Normalizing flows operationalized this change-of-variables perspective for probabilistic modeling, enabling densities to be expressed through parameterized invertible transformations with tractable Jacobian determinants. Real NVP introduced practical, stable diffeomorphic architectures via coupling layers, making large-scale invertible maps feasible. In parallel, Neural ODEs and their continuous normalizing flow instantiations modeled dynamics by integrating vector fields, computing the instantaneous change in log-density via divergence, while FFJORD further demonstrated free-form continuous dynamics yet at the cost of expensive ODE solvers and stochastic trace estimators. PINNs approached PDE learning by minimizing residuals of governing equations, trading exact constraint satisfaction for penalty-based enforcement that can be unstable and computationally demanding. Flow Matching later emphasized learning vector fields whose induced flows transport densities along time-consistent paths that satisfy the continuity equation. Together these threads revealed that exact mass conservation arises naturally from diffeomorphic pushforwards, but existing methods either enforce PDEs approximately or rely on costly numerical solvers. The natural next step is to directly parameterize a time-conditioned diffeomorphism so that density evolution follows from change-of-variables, and to derive the velocity analytically as the time derivative of the map composed with its inverse\u2014thereby guaranteeing the continuity equation without PDE penalties or ODE integration while retaining the expressivity of modern flow architectures.",
