  "synthesis_narrative": "SAFIM\u2019s key contribution is a syntax-aware, multi-language benchmark for Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) code completion, paired with robust prompt designs and post-processing, to fairly compare LLMs and probe how FIM pretraining affects both FIM and left-to-right (L2R) inference. This agenda is a direct extension of InCoder, which crystallized the modern FIM objective and two-sided context prompting that SAFIM evaluates systematically. StarCoder and Code Llama operationalized FIM at scale with specialized infill tokens and native infilling modes; these models provide natural baselines and motivate SAFIM\u2019s cross-model comparisons and analysis of pretraining choices versus model size.\nConceptually, SAFIM\u2019s finding that FIM pretraining helps L2R inference echoes T5\u2019s broader result that denoising/infilling-style objectives improve downstream generalization beyond the pretraining setting. On the evaluation side, CodeBLEU demonstrated that structural properties of code\u2014syntax and data flow\u2014are vital for meaningful assessment, inspiring SAFIM\u2019s syntax-aware post-processing and structure-focused tasks (e.g., blocks and conditionals). CodeXGLUE provided a blueprint for rigorous, standardized code benchmarks, which SAFIM extends to the FIM regime with consistent prompt templates and parsing-aware checks. Finally, The Stack and the BigCode effort foregrounded data quality, deduplication, and contamination concerns; SAFIM\u2019s temporal filtering of recent submissions directly adopts these principles to minimize contamination and enable fairer comparisons. Together, these works provided the FIM objective, model support, evaluation philosophy, and data curation practices that SAFIM integrates into a coherent, syntax-aware FIM benchmark.",
