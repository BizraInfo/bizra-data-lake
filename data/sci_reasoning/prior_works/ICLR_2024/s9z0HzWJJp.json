  "synthesis_narrative": "Portfolio theory established that decisions over time series can be evaluated via risk\u2013return trade-offs, formalized by Markowitz as portfolio selection. In parallel, tool-augmented language agents showed how to interleave reasoning and external actions: ReAct introduced a thought\u2013action\u2013observation loop that couples deliberation with search and environment feedback. Chain-of-Thought revealed that eliciting explicit, stepwise reasoning improves complex analysis, while HyDE demonstrated that generating a hypothesis-like surrogate text can steer retrieval to the most informative evidence. Self-Ask further refined multi-step reasoning by decomposing questions into subproblems and using targeted searches to verify intermediate claims. Reflexion argued that agents benefit from iterative self-improvement across episodes, pointing to the need for persistent memory and longitudinal feedback rather than single-shot tasks. In time-series decision-making, FinRL operationalized backtested actions over financial signals, illustrating how real-world streams can serve as an objective feedback channel for agent performance.\nTogether these strands suggested a natural opportunity: combine explicit hypothesis-driven reasoning, retrieval-verified evidence, and tool-mediated action with a rigorous, backtestable objective over time series. By extending portfolio selection beyond markets to diverse societal indicators, the hyperportfolio formulation provides scalable, reliable evaluation. Structuring agents into distinct roles mirrors ReAct\u2019s deliberate act loops while incorporating CoT-style reasoning, HyDE-guided retrieval, and Self-Ask verification to ground analyses in real sources. Embedding this within a persistent environment addresses Reflexion\u2019s call for lifelong improvement, yielding agents that analyze real-world text and act on time series with objective, longitudinal feedback.",

It consists of (1) information sources from news, social media, reports, etc., (2) a knowledge base built from books, journals, and encyclopedias, plus a toolbox of Internet and knowledge graph search interfaces, (3) 30K high-quality time series in finance, economy, society, and polls, which support a novel task called \"hyperportfolio\", that can reliably and scalably evaluate societal analysis and decision-making power of agents, inspired by portfolio optimization with time series as assets to \"invest\". We also propose a novel Analyst-Assistant-Actuator architecture for the hyperportfolio task, and a Hypothesis & Proof prompting for producing in-depth analyses on input news, articles, etc. to assist decision-making.
