  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014casting curve-based low-light enhancement as a continuous exposure process via Neural ODEs\u2014arises directly from two interacting lines of work. On the LLIE side, Zero-DCE introduced an unsupervised, zero-reference paradigm that models enhancement as iterative application of learnable exposure curves. While effective, both Zero-DCE and its improved variant Zero-DCE++ retain a discrete, multi-step update rule whose performance depends on the chosen number of iterations and lacks convergence guarantees\u2014precisely the instability this paper targets. RetinexNet provided the broader illumination-manipulation framing and priors (e.g., smoothness of illumination) that curve-based methods operationalize, and Learning to See in the Dark highlighted the impracticality of requiring paired data, pushing the field toward unsupervised objectives.\n\nOn the modeling side, Neural Ordinary Differential Equations supplied the foundational machinery to treat residual updates as continuous-time flows and to train them efficiently, while the dynamical-systems perspective of Haber and Ruthotto clarified how discrete residual steps correspond to ODE discretizations and how stability can be reasoned about. By synthesizing these strands, the paper reinterprets the discrete curve-iteration in zero-reference enhancement as an ODE whose trajectory encodes continuous exposure adjustment. This removes sensitivity to the step count, enables principled control over stability/convergence, and directly addresses the main practical limitation in prior curve-adjustment approaches.",
