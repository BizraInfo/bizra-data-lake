  "synthesis_narrative": "Covered Forest advances the WL-centered view of graph learning from pure expressivity to generalization by explicitly tying MPNN behavior to a fine-grained, WL-informed graph similarity. The lineage starts with Weisfeiler\u2013Leman (WL), which provides the canonical combinatorial scaffold for understanding what MPNNs can distinguish. Shervashidze et al. operationalized WL into learnable similarity via the WL kernel, showing that WL-derived structural notions can drive statistical learning. Xu et al. then firmly linked MPNNs to 1-WL, giving the precise expressivity lens that Covered Forest must respect while seeking generalization guarantees. Morris et al.\u2019s survey unified WL, counting logic, and GNNs, motivating Covered Forest\u2019s use of WL/logic-informed graph similarity as the vehicle for theory. On the similarity side, Togninalli et al.\u2019s WWL kernel demonstrated how to refine WL similarity with optimal transport; Covered Forest pushes this line further by introducing a more structure-sensitive similarity (covered forest) and, crucially, using it to derive bounds that capture aggregation choices and practical surrogate losses. Barcel\u00f3 et al. provide the logical characterization that underpins these similarity constructions, ensuring the theory matches MPNN invariances. Finally, prior stability/generalization analyses such as Keriven\u2019s highlighted limitations\u2014focus on restricted architectures, random-graph regimes, or 0\u20131-style risks\u2014that Covered Forest overcomes with structure-aware, aggregation-sensitive, and loss-flexible generalization results.",
