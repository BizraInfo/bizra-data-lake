  "synthesis_narrative": "StackSight\u2019s core innovation\u2014neurosymbolic chain-of-thought decompilation of WebAssembly\u2014stands on three pillars synthesized from prior work. First, the formalization of WebAssembly by Haas et al. precisely defines a typed, structured, stack-based execution model; this makes it possible to design a static analysis that soundly visualizes and tracks implicit stack effects. Classical decompilation and compiler frameworks then inform how to make that stack explicit: Soot\u2019s stack-to-3-address lifting for JVM bytecode provides the methodological template for materializing stack values, while Yakdan et al.\u2019s structured control-flow recovery guides the translation of Wasm\u2019s block/loop/if constructs into idiomatic high-level code. Practical Wasm tooling, notably Binaryen\u2019s wasm-decompile, establishes a concrete baseline for turning Wasm into readable C-like snippets, highlighting both the feasibility and limitations of purely symbolic approaches.\nSecond, recent advances in code-oriented LLMs (Codex) demonstrate that neural models can synthesize and translate code, making them plausible decompiler back-ends once provided with precise semantic cues. Chain-of-thought prompting operationalizes this capability, eliciting stepwise reasoning that aligns naturally with StackSight\u2019s stack-delta traces and control annotations.\nFinally, the neurosymbolic synthesis paradigm exemplified by DreamCoder motivates the coupling: symbolic program analysis constrains and scaffolds the search space, while neural reasoning proposes high-level reconstructions. StackSight integrates these threads by feeding analysis-derived stack effects and structural invariants into CoT-guided LLM prompts, yielding readable, structurally faithful C++ that outperforms prior Wasm decompilation tools.",
