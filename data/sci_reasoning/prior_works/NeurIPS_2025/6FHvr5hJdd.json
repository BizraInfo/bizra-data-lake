  "synthesis_narrative": "SignViP\u2019s core innovation\u2014compressing multiple fine-grained motion conditions (body pose and 3D hands) into discrete tokens and using them to drive a signer-preserving video diffusion model\u2014arises from the convergence of discrete tokenization, effective quantization, and conditionable diffusion-based video synthesis. At the representation level, VQ-VAE established that high-dimensional signals can be discretized into compact code sequences without sacrificing fidelity, a prerequisite for turning motion conditions into tokens. FSQ provides an efficient, stable quantizer that yields ultra-compact, low-bitrate codes, making translated tokens easier to predict and integrate while preserving detail essential for sign articulation (especially hands).\n\nOn the generative side, Video Diffusion Models supply the backbone capable of high-fidelity, temporally coherent video synthesis. ControlNet\u2019s conditioning strategy informs SignViP\u2019s jointly trained multi-condition encoder that injects structured control into diffusion, but now with richer, token-derived embeddings rather than a single coarse map. Historically, vid2vid and end-to-end SLP pipelines like Progressive Transformers showed the viability\u2014but also the limitations\u2014of skeleton-only intermediates for sign production, motivating SignViP\u2019s move to multi-condition, fine-grained guidance to enhance naturalness and signer identity. Finally, MotionGPT demonstrated that discrete motion tokens are a robust interface between language and motion generation; SignViP generalizes this idea to a multi-condition setting tailored to sign language, where discretized pose and 3D hand tokens bridge linguistic inputs and a diffusion-based video generator.",
