  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core idea\u2014solving stochastic optimal control by iteratively transporting a path-space measure under explicit trust-region (KL) constraints\u2014stands on the fusion of SOC-as-inference and trust-region optimization. Kappen (2005) and Todorov (2009) provide the theoretical backbone: with quadratic control costs, SOC objectives become KL-regularized path-space problems, legitimizing the use of divergences between controlled and prior dynamics as the central optimization primitive. Building on this, Kakade and Langford\u2019s Conservative Policy Iteration and Schulman et al.\u2019s TRPO contribute the crucial operational insight that constraining KL change between successive solutions yields monotonic, stable progress; the present work transposes this trust-region logic from policy distributions to full path measures. Neal\u2019s Annealed Importance Sampling supplies the geometric annealing perspective\u2014constructing a sequence from prior to target\u2014while the proposed trust region determines adaptive, principled step sizes along this annealing path rather than relying on ad hoc schedules. On the generative modeling side, De Bortoli et al.\u2019s Diffusion Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge connects path-space KL control with entropic optimal transport, aligning directly with the paper\u2019s measure transport view and motivating its application to diffusion processes. Finally, the SDE formulation of diffusion models by Song et al. sets the application context in which path-space updates can be used to enhance sampling and fine-tuning. Together, these works directly inform the paper\u2019s trust-region constrained, annealing-based measure transport algorithm in path space.",
