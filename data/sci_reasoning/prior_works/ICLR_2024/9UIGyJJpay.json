  "synthesis_narrative": "Diffusion-based de novo protein design introduced a residue-frame generative formulation, with RFdiffusion showing that effective generation hinges on a structure encoder that operates directly on rigid-body frames. AlphaFold\u2019s structure module provided the seminal Invariant Point Attention mechanism, computing geometric signals from points anchored to residue frames; this became the default frame encoder later reused in design systems. RoseTTAFold operationalized a compatible IPA-based architecture with single and pair representations, supplying the practical template for frame-conditioned modeling in generative pipelines. In parallel, Geometric Vector Perceptrons established that neural networks can carry vector channels and apply learned vector-linear maps, enabling rich vector computations beyond scalar-only graph features in protein tasks. EGNN further demonstrated that learnable functions of 3D coordinates can produce equivariant vector updates without heavy tensor machinery, validating the efficacy of coordinate-driven vector operations. Meanwhile, ProteinMPNN exemplified the strong performance of atom-feature\u2013based design, but also highlighted a key limitation: many protein ML encoders depend on atom-wise distances and angles, which are unavailable when modeling only residue frames during diffusion.\nCollectively, these works exposed a gap: frame-based generative design lacked an encoder with the expressive vector reasoning seen in atom-based models, while prevailing IPA layers offered only a basic geometric interface to frames. The natural next step was to combine the coordinate-driven equivariant intuition of EGNN with the vector-channel expressiveness of GVP, but implement it natively on frame-anchored coordinates within the IPA-era architecture used by RFdiffusion\u2014precisely the niche a vector-field layer over virtual atoms fills.",

    "abstract": "Advances like protein diffusion have marked revolutionary progress in $\\textit{de novo}$ protein design, a central topic in life science. These methods typically depend on protein structure encoders to model residue backbone frames, where atoms do not exist. Most prior encoders rely on atom-wise features, such as angles and distances between atoms, which are not available in this context. Only a few basic encoders, like IPA, have been proposed for this scenario, exposing the frame modeling as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce the Vector Field Network (VFN), that enables network layers to perform learnable vector computations between coordinates of frame-anchored virtual atoms, thus achieving a higher capability for modeling frames. The vector computation operates in a manner similar to a linear layer, with each input channel receiving 3D virtual atom coordinates instead of scalar values. The multiple feature vectors output by the vector computation are then used to update the re",
