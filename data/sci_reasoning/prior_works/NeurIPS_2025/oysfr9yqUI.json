  "synthesis_narrative": "SSA-MVC addresses the overlooked but realistic setting where multi-view samples are unsynchronized across views. Its pipeline\u2014choosing a benchmark view by label agreement, representing non-aligned samples via similarities to aligned ones, and constructing a cross-view similarity graph to drive alignment\u2014sits at the intersection of ensemble clustering, unsupervised alignment, and scalable spectral approximation.\nThe benchmark selection via cluster-label matching is rooted in cluster ensemble principles (Strehl & Ghosh), which quantify agreement across partitions, and is operationalized with optimal label correspondence using the Hungarian assignment (Kuhn). Rather than presuming synchronized instances for co-regularization as in co-regularized multi-view spectral clustering (Kumar & Daum\u00e9), SSA-MVC first reconciles unsynchronized data, thereby extending cross-view agreement to settings without one-to-one sample pairing.\nIts core alignment criterion is structurally inspired: like manifold alignment without correspondence (Wang & Mahadevan), SSA-MVC leverages within-view geometry to infer cross-view correspondences, and akin to spectral/graph matching methods (Leordeanu & Hebert) and IsoRank, it promotes matches whose neighborhoods are mutually consistent across views. Finally, scalability is achieved by representing non-aligned samples through similarities to already aligned samples\u2014conceptually analogous to Nystr\u00f6m/landmark-based spectral methods (Fowlkes et al.) that compress pairwise structures via anchor relations. Together, these ideas directly inform SSA-MVC\u2019s scalable cross-view sample alignment with view-structure similarity, enabling robust multi-view clustering under unsynchronized sampling.",
