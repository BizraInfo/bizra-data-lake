  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014a differentiable discrete stopping time enabling direct optimization of time-to-target loss\u2014stands at the intersection of differentiable optimization, ODE-based views of algorithms, and differentiable halting. Foundationally, Maclaurin et al. and Domke demonstrated that iterative optimization procedures can be differentiated end-to-end to obtain hypergradients of algorithm parameters. Andrychowicz et al. extended this paradigm to learning optimizers by unrolling optimization dynamics, but objectives were typically defined at a fixed horizon. Baydin et al. brought hypergradients into the online setting for adaptive learning rates, suggesting the feasibility and value of real-time hyperparameter updates.\n\nThe present work advances these lines by shifting the objective from fixed-time performance to time-to-accuracy, historically viewed as non-differentiable due to discrete stopping. To resolve this, it draws on the continuous-time perspective popularized by Su, Boyd, and Cand\u00e8s, treating discrete algorithms as ODE discretizations and linking stopping to continuous hitting times. Neural ODEs further provide the adjoint sensitivity calculus and event-differentiation intuition needed to compute gradients efficiently with respect to such stopping events. Conceptually, Graves\u2019 Adaptive Computation Time shows that halting can be learned in a differentiable manner, and this paper repurposes that insight for optimization algorithms with a theoretically justified, ODE-grounded stopping mechanism.\n\nTogether, these prior works supply the differentiation machinery, continuous-time justification, and halting intuition that directly enable a practical, efficient algorithm for differentiable stopping time\u2014unlocking online hyperparameter tuning and learning-to-optimize objectives focused on minimizing wall-clock or iteration time to a target loss.",
