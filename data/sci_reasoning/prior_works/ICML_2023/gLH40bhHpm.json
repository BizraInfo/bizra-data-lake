  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key advance\u2014Locality Sensitive Quantization (LSQ) for fast differentially private KDE\u2014emerges by explicitly bridging classical fast KDE approximations with differential privacy. Prior DP work by Hall, Rinaldo, and Wasserman established mechanisms for privately releasing functions like KDEs but, when applied to Gaussian kernels in d dimensions, required discretizations or basis expansions whose complexity grows exponentially with d. This limitation directly motivates the central aim of the present work: to inherit the speed of modern non-private KDE approximations while preserving privacy. LSQ does so by observing that several leading KDE approximators produce linear sketches of the data. For shift-invariant kernels, Random Fourier Features (Rahimi\u2013Recht) yield finite-dimensional embeddings whose sums can be privatized to give DP-KDE with accuracy inherited from RFF. For Gaussian kernels, the (Improved) Fast Gauss Transform (Greengard\u2013Strain; Yang\u2013Duraiswami\u2013Gumerov\u2013Davis) represents kernel sums via cluster/Taylor expansions; LSQ privatizes these coefficients to obtain a fast private Gauss transform. Finally, LSH-based estimators (Datar\u2013Immorlica\u2013Indyk\u2013Mirrokni; Charikar\u2013Siminelakis) show how collision probabilities estimate kernel values; LSQ casts LSH as a quantization scheme, adds calibrated noise to bucket counts, and thereby privatizes hashing-based KDE. By turning these non-private sketches into differentially private ones in a black-box manner, LSQ breaks the exponential-in-d barrier while retaining the computational advantages of RFF, FGT/IFGT, and LSH.",
