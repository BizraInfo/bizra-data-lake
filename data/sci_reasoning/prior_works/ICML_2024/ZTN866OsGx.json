  "synthesis_narrative": "MorphGrower\u2019s core idea\u2014plausible, topologically valid neuronal morphology generation via synchronized, layer-by-layer growth\u2014emerges from a direct synthesis of growth-based neuron modeling and modern structured generative modeling. Traditional generators like the TREES toolbox and NETMORPH established the problem as one of arbor growth and morphometric fidelity, but their dependence on expert-crafted rules and parameter tuning limited generalization and realism. The recent MorphVAE introduced a learning-based alternative but suffered from implausible and frequently invalid trees, providing the immediate gap MorphGrower addresses. To remedy this, MorphGrower borrows the central mechanism of parallel, stepwise expansion from L-systems, translating it into synchronized, breadth-wise growth across all active tips and coupling sibling branches to model their geometric correlations. This growth is executed conditionally\u2014each layer depends on the already formed structure\u2014reflecting the autoregressive conditioning principle popularized for graphs by GraphRNN, but specialized to trees with explicit level synchronization. Finally, inspired by structured validity enforcement in molecular generation (e.g., Junction Tree VAE), MorphGrower organizes decisions around branch points and local constraints to ensure topological soundness. Enabled by large curated datasets and standardized representations from NeuroMorpho.Org, MorphGrower unifies biologically motivated growth with learned, conditional structure modeling to surpass MorphVAE and rule-based systems in plausibility and validity.",
