  "synthesis_narrative": "Hybrid-Balance GFlowNet (HBG) directly emerges from the evolution of GFlowNet training objectives and the neural routing literature. The GFlowNet Foundations work by Bengio et al. established the framework and the Detailed Balance (DB) objective, defining local flow consistency. Malkin et al. later introduced Trajectory Balance (TB), which quickly became the default for combinatorial generation due to its strong global credit assignment\u2014also adopted by early GFlowNet-based routing methods. However, TB\u2019s weakness in local optimization is well documented and is exactly the limitation HBG targets. Madan et al. advanced the field with Subtrajectory Balance, empirically showing that balancing local and global signals can stabilize training; HBG extends this idea by adaptively hybridizing TB and DB in a principled manner, explicitly aligning their complementary strengths for VRPs.\nIn parallel, the neural routing line shaped HBG\u2019s inference design. Kool et al. codified the modern TSP/CVRP setup with explicit depot semantics and standardized decoding, which HBG leverages to craft a depot-centric inference routine exploiting the depot\u2019s higher branching flexibility. POMO by Kwon et al. highlighted how depot-centered and symmetry-aware decoding can materially improve routing solutions, directly inspiring HBG\u2019s specialized inference for CVRP. Finally, experience from GFlowNet applications on complex discrete structures (e.g., Deleu et al. in Bayesian structure learning) reinforced the practical need to reconcile DB and TB trade-offs\u2014precisely the niche HBG fills by adaptively combining them while remaining applicable to both depot and non-depot settings (CVRP and TSP).",
