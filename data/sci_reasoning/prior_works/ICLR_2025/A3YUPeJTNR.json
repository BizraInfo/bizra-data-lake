  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core idea\u2014modeling and quantifying the hidden cost of waiting for more accurate predictions in allocation\u2014sits at the intersection of predictive targeting, sequential decision theory, and the temporal dynamics of deployment. Prediction Policy Problems and Human Decisions and Machine Predictions established the dominant paradigm of using risk scores to rank individuals and allocate scarce resources, implicitly equating higher predictive accuracy with better social welfare. Classical decision theory provides the methodological backbone: Wald\u2019s Sequential Analysis and Chow\u2019s reject-option encode the mechanism by which information accrues over time and decisions can be deferred at a cost, while Blackwell\u2019s comparison of experiments articulates the value-of-information intuition that more informative signals should help. Recent work on the dynamics of algorithmic deployment, notably Delayed Impact of Fair Machine Learning and Performative Prediction, underscores that timing and interactions with the environment can overturn static guarantees. Building directly on these lines, the paper introduces a sequential observation model where predictions refine over time and then analyzes both the induced ranking and the welfare-maximizing allocation under resource constraints. The central contribution is a counterintuitive result: even as individual prediction accuracy improves with time, average ranking loss can worsen, revealing a principled failure mode of the \u201cwait for accuracy\u201d heuristic. This yields new guidance on when to act versus wait, refining the foundational predictive targeting framework by explicitly integrating the economics of timing.",
