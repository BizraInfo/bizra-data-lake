  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation\u2014bidirectional adaptation with decoupled predictors grounded in theory\u2014emerges by unifying insights from pseudo-labeling, consistency training, distribution alignment, and domain adaptation. Classical pseudo-labeling (Lee, 2013) and consistency-based SSL (Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017) supply the training paradigm but also the Achilles\u2019 heel: confirmation bias and predictor coupling. Empirically, Oliver et al. (2018) established that SSL can degrade under labeled\u2013unlabeled distribution mismatch, surfacing a practical gap. FixMatch (Sohn et al., 2020) became the dominant baseline, yet its single model both generates and consumes pseudo labels, making it especially susceptible to coupling and biased targets when distributions diverge. ReMixMatch (Berthelot et al., 2020) introduced distribution alignment, and AdaMatch (Berthelot et al., 2021) pushed toward a unified SSL\u2013DA view, but their alignment remains largely marginal/global and single-directional, offering limited, fixed-weight corrections. The present paper supplies a principled generalization analysis rooted in domain adaptation theory (Ben-David et al., 2010), pinpointing how discrepancies in pseudo-label and target predictions propagate error. This perspective motivates two key design moves: (1) decoupling the pseudo-label predictor from the target predictor to break harmful feedback loops, and (2) performing bidirectional adaptation\u2014toward the unlabeled distribution for debiased pseudo-labels and toward the target distribution for debiased target predictions\u2014thereby overcoming the restricted weighting and coupling limitations of prior SSL and alignment methods.",
