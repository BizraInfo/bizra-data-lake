  "synthesis_narrative": "Glaze proposed adding imperceptible perturbations to artists\u2019 images to induce mislearning of style by text-to-image models, operationalizing \u2018cloaks\u2019 specifically against style mimicry. DreamBooth established a practical personalization pipeline whereby a small set of images can fine-tune a diffusion model to capture a subject or style, forming a standard mechanism for style replication. Textual inversion showed an even lighter-weight path to personalization by optimizing an embedding to capture an artist\u2019s style, highlighting that minimal data and adaptation suffice to encode stylistic attributes. Earlier, Fawkes introduced the cloaking paradigm for training-time misuse\u2014perturbing public images so downstream models learn the wrong identity signals\u2014providing the conceptual blueprint later adopted for style protection. PhotoGuard generalized the notion of adversarially shielding images from diffusion models, proposing robust, invisible perturbations to block unauthorized edits, further cementing the defense class this paper scrutinizes. Athalye et al. revealed that defenses often collapse under benign transformations, arguing for evaluation protocols that incorporate simple, realistic pre-processing.\n\nTaken together, these works defined both the offense (personalization methods like DreamBooth/textual inversion) and the defense (training-time cloaks/perturbations like Glaze/PhotoGuard) for generative models. The evident gap was whether these perturbation-based protections withstand low-effort attacker pre-processing and standard robust training. Building on Athalye\u2019s evaluation principle, the paper systematically applies off-the-shelf transformations (e.g., upscaling) and routine augmentation during personalization to show that style mimicry remains successful in user studies, thereby demonstrating that adversarial perturbations cannot reliably protect artists.",

    "abstract": "Artists are increasingly concerned about advancements in image generation models that can closely replicate their unique artistic styles.\nIn response, several protection tools against style mimicry have been developed that incorporate small adversarial perturbations into artworks published online. In this work, we evaluate the effectiveness of popular protections---with millions of downloads---and show they only provide a false sense of security. We find that low-effort and \"off-the-shelf\" techniques, such as image upscaling, are sufficient to create robust mimicry methods that significantly degrade existing protections. Through a user study, we demonstrate that **all existing protections can be easily bypassed**, leaving artists vulnerable to style mimicry.  We caution that tools based on adversarial perturbations cannot reliably protect artists from the misuse of generative AI, and urge the development of alternative protective solutions.",
