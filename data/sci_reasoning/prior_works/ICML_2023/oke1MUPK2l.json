  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of this paper is to operationalize a state-dependent Riccati (SDRE) tracking controller for general nonlinear control-affine systems by learning the required state-dependent coefficient (SDC) factorization directly from data. Cloutier\u2019s seminal SDRE formulation established the foundational idea that nonlinear dynamics can be expressed in SDC form and stabilized via pointwise Riccati solutions; \u00c7imen\u2019s survey consolidated SDRE practice for regulation and tracking, providing the immediate baseline controller structure this work seeks to make data-driven. At the stability level, Lohmiller and Slotine\u2019s contraction analysis and Manchester and Slotine\u2019s control contraction metrics frame feedback design in terms of state-dependent metrics; these works motivate viewing the Riccati solution as a learned, control-oriented metric while identifying a gap: CCM synthesis can be computationally heavy. The present paper addresses this by leveraging the SDRE metric with an always-existing SDC factorization, which it learns from finite data. From a modeling perspective, Rugh and Shamma\u2019s gain scheduling theory contextualizes SDRE as x-scheduled LQR; here, the scheduling map (factorization) is inferred from data rather than hand-crafted. Finally, recent data-driven modeling approaches like Koopman-based deep embeddings (Lusch et al.) and sparse identification (Brunton et al.) demonstrate the promise of learning dynamics but lack guaranteed, readily synthesizable stabilizing feedback for general nonlinear systems\u2014precisely the gap this paper closes by learning a control-oriented SDC factorization for SDRE tracking.",
