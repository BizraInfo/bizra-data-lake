  "synthesis_narrative": "MetaFormer\u2019s core innovation\u2014using a single meta-tuned transformer that jointly models relationships among samples and across tasks through attention\u2014emerges from a clear lineage in few-shot learning. Matching Networks introduced the episodic formulation and support\u2013query attention, while Prototypical Networks formalized metric-based episodic classification through prototype aggregation; MetaFormer\u2019s Masked Sample Attention subsumes these by learning to attend over samples and enforce task-specific consistency inside a ViT. TADAM showed that conditioning embeddings on a task representation boosts performance, directly motivating MetaFormer\u2019s Patch-grained Task Attention to learn task descriptors from patch tokens and adapt features while suppressing background noise. FEAT brought transformer-based set-to-set adaptation to few-shot learning, demonstrating the value of modeling support-sample relations; MetaFormer extends this idea by embedding sample relations natively within a pretrained ViT and further elevates it to the task dimension. CrossTransformers highlighted the importance of patch-level correspondences and background filtering in few-shot transfer, inspiring MetaFormer\u2019s patch-grained design for task attention. Finally, the debate opened by Rethinking Few-Shot Image Classification\u2014questioning meta-learning\u2019s utility relative to transfer learning\u2014paired with Meta-Baseline\u2019s evidence that pretraining plus episodic meta-finetuning remains powerful, framed the problem setting and principal baseline that MetaFormer directly improves upon. Together, these works lead to a unified, attention-only meta-tuned transformer that advances few-shot classification by explicitly encoding both sample and task structure.",
