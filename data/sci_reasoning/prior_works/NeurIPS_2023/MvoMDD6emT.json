  "synthesis_narrative": "SPF\u2019s key contribution\u2014predicting state-sequence representations in the Fourier domain to improve long-horizon decision making\u2014sits at the intersection of predictive representation learning in RL and frequency-aware modeling in time-series analysis. On the RL side, SPR and Dreamer crystallized the idea that forecasting future states or latent features yields data-efficient policies by aligning learned representations with dynamics and control objectives. CURL and, more fundamentally, CPC, further established self-supervised prediction as a powerful driver for representation quality in sequential settings. SPF inherits this predictive paradigm but identifies a limitation shared by time-domain objectives: long-range, periodic, or slowly varying structure is difficult to capture directly in raw temporal space. The time-series community\u2019s advances\u2014exemplified by Autoformer and FEDformer\u2014demonstrated that moving into the frequency domain exposes regularities and long-range dependencies, enabling accurate long-horizon forecasts via autocorrelation and Fourier component selection. SPF transposes these insights into RL, positing that the spectral view of state trajectories reveals decision-relevant patterns obscured in time. Finally, classical spectral methods in RL, notably the Fourier basis for value function approximation, provide theoretical backing that low-frequency components efficiently encode smooth dynamics and values, legitimizing SPF\u2019s focus on frequency components. Together, these lines of work culminate in SPF\u2019s design: a predictive auxiliary task in the Fourier domain that yields more expressive, long-horizon-aware representations for sample-efficient RL.",
