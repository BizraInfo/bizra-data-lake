  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014provable identification of latent variable blocks using additive decoders and consequent Cartesian-product extrapolation\u2014sits at the intersection of nonlinear ICA theory and object-centric representation learning (OCRL). Classical results by Hyv\u00e4rinen and Pajunen established that nonlinear ICA is not identifiable without additional structure, setting the conceptual challenge this work addresses. Khemakhem et al. later showed that identifiability can be recovered by leveraging auxiliary variables under conditional exponential family assumptions; this paper complements and broadens that line by proving identifiability in a different regime: exact reconstruction with additive decoders and only weak assumptions on latent distributions, eschewing side information. Locatello et al.\u2019s impossibility result for unsupervised disentanglement further underscored the necessity of inductive biases, motivating the explicit additive architectural constraint.\nOn the modeling side, OCRL methods such as AIR, MONet, and IODINE introduced additive (mask-based) decoders that reconstruct images by summing per-object contributions. The present work abstracts this additive compositionality and provides rigorous guarantees for latent identification in such decoders, thereby offering theory that underwrites widely used OCRL practices. Finally, the identifiability result\u2019s form\u2014recovery up to permutation and block-wise invertible transformations\u2014echoes Independent Subspace Analysis, connecting the contribution to established block-identifiability notions. Together, these strands yield a principled route to both identifiable representations and out-of-support generation via recombining object-specific latents (Cartesian-product extrapolation).",
