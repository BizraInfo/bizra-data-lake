  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014an extreme value theory (EVT) explanation for why balancing groups by throwing away data can improve worst-group accuracy\u2014rests on two converging threads. First, the problem formulation and target metric were crystallized by work on subpopulation shift and group robustness: Hashimoto et al. demonstrated that ERM can disproportionately harm minority groups, and Sagawa et al. formalized worst-group risk and GroupDRO as a remedy, while WILDS standardized evaluation around worst-group accuracy on real datasets. Second, a longstanding empirical practice from the imbalanced learning literature\u2014captured by Weiss and Provost as well as He and Garcia\u2014showed that undersampling to equalize group/class sizes often boosts minority performance, yet lacked a principled explanation and even seemed to contradict learning theory\u2019s \u201cmore data helps\u201d intuition. This paper resolves that contradiction by importing EVT, as synthesized by Resnick: in heavy-tailed settings, the largest observed samples grow with group size, so majority groups contribute more extreme points that disproportionately shape linear decision boundaries. Balancing groups equalizes the tail extremes across groups, restoring geometric symmetry and thereby improving worst-group generalization. Thus, the present work directly builds on the worst-group formulation and empirical balancing practice, and it supplies the missing theoretical mechanism via EVT\u2019s scaling laws for extremes under heavy-tailed distributions.",
