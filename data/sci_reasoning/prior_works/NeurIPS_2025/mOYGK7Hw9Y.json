  "synthesis_narrative": "DeCaFlow synthesizes three strands of prior work to deliver a train-once causal generative model that answers a wide range of interventional and counterfactual queries under hidden confounding. First, Pearl\u2019s SCM framework and do-calculus, together with Shpitser and Pearl\u2019s identification results, provide the formal basis for determining which causal queries are identifiable from a known graph and observational data; DeCaFlow explicitly targets this class and uses the twin-network semantics to generate counterfactuals whenever their interventional counterparts are identifiable.\nSecond, DeCaFlow builds on the proxy-variable literature for deconfounding. Kuroki and Pearl showed how measurement/proxy variables can restore causal effects despite unmeasured confounding, and Miao\u2013Geng\u2013Tchetgen Tchetgen\u2019s proximal identification formalized bridge conditions enabling nonparametric recovery. DeCaFlow integrates these insights, using proxies to adjust when do-calculus alone is insufficient, while maintaining identification guarantees at the query level.\nThird, DeCaFlow leverages deep generative modeling to make these identification results computationally practical. Pawlowski\u2013Castro\u2013Glocker\u2019s deep structural causal models demonstrated that normalizing-flow parameterizations can support efficient interventional and counterfactual inference in SCMs without hidden confounding. DeCaFlow extends this paradigm to hidden-confounder settings and broad query classes, adopting flow architectures such as MAF for tractable, invertible mechanisms. Prior work like CEVAE established the viability of proxy-based deep generative deconfounding; DeCaFlow generalizes this to arbitrary continuous-variable causal queries with principled identifiability and superior empirical performance.",
