  "synthesis_narrative": "ADD sits at the intersection of unsupervised environment design (UED) and guided diffusion. On the UED side, PAIRED established regret as a powerful signal for crafting curricula: a teacher maximizes the gap between achievable return and the agent\u2019s performance to expose weaknesses. PLR further demonstrated that prioritizing high-regret or high-failure levels improves robustness and generalization in procedurally generated settings. Earlier open-ended generation, notably POET, emphasized both continual challenge and diversity, while ALP-GMM formalized targeting the learning frontier via progress signals. These works collectively motivate using a principled difficulty signal (regret/progress) and preserving diversity when shaping the training distribution.\n\nOn the generative modeling side, guided diffusion showed how external objectives can steer sampling. Dhariwal and Nichol\u2019s classifier guidance and Ho and Salimans\u2019s classifier-free guidance provided the toolkit to translate scalar signals into controlled conditional generation, including tuning guidance strength to balance fidelity and diversity. Diffuser extended this guidance paradigm into RL by conditioning trajectory generation on reward/value-related objectives.\n\nADD fuses these threads: it replaces teacher policies or replay heuristics with a diffusion-based environment generator and drives it using agent regret. This yields a generator that directly produces adversarial yet learnable environments while maintaining diversity\u2014addressing limitations of hand-designed curricula, parameter-only randomization, or selection-only methods. The result is a principled, scalable approach to robust policy learning via regret-guided diffusion.",
