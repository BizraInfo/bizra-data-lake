  "synthesis_narrative": "Rotation- and translation-equivariant modeling in 3D widely relies on coupling irreducible SO(3) representations through Clebsch\u2013Gordan-projected tensor products, formalized for point clouds by Tensor Field Networks, which crystallized the operation used throughout E(3)-equivariant models. Cormorant pushed such spherical tensor couplings to higher orders for molecular learning and made explicit the severe computational scaling incurred by repeated CG-based tensor products. In parallel, Clebsch\u2013Gordan Nets developed fully Fourier-space spherical CNNs where equivariant nonlinearities are realized as CG tensor products in the spherical harmonic domain, highlighting that equivariant coupling is equivalent to multiplying spherical functions and projecting back. The e3nn framework standardized these CG-based TensorProduct operators, making them the prevailing building block\u2014and practical bottleneck\u2014across modern E(3) architectures. From the signal-processing side, Spherical CNNs showed that spherical operations can be executed efficiently by leveraging FFTs on 2D longitude\u2013latitude grids, while McEwen and Wiaux established sampling theorems and fast SHTs that separate azimuthal Fourier modes, enabling practical changes of basis between spherical harmonics and 2D Fourier representations. Together, these works expose a clear opportunity: CG-based tensor products are the correctness-preserving mechanism for equivariance, but their cost explodes with order; meanwhile, multiplying spherical functions can be accelerated in Fourier-like bases. The present paper synthesizes these insights by exploiting the equivalence between CG couplings and Gaunt integrals to view tensor products as spherical-function multiplication, then changing basis to a 2D Fourier representation where this multiplication can be computed far more efficiently, yielding a drop-in acceleration for CG-based layers in e3nn-style and SE(3)-Transformer models.",

Enforcing this equivariance primarily involves the tensor products of irreducible representations (irreps). However, the computational complexity of such operations increases significantly as higher-order tensors are used. In this work, we propose a systematic approach to substantially accelerate the computation of the tensor products of irreps. We mathematically connect the commonly used Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to the Gaunt coefficients, which are integrals of products of three spherical harmonics. Through Gaunt coefficients, the tensor product of irreps becomes equivalent to the multiplication between spherical functions represented by spherical harmonics. This perspective further allows us to change the basis for the equivariant operations from spherical harmonics to a 2D Fourier basis. Consequently, the multiplication between spherical functions ",
