  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014establishing optimal posterior contraction rates for intrinsic Mat\u00e9rn Gaussian processes on compact Riemannian manifolds and showing that appropriately matched extrinsic Mat\u00e9rn priors achieve the same rate\u2014rests on three intertwined lines of prior work. First, van der Vaart and van Zanten (2008, 2011) provide the general Bayesian GP contraction framework and sharp Euclidean Mat\u00e9rn rate results. Their RKHS/small-ball toolkit and smoothness\u2013dimension trade-offs directly guide the manifold proofs and the rate formulas. Second, the operator/SPDE perspective of Mat\u00e9rn fields (Lindgren\u2013Rue\u2013Lindstr\u00f6m, 2011) combined with the intrinsic manifold construction of Mat\u00e9rn GPs (Borovitskiy et al., 2020) furnishes the exact prior family analyzed here: a Laplace\u2013Beltrami\u2013based Mat\u00e9rn whose RKHS and sample path regularity can be expressed via Sobolev/Bessel potential spaces on manifolds. The necessary manifold function-space technology and spectral characterizations are provided by Hebey (1996), enabling a clean identification of the prior smoothness with manifold Sobolev scales. Third, to compare intrinsic and extrinsic priors, the paper leverages trace and extension theorems (Jonsson\u2013Wallin, 1984) that relate Sobolev spaces in the ambient Euclidean space to those on the embedded manifold, showing rate equivalence once smoothness parameters are matched. Finally, optimality is assessed against classical minimax rates (Stone, 1982), confirming that the derived contraction rates achieve the intrinsic-dimension benchmark. Together, these works supply the prior definitions, analytical tools, and statistical benchmarks that directly enable the paper\u2019s main theorems.",
