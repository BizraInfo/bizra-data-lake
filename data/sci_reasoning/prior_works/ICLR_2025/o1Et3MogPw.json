  "synthesis_narrative": "AutoGen established a practical template for multi-agent LLM applications by scripting agent roles and their turn-taking with a GroupChat orchestrator; while effective, its agents are defined within the same framework and typically live in a single process, making communication patterns rigid. HuggingGPT demonstrated that an LLM can schedule and route tasks to diverse external models, revealing the power of integrating third-party capabilities, albeit through a centralized, task-specific pipeline tightly coupled to one ecosystem. MetaGPT operationalized multi-agent workflows with SOP-like role playbooks, delivering structured outputs but fixing collaboration into static sequences bound to its own agent definitions. ChatDev showed the utility of chat-like, role-based software teams but relied on pre-scripted, domain-tuned pipelines that lack adaptability. Generative Agents highlighted how message-driven social interactions can produce emergent coordination, though within a self-contained simulation rather than a heterogeneous, distributed system. Longstanding FIPA ACL specifications formalized interoperable agent communication via standardized message types and envelopes, setting a precedent for protocol-based agent interoperability. Together, these works expose a clear opportunity: multi-agent systems need the interoperability of classical MAS, the routing power of LLM controllers, and the flexibility of chat-style interactions\u2014without rigid pipelines or single-ecosystem lock-in. The current paper synthesizes these threads by introducing a protocol that standardizes how heterogeneous agents connect, an instant-messaging-like bus for scalable, distributed communication, and dynamic teaming and flow-control policies that generalize beyond fixed scripts\u2014a natural next step given the limitations and insights of prior frameworks.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has paved the way for the development of highly capable autonomous agents. However, existing multi-agent frameworks often struggle with integrating diverse capable third-party agents due to reliance on agents defined within their own ecosystems. They also face challenges in simulating distributed environments, as most frameworks are limited to single-device setups. Furthermore, these frameworks often rely on hard-coded communication pipelines, limiting their adaptability to dynamic task requirements. Inspired by the concept of the Internet, we propose the Internet of Agents (IoA), a novel framework that addresses these limitations by providing a flexible and scalable platform for LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. IoA introduces an agent integration protocol, an instant-messaging-like architecture design, and dynamic mechanisms for agent teaming and conversation flow control.
