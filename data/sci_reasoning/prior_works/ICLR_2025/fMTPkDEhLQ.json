  "synthesis_narrative": "Nemirovski and Yudin established the information-based oracle model and the adversarial hard-instance paradigm that underpin modern lower-bound proofs in convex optimization. Nesterov\u2019s universal gradient framework formalized H\u00f6lder-smoothness of order p with degree \u03bd and parameters (H, \u03bd) together with q-uniform convexity with parameter \u03c3, and analyzed algorithms whose rates exhibit explicit dependencies on these quantities. Building on this, Nesterov\u2019s implementable tensor methods gave practical p-th order procedures and matching upper bounds under H\u00f6lder continuity, with restart mechanisms under uniform convexity yielding characteristic accuracy dependencies. Woodworth and Srebro introduced a Gaussian-smoothing hard-instance technique for smooth convex optimization that precisely calibrates smoothness while maintaining difficulty for oracle-based methods. Carmon, Duchi, Hinder, and Sidford developed second-order oracle lower bounds via chain-style constructions that tightly control higher derivatives and track query complexity within the higher-order oracle model. Agarwal, Hazan, Kale, and Kakade provided information-theoretic lower bounds delineating how smoothness and strong convexity separately govern complexity, motivating sharper separation-of-parameter dependencies.\n\nTogether, these works revealed both the techniques and the gaps: while upper bounds existed for H\u00f6lder\u2013tensor methods and first- or second-order lower bounds were known, there was no tight oracle complexity delineating how high-order H\u00f6lder smoothness interacts with general q-uniform convexity, especially in asymmetric regimes q \u2277 p+\u03bd. By merging chain-type adversarial constructions with a smoothing approach refined via \u2113\u221e-truncated Gaussian kernels, and calibrating parameters to preserve uniform convexity while controlling p-th order H\u00f6lder constants, the present work derives tight bounds that match tensor-method upper limits and expose distinct H, \u03c3, and \u03b5 dependencies\u2014including the log\u2013log behavior\u2014across the two asymmetric regimes.",

Specifically, for a function whose $p^{th}$-order derivatives are H\u00f6lder continuous with degree $\\nu$ and parameter $H$, and that is uniformly convex with degree $q$ and parameter $\\sigma$, we focus on two asymmetric cases: (1) $q > p + \\nu$, and (2) $q < p+\\nu$. Given up to $p^{th}$-order oracle access, we establish worst-case oracle complexities of $\\Omega\\left( \\left( \\frac{H}{\\sigma}\\right)^\\frac{2}{3(p+\\nu)-2}\\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon}\\right)^\\frac{2(q-p-\\nu)}{q(3(p+\\nu)-2)}\\right)$ in the first case with an $\\ell_\\infty$-ball-truncated-Gaussian smoothed hard function and $\\Omega\\left(\\left(\\frac{H}{\\sigma}\\right)^\\frac{2}{3(p+\\nu)-2}+ \\log\\log\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\sigma^{p+\\nu}}{H^q}\\right)^\\frac{1}{p+\\nu-q}\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\right)\\right)$ in the second case, for reaching an $\\epsilon$-approximate solution in terms of the optimality gap.
