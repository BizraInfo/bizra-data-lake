  "synthesis_narrative": "Contrastive joint-embedding methods established instance discrimination as a pretext task where each image instance, under augmentations, forms the basis for representation learning, with linear probing as the standard readout to assess learned features; SimCLR crystallized this setup and evaluation practice. BYOL demonstrated that negative-free joint-embedding can avoid trivial collapse, highlighting both the diversity of JE training dynamics and the need for principled, training-time diagnostics of representation quality. Redundancy-reduction approaches like Barlow Twins promoted decorrelation and implicitly high covariance rank as desirable signals, while VICReg codified variance and covariance objectives that further elevated covariance-rank heuristics as indicators of health. Whitening-based SSL showed that enforcing full-rank, decorrelated features is feasible yet does not guarantee informative dimensions for discrimination, underscoring a mismatch between covariance rank and linear separability. In parallel, transferability estimators such as LogME predicted downstream performance via marginal evidence but relied on labeled target samples, limiting their applicability during label-free SSL pretraining. Together these works revealed a gap: prevailing rank/covariance signals are insensitive to whether dimensions are discriminative for the task at hand, and label-dependent transfer metrics are unusable during JE training. The natural synthesis is to measure rank through discriminative directions defined by between-class versus within-class scatter. By instantiating Fisher\u2019s LDA on the surrogate labels intrinsic to JE tasks, one can quantify the number of informative dimensions relevant to solving the SSL objective, yielding a label-free, training-time metric that better tracks linear probe performance.",

Without efficient and re-\nliable evaluation, it is difficult to iterate on architectural and training choices for\nJE methods. In this paper, we introduce LiDAR (Linear Discriminant Analysis\nRank), a metric designed to measure the quality of representations within JE archi-\ntectures. Our metric addresses several shortcomings of recent approaches based\non feature covariance rank by discriminating between informative and uninforma-\ntive features. In essence, LiDAR quantifies the rank of the Linear Discriminant\nAnalysis (LDA) matrix associated with the surrogate SSL task\u2014a measure that\nintuitively captures the information content as it pertains to solving the SSL task.\nWe empirically demonstrate that L",
