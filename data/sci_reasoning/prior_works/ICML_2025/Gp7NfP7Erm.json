  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014casting algorithm selection as learning a causal mechanism via a directed acyclic graph (DAG) over problem and algorithm features\u2014traces directly to two intertwined lineages. The first is the algorithm selection tradition inaugurated by Rice (1976), which formalized mapping instance characteristics to algorithm performance. This tradition matured through portfolio-based, correlation-driven systems such as SATzilla (Xu et al., 2008) and AutoFolio (Lindauer et al., 2016), which remain strong baselines but learn associations between meta-features and performance. Kotthoff\u2019s (2014) survey crystallized the limitations of this paradigm: heavy reliance on observed correlations, limited explainability, and brittleness under distribution shift. The second lineage is causal inference. Pearl\u2019s (2009) structural causal models provided the DAG formalism to represent mechanisms and reason about interventions and distribution changes. Building on this, Peters et al. (2016) showed that causal relations imply invariances across environments, while Arjovsky et al. (2019) operationalized invariance for robust prediction by discouraging reliance on spurious correlations. The present work fuses these threads: it replaces performance-from-features regression with a causal DAG that characterizes the distribution of algorithm features conditioned on problem features, leveraging invariance to enhance robustness under marginal distribution shifts and to support explainable, fine-grained selection via reconstruction of optimal algorithm features. Thus, the paper directly extends Rice\u2019s problem formulation and addresses Kotthoff\u2019s identified gaps using the invariance principles and modeling tools from modern causal inference.",
