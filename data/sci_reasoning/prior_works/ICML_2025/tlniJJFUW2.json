  "synthesis_narrative": "The ACD Repo\u2019s core innovation\u2014standardized, large-scale datasets for research-level conjecturing in algebraic combinatorics\u2014arises from two intertwined lineages: data-centric mathematical discovery and modern ML benchmarks. Historically, Graffiti and AutoGraphiX showed that assembling large collections of discrete objects and invariants enables algorithmic conjecture generation, seeding the workflow ACD seeks to benchmark. In parallel, OEIS institutionalized an examples-first practice for discovery, while FindStat brought that discipline to combinatorial objects and statistics, supplying the structural template that ACD explicitly extends to algebraic combinatorics tasks with millions of examples. On the ML side, Davies et al. demonstrated that learning systems can meaningfully guide mathematical intuition, but the field lacked shared, open benchmarks that reflect the open-endedness professional mathematicians face; ACD directly answers this deficit with research-level conjecturing tasks. Meanwhile, popular benchmarks like MATH honed problem solving on fixed-answer questions, leaving conjecture generation under-served\u2014precisely the gap ACD fills. Finally, ARC\u2019s emphasis on abstraction via induction from examples influenced ACD\u2019s evaluative stance: conjectures should emerge from patterns in data. Together, these works directly shaped ACD\u2019s formulation: curate large, structured example repositories around foundational and open problems in algebraic combinatorics to measure and catalyze ML-driven conjecturing at the frontier of pure mathematics.",
