  "synthesis_narrative": "Deep Fractional Fourier Transform leverages a lineage spanning FRFT theory, efficient computation, and transform-domain deep learning. Namias\u2019s seminal formulation of the fractional Fourier transform as a continuous rotation between spatial and frequency domains introduced the central unifying perspective the paper operationalizes in modern vision models. Almeida\u2019s analysis of FRFT for non-stationary signals supports the authors\u2019 motivation that fractional domains can better represent image structures that are neither purely spatial nor purely spectral.\n\nTranslating theory into practice hinges on computational advances by Ozaktas and collaborators: digital/fast FRFT algorithms and the discrete FRFT formulation make fractional transforms tractable and precise on discrete data, directly enabling the paper\u2019s fast 2D FRFT implementation. On the deep learning side, Mathieu\u2013Henaff\u2013LeCun\u2019s FFT-based convolution and Rippel\u2013Adams\u2019s spectral CNNs established that moving convolution and representation learning into transform domains is both principled and efficient. Complementarily, MWCNN showed that embedding spatial\u2013frequency transforms (wavelets) within CNN blocks improves image restoration, validating the architectural pattern that Deep FRFT generalizes with a richer, continuous family of fractional orders.\n\nSynthesizing these threads, the paper introduces MFRFC\u2014learning across multiple fractional orders to cover a continuum of spatial\u2013frequency perspectives\u2014and provides a fast 2D FRFT to make it practical at scale. Thus, foundational FRFT theory and algorithms directly couple with prior spectral/wavelet CNN paradigms to yield a unified, learnable spatial\u2013frequency operator for vision.",
