  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper advances the Hartline\u2013Roughgarden program of maximizing buyer utility through simple, information-robust mechanisms by moving from the identical-items, single-parameter world to multi-dimensional unit-demand preferences. Hartline and Roughgarden (2008) provide the conceptual and technical baseline: utility is upper-bounded by welfare, and in the i.i.d. m-unit setting the welfare\u2013utility gap is \u0398(1+log(n/m)). The present work preserves this welfare-benchmarking lens and shows the same tight dependence in the richer multi-dimensional setting via a reduction back to identical items.\n\nThe mechanismic backbone comes from sequential posted-pricing frameworks for unit-demand buyers (Chawla et al., 2010) and prior-independent design methodology (Dhangwatnotai et al., 2010), enabling distribution-robust mechanisms that target welfare without full prior knowledge. To obtain the (1\u22121/e) guarantee when items exceed buyers, the authors draw on prophet-inequality constants under structured feasibility (Kleinberg & Weinberg, 2012) and the classic 1\u22121/e bound from online bipartite matching (Karp\u2013Vazirani\u2013Vazirani, 1990), which together justify tight constant-factor welfare approximations implementable via posted prices.\n\nCrucial to proving tightness in both n and m is the ex-ante relaxation toolkit (Alaei, 2014), which facilitates reductions from multi-dimensional unit-demand demand to single-parameter identical-items instances, preserving approximation factors and enabling inheritance of lower bounds. Finally, broader posted-price welfare guarantees in multi-dimensional environments (Feldman\u2013Gravin\u2013Lucier, 2015) reinforce the choice of simple, prior-independent mechanisms. Collectively, these works shape both the benchmark (welfare), the mechanism class (prior-independent posted prices), and the proof strategy (prophet/matching constants and ex-ante reduction) that yield the paper\u2019s tight approximations.",
