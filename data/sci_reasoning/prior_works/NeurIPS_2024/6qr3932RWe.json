  "synthesis_narrative": "3DGM\u2019s key contribution\u2014emergent environment\u2013object decomposition from multitraverse RGB videos within a Gaussian-based mapper\u2014rests on three intertwined lines of prior work. First, its representation and optimization scaffold is 3D Gaussian Splatting (Kerbl et al.), which replaces MLP radiance fields with optimized 3D Gaussians for efficient, differentiable rendering and mapping, itself conceptually rooted in NeRF\u2019s multi-view photometric training (Mildenhall et al.). Second, the paper\u2019s central idea of separating persistent environment from transient/ephemeral content directly echoes NeRF in the Wild (Martin-Brualla et al.), which modeled per-image transients to robustly explain changing content; 3DGM operationalizes a similar separation but uses cross-traverse consistency as self-supervision and yields 2D ephemeral segmentation alongside a 3D map. Third, robotics and long-term SLAM works establish why and how to prefer persistent structure: DynaSLAM demonstrated that filtering dynamic objects stabilizes reconstruction, while Stenborg et al. leveraged semantics across revisits to improve localization by downweighting transients. Biber and Duckett provided the earlier long-term mapping principle of maintaining persistent maps amid environmental variation, which 3DGM modernizes with Gaussian rendering and data-driven learning. Finally, the paper\u2019s formulation\u2014environment pixels as inliers and ephemeral ones as outliers\u2014draws on robust estimation theory (Black & Rangarajan), motivating robust losses that naturally reject ephemeral inconsistencies across traversals. Together, these works directly shaped 3DGM\u2019s self-supervised, multitraverse-driven decomposition and its efficient 3DGS-based mapping pipeline.",
