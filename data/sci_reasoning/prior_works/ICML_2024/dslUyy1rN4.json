  "synthesis_narrative": "The position that automatic environment shaping should be the next frontier in RL is grounded in a decade of evidence that success in sim-to-real hinges far more on environment configuration than on incremental policy-optimization tweaks. Early domain randomization (Tobin et al., 2017) established that varying simulator parameters is a powerful instrument for transfer, and dynamics randomization (Peng et al., 2018) showed that robust real-world control emerges from training over families of dynamics rather than fixed MDPs. Automatic Domain Randomization in OpenAI\u2019s Rubik\u2019s Cube work (Akkaya et al., 2019) turned this insight into a closed-loop procedure, automatically widening parameter ranges to sustain learning progress\u2014an explicit instantiation of automated environment shaping.\nSimOpt (Chebotar et al., 2019) complemented this by tuning simulation parameters from real data, closing the loop between deployment and training and highlighting that system identification can be automated within the RL pipeline. In parallel, curriculum methods reframed task difficulty as a learnable object: Reverse Curriculum Generation (Florensa et al., 2017) shaped start-state distributions, while PAIRED (Dennis et al., 2020) cast environment design as an adversarial game that yields emergent curricula and transferable policies. Finally, reward learning from human preferences (Christiano et al., 2017) reduced manual reward engineering, showing that the reward component of the environment can also be learned.\nTogether, these works directly motivate the paper\u2019s thesis: scalable RL progress comes from automating the key environment levers\u2014dynamics, tasks/curricula, and rewards\u2014thereby shifting effort from manual shaping to algorithmic procedures that can generalize across diverse robotic problems.",
