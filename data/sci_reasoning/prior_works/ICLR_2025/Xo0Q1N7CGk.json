  "synthesis_narrative": "Work on artificial agents first established that training recurrent networks for path integration yields grid-like firing that supports vector-based navigation, concretely demonstrating a computational need for spatial representations with metric structure. Parallel modeling showed that training recurrent networks for spatial localization produces low-dimensional rotational dynamics on a neural manifold, linking movement to rotations in representational space. Direct neurophysiological measurements then revealed that grid-cell population activity lies on a two-dimensional torus, with the animal\u2019s motion corresponding to rotations along this manifold, grounding the manifold-rotation perspective in data. Earlier normative models derived hexagonal lattices from optimization principles such as smoothness and uniform coverage via adaptation, proving that hex patterns can emerge from general optimality criteria rather than specific circuit details. From a complementary angle, predictive-map theories (successor representations) connected navigation to representations approximating environmental geometry for planning, but did not guarantee local metric fidelity. Finally, manifold learning introduced the formal problem of distance-preserving embedding, articulating how embeddings can preserve geodesic or locally Euclidean structure. Together these strands revealed both the necessity of a metric-consistent code for navigation and the existence of a two-dimensional neural manifold implementing rotations, while highlighting the absence of an explicit local-distance\u2013preserving constraint. The current work synthesizes these elements by positing a conformal isometry of physical space into neural state space and showing that optimizing for maximal local distance preservation on the neural manifold naturally yields hexagonal grid patterns, independent of specific recurrent architectures and aligned with the empirical toroidal population geometry.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the conformal isometry hypothesis as a potential explanation for the hexagonal periodic patterns in grid cell response maps. We posit that grid cell activities form a high-dimensional vector in neural space, encoding the agent's position in 2D physical space. As the agent moves, this vector rotates within a 2D manifold in the neural space, driven by a recurrent neural network. The conformal hypothesis proposes that this neural manifold is a conformal isometric embedding of 2D physical space, where local physical distance is preserved by the embedding up to a scaling factor (or unit of metric). Such distance-preserving position embedding is indispensable for path planning in navigation, especially planning local straight path segments. We conduct numerical experiments to show that this hypothesis leads to the hexagonal grid firing patterns by learning maximally distance-preserving position embedding, agnostic to the choice of the recurrent neural network.
