  "synthesis_narrative": "This work delivers \u03ba-tight lower bounds for without-replacement SGD (random reshuffling and broader permutation-based schemes) on smooth (strongly) convex finite-sum problems, specifically for arbitrary weighted average iterates. The direct intellectual lineage begins with Shamir (2016), which formalized the without-replacement/reshuffling sampling model and highlighted theoretical gaps relative to with-replacement SGD. On the upper-bound side, G\u00fcrb\u00fczbalaban\u2013Ozdaglar\u2013Parrilo (2019) and Nagaraj\u2013Jain\u2013Netrapalli (2019) provided the strongest convergence guarantees for Random Reshuffling in convex and strongly convex regimes. Their bounds\u2014especially the dependencies on the condition number \u03ba and the role of averaging\u2014set the concrete targets this paper aims to match from below; Cha\u2013Lee\u2013Yun close these gaps by constructing lower bounds that exactly meet those upper rates for weighted averages, including improved \u03ba dependencies. Methodologically, the paper\u2019s lower-bound constructions and the emphasis on the finite-sum structure are rooted in the techniques of Woodworth\u2013Srebro (2016), which established tight finite-sum oracle lower bounds and hard-instance design patterns that this work tailors to the without-replacement sampling dynamics. Finally, the paper\u2019s focus on arbitrary weighted average iterates is anchored in the averaging paradigm introduced by Polyak\u2013Juditsky (1992), with Cha\u2013Lee\u2013Yun showing that, even with optimally chosen weights and permutations, one cannot beat the presented bounds\u2014thereby precisely delineating the limits of reshuffling and permutation-based SGD.",
