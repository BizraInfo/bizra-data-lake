  "synthesis_narrative": "Transformers as diffusion denoisers were shown to scale and train efficiently in latent space by DiT, which established a ViT-style backbone and an ImageNet-centric pretraining recipe for learning strong image priors with patch tokens. Latent Diffusion introduced operating in a VAE latent space and injected conditioning via cross-attention, a combination that drastically cut training cost while enabling high-resolution synthesis. GLIDE provided the concrete text-conditioning and sampling paradigm\u2014cross-attention with classifier-free guidance\u2014in a diffusion setting, demonstrating how captions can steer denoising effectively. Imagen revealed that pairing diffusion with a strong frozen language model yields markedly better text-image alignment and photorealism, albeit with prohibitive compute through large cascades. SDXL refined latent diffusion at scale for 1024px images, setting the open benchmark for realism and alignment but reinforcing the heavy compute footprint needed for near-commercial quality. ControlNet showed that one can preserve a pretrained image prior and later attach condition-specific modules initialized to minimally perturb the base, enabling decoupled optimization of content versus controls. Taken together, these works suggest a path: use a DiT backbone in latent space for efficiency, employ cross-attention for text conditioning, and decouple objectives. Building on this, the new model first learns pixel dependencies as a strong prior, then adds text-alignment modules inspired by minimally invasive conditioning, and finally fine-tunes for aesthetic quality\u2014synthesizing SDXL/Imagen-level realism while substantially reducing training cost.",

This paper introduces PixArt-$\\alpha$, a Transformer-based T2I diffusion model whose image generation quality is competitive with state-of-the-art image generators (e.g., Imagen, SDXL, and even Midjourney), reaching near-commercial application standards. Additionally, it supports high-resolution image synthesis up to 1024px resolution with low training cost, as shown in Figure 1 and 2. To achieve this goal, three core designs are proposed: (1) Training strategy decomposition: We devise three distinct training steps that separately optimize pixel dependency, text-image alignment, and image aesthetic quality; (2) Efficient T2I Transformer: We incorporate cross-attention modules into Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to inject text conditions and streamline the computation-intensive cl",
