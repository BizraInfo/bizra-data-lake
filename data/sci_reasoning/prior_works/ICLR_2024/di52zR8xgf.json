  "synthesis_narrative": "Latent Diffusion Models showed that shifting diffusion to a compressed latent space with cross-attention enables high-resolution image synthesis under practical compute, but their 512-oriented setup left room for richer detail and text alignment at larger scales. Cascaded Diffusion Models established that decomposing generation into stages, with later modules specialized for high-frequency detail, can yield strong fidelity, while SR3 made this concrete for super\u2011resolution with diffusion-based refiners. GLIDE demonstrated effective text-conditional diffusion with upsampler cascades and practical image editing via noising\u2013denoising, providing an operational recipe for post-hoc improvements. SDEdit formalized image-to-image diffusion by adding noise to an existing image and denoising it to refine content without changing structure. Imagen advanced the field by coupling a much stronger language encoder with a cascaded pipeline to reach 1024\u00d71024 photorealism, highlighting that capacity in the text encoder is pivotal for prompt faithfulness.\n\nTogether, these works revealed a path: keep the efficiency of latent diffusion, but borrow the multi-stage refinement strategy and image-to-image denoising recipe to boost detail, and increase language capacity to improve text grounding. SDXL synthesizes these insights by scaling the latent U\u2011Net (more attention), introducing a second text encoder to strengthen language conditioning, training across multiple aspect ratios to broaden coverage, and adding a latent-space refiner applied as an SDEdit-style post-hoc denoising pass. This combination closes the fidelity gap at high resolutions without resorting to heavy pixel-space super\u2011resolution chains, making high-quality 1024\u00d7 images feasible within the latent diffusion framework.",

    "abstract": "We present Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), a latent diffusion model for text-to-image synthesis. Compared to previous versions of Stable Diffusion, SDXL leverages a three times larger UNet backbone, achieved by significantly increasing the number of attention blocks and including a second text encoder. Further, we design multiple novel conditioning schemes and train SDXL on multiple aspect ratios. To ensure highest quality results, we also introduce a refinement model which is used to improve the visual fidelity of samples generated by SDXL using a post-hoc image-to-image technique. We demonstrate that SDXL improves dramatically over previous versions of Stable Diffusion and achieves results competitive with those of black-box state-of-the-art image generators such as Midjourney.",
