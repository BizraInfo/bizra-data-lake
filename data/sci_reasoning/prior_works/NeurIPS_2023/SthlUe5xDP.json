  "synthesis_narrative": "Topological Parallax positions a trained model and a reference dataset as two closely related metric spaces on the same point cloud: the original data metric and a model-induced, possibly distorted, geodesic metric. Converting these metrics into Vietoris\u2013Rips filtrations and comparing their persistent homology requires two pillars: that Rips captures the manifold\u2019s multiscale topology and that these summaries behave stably under metric perturbations. Latschev\u2019s result justifies using Rips to approximate manifold topology at appropriate scales, while Niyogi\u2013Smale\u2013Weinberger provides statistical assurance that finite samples recover the correct homology. The robustness of the parallax comparison follows from the stability of persistence diagrams (Cohen-Steiner\u2013Edelsbrunner\u2013Harer) and, more specifically for geometric complexes, from Chazal\u2013de Silva\u2013Oudot\u2019s stability theorems, which ensure that small metric distortions yield small changes in Rips-based persistence. Chazal\u2013Cohen-Steiner\u2013Guibas\u2013M\u00e9moli\u2013Oudot further anchor the approach by showing that persistence signatures can be made stable with respect to Gromov\u2013Hausdorff perturbations, aligning directly with parallax\u2019s goal of using topology as a geometry-sensitive specification. Computationally, estimating geodesic distances on sampled data is informed by Isomap\u2019s graph-geodesic framework, enabling a practical proxy for the intrinsic metric whose distortion by the model is under scrutiny. Finally, M\u00e9moli\u2019s Gromov\u2013Wasserstein viewpoint motivates comparing spaces via correspondences and distortion, conceptually framing parallax as a topological, multiscale instantiation of metric-space comparison that tests whether a model preserves the dataset\u2019s intrinsic geometry essential for trustworthy interpolation and perturbation.",
