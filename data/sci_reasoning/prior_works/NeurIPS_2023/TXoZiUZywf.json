  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014tighter confidence sequences for stochastic linear bandits obtained from a novel tail bound for adaptive martingale mixtures\u2014sits squarely at the intersection of two threads: optimism-based linear bandits and time-uniform concentration via mixture martingales. The optimism framework of Dani\u2013Hayes\u2013Kakade (2008) and Abbasi-Yadkori\u2013P\u00e1l\u2013Szepesv\u00e1ri (2011) showed that linear bandit regret hinges on the size of confidence sets around least-squares estimates; OFUL\u2019s self-normalized ellipsoids became the standard, with convex optimization naturally delivering action selection. Chu et al. (2011) further operationalized this blueprint (LinUCB), cementing the practical link between confidence regions and efficient convex decision rules.\n\nParallel advances in sequential inference\u2014especially the confidence-sequence program of Howard et al. (2021) and the mixture-martingale/e-process toolkit refined by Kaufmann & Koolen (2021)\u2014demonstrated that mixing supermartingales yields sharp, anytime-valid bounds robust to adaptivity and optional stopping. The present paper fuses these strands by tailoring mixture-martingale tail bounds to the adaptive, vector-valued setting of linear regression under bandit feedback, thereby producing confidence sequences that are uniformly valid over time yet tighter than classical self-normalized ones. These improved sets drop directly into the OFU/convex-programming pipeline established by earlier linear bandit work, preserving computational tractability while strengthening worst-case regret guarantees. Rusmevichientong & Tsitsiklis (2010) reinforce the convex-optimization viewpoint rooted in ellipsoidal uncertainty, further contextualizing how the new confidence sets translate into efficient action selection. Together, these prior works supply the algorithmic template and theoretical concentration tools that the paper refines to achieve stronger regret with smaller, anytime-valid confidence regions.",
