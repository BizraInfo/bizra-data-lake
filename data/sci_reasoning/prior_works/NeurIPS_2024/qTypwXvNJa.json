  "synthesis_narrative": "GOPSA\u2019s core contribution\u2014test-time adaptation across multiple EEG sources with differing label distributions by optimizing along geodesics on the SPD manifold\u2014sits at the intersection of three threads of prior work. First, the modeling and geometry: Barachant et al. established SPD covariance representations and geodesic-based classification (MDM) for EEG, while Arsigny et al. provided the log\u2013exp calculus and geodesic structure that make principled optimization on SPD feasible. Building on these foundations, Riemannian alignment methods for EEG (e.g., Zanini et al.) demonstrated that domain adaptation is most effective when performed intrinsically on the SPD manifold rather than via Euclidean proxies, directly motivating GOPSA\u2019s manifold-native approach.\nSecond, geodesic-domain adaptation: the Geodesic Flow Kernel (Gong et al.) introduced the idea of traversing geodesic paths between source and target domains to achieve smooth adaptation. GOPSA generalizes this idea to the SPD manifold of EEG covariances, using geodesic operations to interpolate and optimize between multiple source models.\nThird, predictive/label-shift handling: classical prior-shift correction (Saerens et al.) and modern black-box label-shift estimation (Lipton et al.) formalize how changing p(y) distorts predictions, while multi-source target-shift optimal transport (Courty et al.) shows how to reconcile sources with different class proportions. GOPSA integrates these insights by explicitly addressing heterogeneous y-distributions across sources and performing test-time geodesic optimization to align predictive behavior to the target, unifying manifold geometry with label-shift-aware multi-source adaptation.",
