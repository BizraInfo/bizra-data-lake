  "synthesis_narrative": "SViMo\u2019s key innovation is a synchronized diffusion framework that co-generates an HOI video and an explicit 3D interaction motion sequence under shared physical constraints. This builds directly on two pillars of diffusion research: video generation and motion generation. From Video Diffusion Models and Align Your Latents, SViMo adopts a latent spatiotemporal denoising backbone with cross-frame/full 3D attention to ensure coherent appearance over time. From the Human Motion Diffusion Model, it inherits the idea of modeling long-horizon 3D motion as a denoising process, which SViMo extends to hand\u2013object interactions.\n\nThe synchronization mechanism is inspired by SyncDreamer\u2019s insight that related generative processes should denoise in lockstep to preserve cross-view (or cross-stream) consistency. SViMo generalizes this principle across modalities\u2014video appearance and 3D kinematics\u2014so that what is seen matches how it moves. To fuse heterogeneous inputs, SViMo leverages Diffusion Transformers and recent conditioning advances exemplified by Control-A-Video, adopting adaptive modulation and cross-attention to align semantics, appearance, and motion signals within a unified transformer.\n\nFinally, SViMo\u2019s emphasis on physical plausibility\u2014contact patterns and interaction dynamics\u2014draws on GRAB\u2019s contact-centric priors and evaluation practices. These priors guide the vision-aware interaction diffusion branch toward realistic grasps and object-relative hand motions, addressing a limitation of prior video-only methods that optimize for visual fidelity at the expense of physics. Together, these works directly shaped SViMo\u2019s synchronized, tri-modally modulated, and physics-aware HOI generation framework.",
