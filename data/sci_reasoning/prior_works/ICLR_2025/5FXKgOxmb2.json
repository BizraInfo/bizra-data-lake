  "synthesis_narrative": "Junction Tree VAE demonstrated that composing molecules from a pre-mined vocabulary of substructures dramatically stabilizes generation, but its fixed motif inventory inherently blocks unseen chemistry. Follow-on hierarchical motif models extended this idea, decoding molecules at the motif level while explicitly acknowledging out-of-vocabulary limitations when encountering novel substructures. MoLeR positioned scaffold extension with structural motifs as a practical and scalable baseline, yet still anchored generation to a discrete fragment set mined from data. In parallel, MoFlow introduced an explicit factorization of molecular graph generation into topology followed by conditional feature assignment, showing that atom and bond types can be learned effectively given a structural context. Outside strictly graph-based models, Bemis\u2013Murcko molecular frameworks crystallized the notion of a scaffold as the topology divorced from chemical labels, while scaffold decoration systems like LibINVENT and fragment-linking approaches such as DeLinker formalized scaffold-conditioned completion as a viable design task, albeit typically with templates or string/3D-specific machinery. \n\nTaken together, these works reveal a clear opportunity: keep the strong inductive bias of operating on higher-level structure, but remove the bottleneck of fixed fragment vocabularies by separating unlabeled topology from chemical labels and learning the latter from full-graph context. MAGNet synthesizes the MoFlow-style conditional factorization with the Bemis\u2013Murcko scaffold abstraction and the scaffold-conditioned task setup of LibINVENT/DeLinker, while directly addressing the motif vocabulary gap highlighted by JT\u2011VAE, hierarchical motif decoders, and MoLeR by assigning atom and bond types over arbitrary scaffolds in a motif-agnostic manner.",

Complementary to this, we propose MAGNet, the first model to freely learn mo",
