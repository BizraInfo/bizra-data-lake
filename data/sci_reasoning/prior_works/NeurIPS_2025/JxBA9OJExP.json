  "synthesis_narrative": "DNAEdit\u2019s core insight\u2014aligning the Gaussian noise directly in the rectified-flow (RF) noise domain to reduce inversion drift\u2014emerges from two converging threads: text-guided, training-free editing and flow-based generative modeling. Flow Matching and Rectified Flow establish a velocity-field formulation in which noisy latents follow straight-line interpolations between Gaussian noise and data. This linear structure is precisely what DNAEdit exploits: instead of reconstructing by traversing (and approximating) future latents step by step, it estimates the RF velocity at each time and corrects the base noise itself to stay on the exact path.\nIn training-free editing, SDEdit and DDIM inversion popularized re-noising and deterministic ODE inversions for real-image edits, but both suffer from cumulative trajectory error when the current noisy latent is used to predict later ones. Subsequent inversion works\u2014Null-Text Inversion and Edit-Friendly DDPM Inversion\u2014explicitly tackle reconstruction drift, either via per-image optimization of guidance tokens or tailored schedules, underscoring the centrality of error accumulation in practical editing. DNAEdit addresses this same bottleneck with a different mechanism: noise-domain correction grounded in RF velocities, obviating per-image textual optimization and reducing dependence on fragile step-to-step approximations. Finally, prompt-level control methods like Prompt-to-Prompt provide semantic steering that is complementary to DNAEdit\u2019s fidelity improvements, which ensure attention-based edits are applied to accurately reconstructed latents. Together, these works directly inform DNAEdit\u2019s design: adopt RF\u2019s linear transport and velocity estimation, retain training-free text guidance, and neutralize inversion drift by aligning the Gaussian noise at each timestep.",
