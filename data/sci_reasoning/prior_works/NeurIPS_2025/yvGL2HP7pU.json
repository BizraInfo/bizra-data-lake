Kaplan et al. (2020) established general scaling laws, and Hoffmann et al. (2022) refined them with compute-optimal guidance; ProGen3 explicitly adapts these ideas to amino-acid tokens, dictating its 46B/1.5T-token training regime and enabling principled extrapolation of performance with scale. To make such scaling tractable, ProGen3 leverages sparse mixture-of-experts principles from Switch Transformers (Fedus et al., 2021), achieving high parameter counts without commensurate compute growth.\n\nOn the protein side, ProGen (Madani et al., 2020) defined the autoregressive, family-conditioned generation paradigm that ProGen3 extends, while Madani et al. (2023) provided crucial wet-lab validation that LLM-generated sequences can be functional across multiple families\u2014ProGen3 scales this lineage and uniquely studies how model size broadens viable generation across a wider taxonomic and functional space. Rives et al. (2021) showed that larger protein LMs produce stronger emergent structure/function representations, motivating ProGen3\u2019s hypothesis that scale deepens functional understanding. Finally, ProtTrans (Elnaggar et al., 2021) demonstrated the value of massive, diverse protein corpora and informed ProGen3\u2019s construction and optimized sampling of the large curated PPA v1 dataset. Together, these works directly shaped ProGen3\u2019s scaling strategy, architecture, data design, and experimental validation agenda.",
