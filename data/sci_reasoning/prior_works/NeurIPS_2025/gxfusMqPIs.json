  "synthesis_narrative": "The core advance of the paper is to prove near-optimal Bayesian regret rates for GP-UCB\u2014specifically, \u00d5(\u221aT) for Mat\u00e9rn kernels and O(\u221a(T log^2 T)) for squared exponential\u2014by refining how information gain is handled along the sequence of points actually chosen by the algorithm. This builds squarely on the original GP-UCB framework of Srinivas et al. (2012), which bounded regret via the worst-case mutual information \u03b3_T and led to extra polylogarithmic and kernel/dimension-dependent factors. The Bayesian viewpoint of Russo and Van Roy (2016) provided a clean link between regret and information, and Scarlett (2018) established the best known Bayesian upper bounds under GP priors, though not via the standard GP-UCB analysis. The present paper closes that gap by showing GP-UCB itself achieves these rates, leveraging a key idea: the selected inputs concentrate in regions that permit tighter control of cumulative information gain than worst-case \u03b3_T would suggest. Technically, this relies on classic tools tying sums of posterior variances to log-determinants/information gain (Valko et al., 2013) and on self-normalized concentration techniques developed for kernelized bandits (Chowdhury & Gopalan, 2017). Foundational submodularity and information-gain properties for Gaussian processes (Krause et al., 2008) underpin these arguments. Finally, lower bounds for GP bandits (Scarlett, Bogunovic & Cevher, 2017) set the minimax targets that the new bounds meet, demonstrating that a refined, sequence-aware analysis suffices to render GP-UCB near-optimal in the Bayesian setting.",
