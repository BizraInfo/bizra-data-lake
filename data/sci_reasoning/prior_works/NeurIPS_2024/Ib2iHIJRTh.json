  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014probabilistic emulation of a global climate model over century-scale horizons\u2014rests on fusing dynamics-informed diffusion with a spherical spectral operator backbone. At the methodological heart is DYffusion, which integrates known or learned dynamics into the diffusion denoising process to produce physically consistent stochastic forecasts. This framework supplies the blueprint for conditioning the generative model on dynamics so that uncertainty is handled probabilistically without sacrificing long-term stability.\n\nOn the architectural side, the Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) enables learning global operators directly on the sphere, preserving rotational symmetries and avoiding polar artifacts. SFNO builds on the Fourier Neural Operator paradigm, which established operator learning as a powerful approach for PDE-like systems; FourCastNet then demonstrated the practical value of FNO-based models for global weather forecasting and stable multi-step rollouts, informing architectural choices and training strategies at scale.\n\nThe generative capability itself is grounded in diffusion modeling advances\u2014DDPM and score-based SDEs\u2014which provide the denoising objectives, noise schedules, and continuous-time sampling perspectives adapted here via dynamics guidance to yield calibrated ensembles. Finally, prior demonstrations that ML components can be stably integrated into climate simulations (e.g., Brenowitz & Bretherton) guided the emphasis on physical constraints and stability diagnostics over very long horizons. Together, these works directly inform the paper\u2019s design: a dynamics-guided diffusion model implemented with a spherical operator backbone that delivers efficient, stable, and probabilistic emulation of a GCM.",
