  "synthesis_narrative": "UniteFormer\u2019s core contribution\u2014one model that natively handles node-only, edge-only, and hybrid inputs via a mixed GCN\u2013attention encoder and a parallel transformer decoder\u2014emerges from two converging threads in neural combinatorial optimization. The first thread established attention/pointer policies trained with REINFORCE for routing problems: Bello et al. introduced the policy-gradient pointer paradigm, later scaled and refined by Kool et al. with a transformer encoder\u2013decoder for TSP/CVRP. These models, while effective, largely rely on node-centric inputs, revealing a modality gap. POMO then demonstrated that parallelized decoding/rollouts substantially improve search and learning stability in routing, a principle UniteFormer adapts through a parallel decoder with query mapping.\nThe second thread concerns graph representation learning that elevates both node and edge signals. Dai et al. showed GCN-based policies are strong for CO, while Graphormer made transformers explicitly edge/structure-aware, and GPS provided a clear recipe to fuse local message passing with global attention. In parallel, edge-centric TSP solvers (e.g., Joshi et al.) proved that high-quality solutions can arise from edge-weight\u2013only inputs, underscoring the value of an edge modality. UniteFormer synthesizes these influences: it blends GCN and attention to model cross-modal node\u2013edge interactions, leverages parallel decoding for efficiency and robustness, and trains with REINFORCE while randomly sampling input types to unify modalities within a single policy that generalizes across benchmarks.",
