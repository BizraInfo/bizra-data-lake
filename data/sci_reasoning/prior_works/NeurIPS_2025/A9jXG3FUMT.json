  "synthesis_narrative": "FAPEX\u2019s key contribution\u2014a learnable fractional neural frame operator (FrNFO) that yields instantaneous amplitude and phase for robust, cross-subject seizure prediction\u2014emerges at the intersection of fractional time\u2013frequency analysis, neural frame theory, and phase-based neuro-biomarkers. The discrete fractional Fourier transform (Candan et al., 2000) furnishes the mathematical backbone for fractional-order representations, enabling rotations in the time\u2013frequency plane that FAPEX renders learnable via fractional-order convolutions. Deep Convolutional Framelets (Jin, Lee, Ye, 2017) casts CNNs as frame operators, a perspective FAPEX extends to a neural frame with fractional adaptivity, producing stable, interpretable amplitude\u2013phase features.\nCrucially, Rahaman et al. (2019) document neural networks\u2019 spectral bias toward low frequencies; FAPEX directly counters this by designing a fractional front-end that captures high-frequency preictal dynamics often missed by conventional models. Prior successes with structured, learnable front-ends from raw waveforms (Ravanelli & Bengio, 2018) further support FAPEX\u2019s decision to learn the front-end rather than rely on fixed transforms. To model long-range preictal temporal structure, FAPEX integrates structured state-space modules inspired by S4 (Gu et al., 2022), complementing spectral adaptivity with efficient sequence modeling.\nOn the neuroscience side, evidence that preictal phase synchronization and cross-frequency phase\u2013amplitude coupling are informative (Le Van Quyen et al., 2001; Tort et al., 2010) motivates FAPEX\u2019s explicit instantaneous phase and amplitude outputs, facilitating biomarker discovery and enhancing out-of-distribution generalization across subjects and modalities. Together, these works directly scaffold FAPEX\u2019s FrNFO design and its integration with temporal SSMs, yielding a principled, phase-aware, spectrally balanced architecture for SASP.",
