  "synthesis_narrative": "Tilted Sparse Additive Models (TSAM) fuse two mature lines of work\u2014sparse additive modeling and tilted risk\u2014to create a robust, imbalance-aware, yet interpretable learner. The additive modeling foundation originates from Hastie and Tibshirani\u2019s Generalized Additive Models, which established the component-wise function decomposition TSAM retains. In high dimensions, Meier\u2013van de Geer\u2013B\u00fchlmann and Ravikumar et al. advanced sparse additive estimation with l1/group-sparsity penalties and basis expansions; TSAM directly inherits this structure but replaces the standard ERM objective at the heart of these baselines. The theoretical understanding of additive function classes, notably the minimax and RKHS-based analyses of Raskutti\u2013Wainwright\u2013Yu, informs TSAM\u2019s generalization and approximation error bounds under the new risk.\n\nOn the objective side, Koenker and Bassett\u2019s Regression Quantiles introduced tilted (check) losses that explicitly emphasize certain distributional regions, a core inspiration for TERM. Lin et al.\u2019s Focal Loss further demonstrated that per-example loss modulation alleviates class imbalance, but in a task-specific manner, highlighting a gap for a general, principled formulation. Liu et al.\u2019s Tilted Empirical Risk Minimization provides that unifying formulation: a tilt operator over individual losses that yields robustness, imbalance adaptivity, and multiobjective flexibility. TSAM\u2019s key innovation is to embed TERM within the sparse additive framework, thereby marrying interpretability and variable selection with the robustness and flexibility of tilted risk, and extending both methodological practice and theory in additive modeling beyond ERM.",
