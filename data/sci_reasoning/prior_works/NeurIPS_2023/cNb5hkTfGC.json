  "synthesis_narrative": "AMenuNet\u2019s core contribution\u2014an exactly DSIC, scalable neural mechanism that learns the parameters of an affine maximizer auction including its allocation menu\u2014sits at the intersection of mechanism design theory and modern set-structured neural architectures. On the theoretical side, Vickrey\u2013Clarke\u2013Groves and Roberts\u2019 characterization together justify the paper\u2019s decision to constrain the hypothesis space to affine maximizers: within rich type domains these are precisely the DSIC, IR mechanisms, with VCG as a canonical special case. This choice directly addresses the primary limitation of the dominant learning-based baseline, RegretNet (D\u00fctting et al.), which optimizes revenue under regret penalties but only enforces incentive compatibility approximately. By adopting AMAs, AMenuNet guarantees DSIC/IR by construction while keeping the search space expressive via learned weights, reserves, and a learned allocation menu.\n\nScalability and generalization are enabled by insights from menu complexity and set-based neural modeling. Hart\u2013Nisan\u2019s results highlight why naive enumeration of large menus is computationally prohibitive, motivating AMenuNet\u2019s neural generation of a compact candidate allocation set that preserves revenue performance. To make the architecture robust to variable numbers of bidders and items and to avoid parameter growth with auction scale, AMenuNet builds on permutation-invariant/equivariant design principles from Deep Sets and Set Transformer, which provide expressive, symmetry-preserving encoders for unordered collections. Together, these works directly inform AMenuNet\u2019s design choices: restrict to AMAs for exact DSIC/IR, and use permutation-equivariant, set-based neural components to learn a compact, high-quality allocation menu that scales to larger markets.",
