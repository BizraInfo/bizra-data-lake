  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper synthesizes classical matrix approximation and perturbation theory with modern probabilistic tools and differential privacy motivations. Eckart\u2013Young (and Mirsky\u2019s extension) provides the optimality baseline for rank-p approximations, but it does not quantify how optimal solutions drift under perturbations. Davis\u2013Kahan and Wedin supply gap-dependent control of eigenvector and singular subspace rotations, forming the deterministic backbone for understanding subspace stability. Stewart and Sun\u2019s monograph consolidates these inequalities and their regimes of validity, offering a starting point the authors explicitly refine: rather than bounding angles alone or relying on Frobenius metrics, they deliver sharp spectral-norm bounds on the difference between best rank-p approximations that depend on the interaction of A and E and mild eigengap conditions.\nOn the application side, differentially private PCA and low-rank approximation works, notably Chaudhuri\u2013Sarwate\u2013Sinha and Hardt\u2013Price\u2019s noisy power method, established algorithmic paradigms and utility analyses\u2014often in reconstruction or Frobenius norms or subspace angles. These results underscore the need for worst-case, spectral-norm guarantees that certify minimal directional distortion of the top-p structure under privacy noise. Finally, Tropp\u2019s matrix concentration inequalities enable translating the new deterministic, interaction-sensitive perturbation bounds into high-probability statements for common DP noise models (e.g., Gaussian/Wigner-type perturbations). Together, these strands directly inform the paper\u2019s core contribution: high-probability, gap-aware spectral-norm perturbation bounds for low-rank approximations, tailored to both deterministic and randomized (privacy) perturbations.",
