  "synthesis_narrative": "The core contribution of Newton\u2013Cotes Graph Neural Networks is to reinterpret GNN-based simulators as performing time integration of velocities and to replace the ubiquitous single-point, constant-in-time integrand with a principled multi-point quadrature. Early dynamic GNNs such as Interaction Networks and Neural Relational Inference established the template of message passing followed by explicit discrete updates, effectively implementing an Euler step that assumes velocity is constant over each interval. Graph Network-based Simulators scaled this paradigm to complex scenes and long rollouts, further entrenching the single-point approximation. Neural Ordinary Differential Equations supplied the continuous-time lens\u2014states evolve by integrating a velocity field\u2014and highlighted that higher-order accuracy arises from evaluating the vector field at multiple intermediate times, a concept the present work adapts to GNN simulators. Classical numerical analysis, codified in Davis and Rabinowitz, provides the Newton\u2013Cotes rules (trapezoidal, Simpson, etc.) that the authors use to aggregate several velocity estimates into a higher-order integral approximation with analyzable error. Concurrently, Hamiltonian Neural Networks emphasized the importance of integrator choice for stability and long-horizon fidelity, motivating attention to the integration scheme itself rather than solely to architectural tweaks. Finally, equivariant GNNs like EGNN offer physically consistent velocity/force estimators that can be queried at multiple time nodes, making the Newton\u2013Cotes construction plug-and-play across modern simulators. Together, these works directly inform the paper\u2019s key insight: keep the interaction encoder but upgrade the time integration to a multi-point Newton\u2013Cotes rule for consistently improved accuracy.",
