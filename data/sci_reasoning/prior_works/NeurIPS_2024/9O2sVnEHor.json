  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014a loopy refinement of Weisfeiler\u2013Leman (r-\u2113WL) that enables counting cycles up to length r+2 and homomorphisms of cactus graphs\u2014builds on a convergence of WL theory, homomorphism-counting characterizations, and GNN expressivity results. Grohe\u2013Neuen\u2013Schweitzer precisely chart the power of k-WL, positioning it as the canonical hierarchy for graph isomorphism testing; this provides the formal backdrop for demonstrating r-\u2113WL\u2019s incomparability with any fixed k-WL. Dell\u2013Grohe\u2013Rattan\u2019s seminal link between 1-WL and counts of homomorphisms from trees is the conceptual hinge the authors extend: r-\u2113WL lifts the homomorphism-counting frontier from trees to cactus graphs, thereby strictly enriching the counting repertoire without resorting to higher-order WL tensors. The homomorphism basis developed by Curticapean\u2013Dell\u2013Marx justifies hom-counts as the right algebraic currency for graph statistics, guiding the selection of cactus motifs as a tractable, informative class. On the learning side, Gilmer et al.\u2019s MPNN framework and Xu et al.\u2019s GIN characterization cement the 1-WL ceiling for standard message passing, motivating architectural changes. Morris et al. show how higher-order GNNs align with k-WL, furnishing the main comparator for the new hierarchy. Finally, Shervashidze et al. demonstrate how WL refinements translate to effective learning machinery, a pathway r-\u2113MPNN follows while adding loopy refinements that provably enable cycle and cactus homomorphism counting, and empirically yield strong performance on sparse graphs.",
