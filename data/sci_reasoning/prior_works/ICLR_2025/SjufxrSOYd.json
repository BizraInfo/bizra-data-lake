  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014extending higher-order invariant graph networks to the graphon setting with Lp-approximation guarantees and k-WL-level expressivity\u2014rests on two converging lines of work. On the graph limit side, Borgs et al. (2008) and Lov\u00e1sz (2012) provide the formal infrastructure of graphons, homomorphism densities, and the cut distance; these notions are repurposed here as signal-weighted homomorphism densities and as the metric foundation for approximation and transferability claims. B\u00f6ker (2023) brings the Weisfeiler\u2013Leman hierarchy to graphons; the present paper directly extends this to incorporate node signals and uses it as the expressivity yardstick to show that k-order IWNs match k-WL on graphons. On the higher-order GNN side, Maron et al. (2019) introduced Invariant Graph Networks and their linear basis; this work defines Invariant Graphon Networks by selecting the subset of basis elements corresponding to bounded operators in the graphon space. Maron et al. (2019, Provably Powerful) links higher-order networks to k-WL on finite graphs, a relationship this paper transposes to graphons. Keriven and Peyr\u00e9 (2019) provide universal approximation blueprints for invariant/equivariant mappings, which inform the Lp-universality proofs in the graphon-signal setting. Finally, Cai and Wang (2022) identify and analyze the restricted IGN-small class; this paper both closes a gap\u2014showing an even smaller bounded-operator subset retains comparable power\u2014and extends that expressivity theory from finite graphs to graphons.",
