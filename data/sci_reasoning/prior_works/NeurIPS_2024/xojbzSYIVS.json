  "synthesis_narrative": "LLM-ESR\u2019s core contribution is to mitigate long-tail user and item challenges in sequential recommendation by injecting large language model semantics into a Transformer-based SRS. Foundationally, SASRec and BERT4Rec established the effectiveness of Transformer architectures and language-modeling paradigms for capturing user behavior dynamics, providing the architectural and representational substrate that LLM-ESR enhances. On the sparsity front, S3-Rec showed that auxiliary semantics and self-supervision can bolster sequential models under limited interactions, while DeepCoNN earlier demonstrated that textual content can effectively compensate for cold-start and long-tail data\u2014principles LLM-ESR amplifies using richer LLM-derived signals.\nUniSRec further advanced generalization by aligning ID and textual representations, offering a direct blueprint for leveraging semantic encoders to address unseen or rarely interacted items; LLM-ESR extends this idea with stronger LLM semantics for both users and items in sequence contexts. Meanwhile, P5 validated the broader potential of pretrained language models for recommendation, motivating LLM-ESR\u2019s decision to harness LLM knowledge as an enhancement layer rather than fully replacing ranking architectures. Finally, CL4SRec\u2019s contrastive denoising informed LLM-ESR\u2019s attention to the seesaw/noise issues inherent in tail regimes, guiding robustness-oriented integration of semantic augmentation. Together, these works converge on the insight that pairing strong sequential backbones with semantically grounded, LM-powered signals is key to overcoming long-tail sparsity and noise in real-world SRS.",
