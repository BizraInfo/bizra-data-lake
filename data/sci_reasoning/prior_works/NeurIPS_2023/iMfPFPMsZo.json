  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation in Parallel Submodular Function Minimization is to obtain new query-versus-depth trade-offs for exact SFM, including a depth-2 algorithm with n^{O(M)} queries and a poly-query algorithm with depth ~ n^{1/3} M^{2/3}, by exploiting the convex structure of the Lov\u00e1sz extension in a geometry tailored to \u2113\u221e. Lov\u00e1sz\u2019s seminal reduction of SFM to convex minimization over the hypercube is the conceptual linchpin, as it both justifies a continuous approach and reveals bounded-range submodular functions as \u2113\u221e-Lipschitz. Classic sequential milestones\u2014Schrijver, Iwata\u2013Fleischer\u2013Fujishige, and Orlin\u2014form the dominant algorithmic lineage the paper moves beyond: rather than optimizing sequential time, it targets minimal adaptivity (depth) under oracle access.\nA second influential strand is the use of convex-analytic tools for SFM, epitomized by the cutting-plane breakthroughs of Lee\u2013Sidford\u2013Wong, which underscored the power of continuous relaxations. On the convex optimization side, the oracle-complexity framework of Nemirovski\u2013Yudin (and mirror/subgradient methods in \u21131/\u2113\u221e geometry) provides both algorithmic scaffolding and near-optimality yardsticks for black-box Lipschitz minimization. Prior highly-parallel reductions to SFM predominantly flowed through \u21132-Lipschitz convex minimization (e.g., Nesterov\u2013Spokoiny\u2019s gradient-free schemes), which are naturally parallelizable but misaligned with the \u2113\u221e Lipschitzness inherent to Lov\u00e1sz extensions. By designing the first highly-parallel minimization algorithm tailored to \u2113\u221e-Lipschitz objectives on the hypercube, the paper closes this geometric gap and, together with the convex reduction, yields its improved depth\u2013query trade-offs for SFM.",
