  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core idea\u2014imposing equivariance on arbitrary base models by learning a probabilistic symmetrization distribution\u2014fuses classical group-averaging with modern equivariant design and universality theory. Cohen and Welling\u2019s G-CNN introduced group convolution and pooling as Haar-based symmetrization, establishing that averaging over group actions yields equivariant/invariant mappings. Building on the representation-theoretic formalization of equivariance as intertwiners (Kondor & Trivedi), the paper keeps the symmetrization principle but replaces fixed Haar averaging with a learnable distribution parameterized by a small equivariant network. This innovation targets the practical limitations of specialized architectures such as steerable CNNs (Weiler & Cesa) and 3D tensor-field/attention models (Thomas et al.; Fuchs et al.), which hard-wire group structure into layers and restrict base architectures and pretrained initialization.\n\nBy learning the sampling distribution for group elements, the method reduces the sample complexity of Monte Carlo symmetrization while preserving equivariance in expectation, enabling architecture-agnostic retrofitting of MLPs and transformers (including pretrained ViTs). On the theory side, universality results for permutation-invariant/equivariant functions (Deep Sets; Maron et al.) connect to the paper\u2019s guarantee that any target equivariant function can be approximated in expectation via probabilistic symmetrization of a sufficiently expressive base model. Together, these strands\u2014group averaging for equivariance, representation-theoretic characterizations, and universality of permutation-symmetric models\u2014directly inform a framework that preserves symmetry rigor while remaining flexible, data-efficient, and compatible with modern, pretrained architectures.",
