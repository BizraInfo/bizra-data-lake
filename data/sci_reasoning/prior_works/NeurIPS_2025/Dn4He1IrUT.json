  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014deriving explicit convergence rates for constrained expected improvement (CEI)\u2014sits at the intersection of three strands of prior work. First, Jones et al. (1998) introduced expected improvement within GP-based Bayesian optimization, establishing the improvement-based sampling principle and surrogate modeling assumptions that CEI inherits. The constrained analogue of this principle was operationalized a decade later: Gelbart et al. (2014) proposed CEI as EI scaled by the probability of feasibility, and Gardner et al. (2014) provided a broader CBO framework with GP models per constraint, solidifying the acquisition structure and independence assumptions that the present analysis adopts.\nSecond, the methodology for proving rates traces directly to the unconstrained EI literature. Vazquez and Bect (2010) supplied baseline global convergence arguments for EI, while Bull (2011) delivered sharp simple-regret rates under RKHS/Mat\u00e9rn smoothness via interpolation error bounds and fill-distance arguments. The current paper generalizes Bull\u2019s blueprint to the constrained setting, controlling the interaction between the EI term and feasibility probabilities to recover Mat\u00e9rn-dependent O(t^{-\u03bd/(2\u03bd+d)}) rates and to quantify the logarithmic factors.\nThird, for the GP-sampled function regime and the squared exponential kernel, the analysis leverages information-theoretic and concentration tools from GP bandits (Srinivas et al., 2010), which provide posterior variance control and kernel-dependent complexity measures. Combining these ingredients yields the stated O(t^{-1/2} log^{(d+1)/2} t) rate for the SE kernel and extends rate guarantees to the CEI setting that previously lacked theoretical characterization.",
