  "synthesis_narrative": "The core contribution\u2014unsupervised model-based pretraining from pixels coupled with a task-aware fine-tuning strategy using a new hybrid planner, Dyna-MPC\u2014emerges from a convergence of the URLB problem setting and advances in world-model RL and value-regularized planning. URLB defined the exact protocol and exposed that existing unsupervised methods often fail to improve generalization in visual control, setting the target this work aims to solve. Dreamer provided the key capability to learn controllable latent dynamics from pixels, which this paper adopts for unsupervised pretraining. Plan2Explore showed that unsupervised world-model exploration can transfer across tasks but struggled on URLB; that shortfall directly motivates this paper\u2019s stronger adaptation stage. On the planning side, PlaNet established latent-space MPC with learned dynamics, while TD-MPC demonstrated that blending MPC with a learned value function yields robust image-based control; Dyna-MPC extends this idea by integrating Dyna-style model rollouts to update value/policy during fine-tuning. Finally, CIC serves as the principal model-free unsupervised baseline within URLB that this method decisively outperforms, reinforcing the necessity of model-based pretraining and hybrid planning. Together, these works form the direct intellectual lineage that enables mastering URLB from pixels.",
