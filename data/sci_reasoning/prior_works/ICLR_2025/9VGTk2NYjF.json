  "synthesis_narrative": "Continuous Local Search delineates a complexity class for continuous potential-driven problems and provides a reduction template that captures stationary-point computations; this framework underpins arguments that equilibrium computation can be as hard as finding first-order critical points. End of Potential Line refines this perspective with a canonical complete problem and practical gadgets for encoding potential improvements along discrete paths, offering a versatile engine for CLS-hardness reductions. Team-maxmin equilibria formalize games with teams of identical interests that act independently, clarifying how a team\u2019s inability to correlate constrains feasible strategies and equilibrium notions. Graphical Models for Game Theory introduces the pairwise interaction structure that polymatrix games instantiate, enabling edge-wise decomposition into distinct bilateral interactions. Finally, work establishing the tractability of zero-sum polymatrix games identifies a notable efficient frontier: multi-player settings remain solvable when every edge is antagonistic. Alongside this, hardness for three-team polymatrix games shows where tractability breaks down, explicitly posing the two-team case as an open complexity gap. Together, these works set the stage: the graphical/polymatrix format specifies the model, team-maxmin defines independent teams, and zero-sum tractability marks the baseline, while CLS/EOPL provide the hardness machinery. The remaining gap\u2014two-team games mixing coordination and zero-sum edges, and the special case with independent adversaries\u2014naturally invites a CLS-focused reduction proving hardness yet revealing tight tractability boundaries for the independent-adversary variant.",

    "abstract": "Adversarial multiplayer games are an important object of study in multiagent learning. In particular, polymatrix zero-sum games are a multiplayer setting where Nash equilibria are known to be efficiently computable. Towards understanding the limits of tractability in polymatrix games, we study the computation of Nash equilibria in such games where each pair of players plays either a zero-sum or a coordination game. We are particularly interested in the setting where players can be grouped into a small number of teams of identical interest. While the three-team version of the problem is known to be PPAD-complete, the complexity for two teams has remained open. Our main contribution is to prove that the two-team version remains hard, namely it is CLS-hard. Furthermore, we show that this lower bound is tight for the setting where one of the teams consists of multiple independent adversaries. On the way to obtaining our main result, we prove hardness of finding any stationary point in the ",
