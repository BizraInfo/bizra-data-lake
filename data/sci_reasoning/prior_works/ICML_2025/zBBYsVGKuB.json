  "synthesis_narrative": "Cross-environment Cooperation (CEC) sits at the intersection of zero-shot coordination, ad hoc teamwork, and generalization via procedural diversity. The ZSC literature, crystallized by Other-Play and Fictitious Co-Play, defined the core goal and evaluation via cross-play: train agents that coordinate with independently trained partners. However, these techniques typically target a single game and rely on symmetry randomization or partner-belief modeling within that fixed setting. In parallel, the Hanabi challenge foregrounded human-compatible cooperation, highlighting the gap between self-play specialists and agents that collaborate well with unfamiliar teammates.\n\nFrom the RL generalization side, Procgen demonstrated that procedural task diversity curbs overfitting and yields transferable representations, while open-ended learning in XLand showed that multi-task curricula can produce broadly capable agents. The ad hoc teamwork paradigm provided the overarching objective\u2014performing with unknown partners\u2014emphasizing robustness to partner variation rather than joint overfitting. Earlier methods like LOLA illustrated how shaping learning dynamics can foster cooperation, yet did not directly address generalization to novel partners and tasks.\n\nCEC synthesizes these threads: it replaces single-task specialization with large-scale procedural diversity, but in a cooperative multi-agent regime explicitly aimed at ZSC. By training with a single partner across many solvable coordination challenges, CEC induces general norms that transfer to many new partners on many new problems, bridging the gap between ZSC algorithms and open-ended generalization, and validating benefits with real human collaborators.",
