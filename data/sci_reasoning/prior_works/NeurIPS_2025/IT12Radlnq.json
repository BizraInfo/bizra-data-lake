  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014two-stage learning that jointly synthesizes a stabilizing neural controller and a Lyapunov function with reduced conservatism\u2014sits at the confluence of region-of-attraction theory, iterative certified expansion, and modern neural verification. Zubov\u2019s classical characterization of the region of attraction provides the theoretical basis for treating the RoA boundary as a level set of a value-like function; this motivates the paper\u2019s Zubov-inspired sampling that preferentially targets stability boundaries rather than relying on uniform or heuristic sampling. Giesl\u2019s computational work on approximating Zubov-type Lyapunov functions demonstrates the feasibility of numerically capturing these boundary structures, informing the learnable surrogate used here.\n\nTo reduce conservatism and efficiently cover the RoA, the paper adopts an iterative domain expansion paradigm reminiscent of LQR-Trees: it grows the certified region by sampling near current boundaries and re-verifying, but now in the setting of neural controllers and learned Lyapunov certificates. Prior learning-based control with Lyapunov guarantees, exemplified by Berkenkamp et al., established how data-driven policies can be coupled with stability certificates and safe expansion, which this work extends to a joint NN policy\u2013certificate training pipeline.\n\nFinally, the paper departs from earlier continuous-time neural control works that rely on SMT solvers like dReal and Reluplex to check Lyapunov conditions\u2014approaches that often limit scalability. By leveraging bound-propagation neural verification methods (e.g., CROWN-IBP) and extending them to continuous-time Lyapunov decrease checks, the authors replace SMT with scalable NN verification, enabling practical training-time certification over expanding domains.",
