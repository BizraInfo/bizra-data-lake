  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014transferring super cliques between differently rooted clique trees to reuse UCCG computations\u2014stands squarely on two pillars: the Clique-Picking baseline and the established graphical foundations of CPDAGs and clique trees. Andersson, Madigan, and Perlman (1997) provided the essential-graph formulation and the key fact that undirected chain components are chordal, enabling a clique-tree (junction-tree) view of each component. Building on this, Meek\u2019s (1995) orientation rules and Dor\u2013Tarsi\u2019s (1992) consistent extension procedure supply the concrete mechanics by which choosing a root clique induces further compelled orientations and splits the graph into unresolved undirected components\u2014the very computations that are repeatedly invoked in Clique-Picking.\n\nWien\u00f6bst et al. (2023) operationalized these ideas into a polynomial-time counting algorithm by iteratively selecting root cliques and generating UCCGs, but left a computational inefficiency: recomputation of similar structures for different roots. The present work addresses that gap by borrowing insights from clique-tree inference. Lauritzen\u2013Spiegelhalter (1988) and Jensen\u2013Lauritzen\u2013Olesen (1990) showed that re-rooting a clique tree allows reuse of local summaries. Translating this to MEC-size counting, the authors define super cliques\u2014transferable summaries over the rooted clique tree\u2014so the effects of one root choice can be efficiently repurposed for another. Thus, the paper directly extends the Clique-Picking framework with junction-tree re-rooting principles to cut redundant UCCG generation, particularly when the number of cliques is much smaller than the number of vertices.",
