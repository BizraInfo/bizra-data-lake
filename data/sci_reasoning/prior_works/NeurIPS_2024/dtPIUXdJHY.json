  "synthesis_narrative": "Zhang and Zhang\u2019s contribution hinges on reformulating generalization analysis for multi-label learning when representations are label-specific rather than shared. The foundational backbone is the Rademacher-complexity framework of Bartlett and Mendelson, which enables capacity control via data-dependent complexities. However, classical contraction tools for scalar outputs are insufficient for multi-output settings; thus, Maurer\u2019s vector-contraction inequality becomes the immediate antecedent. Building on this, the authors craft a new vector-contraction inequality tailored to LSRL, explicitly removing the coupling across label components that prior multi-output analyses retained. This shift addresses a central limitation highlighted by prior multi-label theory: seminal works by Elisseeff and Weston and by Dembczy\u0144ski et al. showed how common losses and formulations implicitly couple labels, yielding bounds that deteriorate with the number of labels. Complementary insights from multi-task learning theory, particularly Maurer\u2013Pontil\u2013Romera-Paredes on shared-representation benefits and dependencies, further motivate decoupling as a route to milder label-number dependence. Recent deep-learning generalization results, such as Golowich\u2013Rakhlin\u2013Shamir, demonstrated the power of vector-contraction techniques for multi-output networks and inform the technical apparatus adapted here. Finally, representative LSRL architectures like CAML operationalize label-wise representations in practice, providing canonical targets for the paper\u2019s method-specific bounds. Together, these strands directly shape the paper\u2019s key innovation: an LSRL-specific contraction principle enabling generalization bounds with provably weaker label dependence and applicability across typical label-specific representation methods.",
