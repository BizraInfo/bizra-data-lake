  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014phase-aware, compositional diffusion for long-horizon motion with smooth clip-to-clip continuity\u2014builds on three converging lines of work. First, diffusion-based motion synthesis (MDM) showed that denoising diffusion can generate high-fidelity, semantically aligned 3D motion under text/action guidance, while latent-space variants like MotionDiffuse established the advantages of operating in a learned motion embedding for controllability and robustness. Second, research on phase-conditioned motion control, epitomized by Phase-Functioned Neural Networks, revealed that explicit phase variables capture periodic dynamics and stabilize transitions\u2014an idea the paper generalizes by learning a phase/frequency latent (ACT-PAE) and injecting phase cues directly into the diffusion trajectory via SPDM and TPDM. Third, the challenge of composing multi-action sequences with seamless boundaries was crystallized by TEACH and, historically, by Motion Graphs, which sought compatible transition states for clip stitching. Rather than discrete stitching or post-hoc blending, the proposed approach integrates transition awareness into the generative process itself. Conceptually, it echoes composable diffusion in vision by fusing multiple conditions\u2014here, within-clip semantics and adjacent-clip phase details\u2014through progressive guidance. The result is a principled mechanism that marries diffusion\u2019s expressivity with phase-informed priors, enabling variable-length, multi-clip motions with substantially improved dynamical continuity at transitions.",
