  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014multi-track message passing that separates and independently propagates messages by category semantics\u2014sits at the intersection of two problem lines: oversmoothing and oversquashing. Foundational analyses of oversmoothing (Li et al., Oono & Suzuki) established that standard aggregation mechanisms perform Laplacian smoothing and lose expressive power with depth, directly motivating an architecture that preserves discriminative information rather than mixing it away. In parallel, the oversquashing literature (Alon & Yahav) framed long-range dependency failures as a message bottleneck problem, suggesting the need to increase effective capacity for parallel information streams; the proposed multi-track channels operationalize this by carrying distinct semantic flows.\nArchitecturally, prior designs that preserve multi-path information flow influenced the approach. JK-Net showed that retaining and selectively combining layer-wise signals mitigates homogenization, while APPNP demonstrated that decoupling transformation from carefully controlled propagation enables long-range information transmission without excessive smoothing. For heterophily specifically, Geom-GCN highlighted the benefit of respecting structural or semantic distinctions rather than naively mixing neighbors, guiding the paper\u2019s decision to route by category semantics to prevent heterophilic mixing. Finally, R-GCN provided a direct precedent for multi-channel message passing by relation type; the present work generalizes that principle from fixed edge relations to learned category-semantic tracks. Together, these strands converge into a design that both enhances long-distance information flow and preserves separation conditions, addressing oversmoothing and oversquashing through semantics-aware, parallel message routing.",
