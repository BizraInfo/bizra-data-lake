  "synthesis_narrative": "Invariant Causal Prediction established that the true causal predictors are those whose conditional relationship to outcomes remains stable across interventions and environments, laying a formal basis for targeting invariances in prediction. Invariant Risk Minimization operationalized this idea as an objective but depended on known environments and proved brittle on complex data. Environment Inference for Invariant Learning relaxed this dependency by learning pseudo-environments from data so invariance could be imposed without annotations. Concurrently, VideoMAE demonstrated that masked spatio-temporal reconstruction can be a powerful self-supervised signal that highlights which patches carry most of the information for downstream tasks. CutMix showed that patch-level, localized modifications act like interventions that can regularize models by decoupling objects from context, though it does so randomly and without causal guidance. In climate and other real-world temporal systems, PCMCI revealed that causal dependencies are sparse, structured, and lagged, implying one should localize causal sources in space-time rather than rely on holistic correlational patterns. Graph WaveNet exemplified strong spatio-temporal forecasting architectures that nonetheless are vulnerable to distribution shifts and data sparsity. Together these works point to a path: use masked self-supervision to expose which spatio-temporal regions are truly informative (and likely causal), then create pseudo-environments via localized interventions that specifically perturb non-causal context, and finally train forecasting backbones under these interventions to enforce invariance. This synthesis naturally yields a two-stage framework that first discovers causal regions and then updates models with interventional samples, improving generalization under sensor sparsity and shifting spatio-temporal conditions.",

    "abstract": "Spatio-temporal (ST) prediction plays a pivotal role in earth sciences, such as meteorological prediction, urban computing. Adequate high-quality data, coupled with deep models capable of inference, are both indispensable and prerequisite for achieving meaningful results. However, the sparsity of data and the high costs associated with deploying sensors lead to significant data imbalances. Models that are overly tailored and lack causal relationships further compromise the generalizabilities of inference methods. Towards this end, we first establish a causal concept for ST predictions, named  NuwaDynamics, which targets to identify causal regions in data and endow model with causal reasoning ability in a two-stage process. Concretely, we initially leverage upstream self-supervision to discern causal important patches, imbuing the model with generalized information and conducting informed interventions on complementary trivial patches to extrapolate potential test distributions.
