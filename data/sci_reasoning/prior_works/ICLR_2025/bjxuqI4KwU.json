  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s contribution sits at the intersection of linear causal discovery, latent-variable identifiability, and independent component analysis (ICA). LiNGAM established that linear acyclic structural models are identifiable when errors are non-Gaussian, inaugurating the use of distributional asymmetries to break Markov-equivalence barriers. Latent LiNGAM extended this insight to models with unobserved confounders, showing that non-Gaussian latent factors can still render the system identifiable. The probabilistic backbone of these results traces to the Darmois\u2013Skitovich theorem (Kagan\u2013Linnik\u2013Rao), which guarantees that non-Gaussian independent components are recoverable from linear mixtures, and to Comon\u2019s ICA identifiability theory, which formalizes recovery of the mixing matrix up to permutation and scaling provided the number of sources does not exceed the number of observations.\n\nThe present paper integrates these strands and fills a key gap: it proves identifiability when some components are Gaussian\u2014specifically, when additive noise is Gaussian but confounders are non-Gaussian\u2014under a natural dimensionality condition (confounders \u2264 observed) and with known causal structure. This relies on noisy-ICA identifiability (Eriksson\u2013Koivunen), which shows that additive Gaussian noise does not undermine recovery of non-Gaussian sources. It also clarifies the failure mode in the all-Gaussian case, aligning with classic rotational indeterminacy in Gaussian factor analysis (Anderson\u2013Rubin). Finally, by quantifying a finite n! model ambiguity when the causal structure is unknown, the paper makes precise the permutation indeterminacy inherited from ICA, and further contributes by analytically identifying the shared joint PDF of the confounders across this finite equivalence class.",
