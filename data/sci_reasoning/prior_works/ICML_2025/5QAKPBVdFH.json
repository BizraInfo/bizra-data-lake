  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation is to redefine sharpness for transformers on a quotient manifold that removes symmetry-induced degeneracies, and to operationalize this via Riemannian geometry. This idea is catalyzed by two lines of prior work. First, the sharpness\u2013generalization paradigm (Foret et al., SAM) showed that worst-case loss within a local neighborhood can improve generalization, and subsequent analyses (Andriushchenko & Flammarion) clarified SAM\u2019s first-order nature and the role of metric choices\u2014planting the seed that different geometries produce different \"sharpness\" notions and adaptive variants. Second, a body of research revealed that naive flatness is parameterization-dependent: Dinh et al. demonstrated that rescalings can arbitrarily alter sharpness without changing the function, while Git Re-Basin exhibited wide permutation symmetries in modern networks, directly relevant to multi-head attention. Earlier invariance-aware ideas like Path-SGD highlighted that geometry should factor out reparameterization symmetries. To resolve these issues principledly, the paper adopts the Riemannian/quotient-manifold toolkit of Absil et al., defining sharpness via geodesic balls on the symmetry-quotiented parameter space. This both removes spurious directions and aligns sharpness with function-level changes. Finally, connecting to Amari\u2019s information geometry, the authors show that first-order approximations of quotient-geodesics yield practical, metric-aware sharpness measures\u2014recovering existing adaptive variants in the process. Together, these works directly motivate and technically enable a symmetry-corrected, Riemannian formulation of sharpness for transformers.",
