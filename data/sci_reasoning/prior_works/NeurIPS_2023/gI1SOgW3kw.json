  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014general identifiability of nonlinear ICA under undercompleteness, partial sparsity, dependence, and flexible grouping\u2014builds on a progression from impossibility to structured recoverability. Hyv\u00e4rinen and colleagues\u2019 classic impossibility result established that unsupervised nonlinear ICA cannot be identified without additional structure, catalyzing two main lines of work: auxiliary-variable approaches and structural constraints. Auxiliary-variable methods such as Time-Contrastive Learning and iVAE reintroduced identifiability by leveraging nonstationarity or observed conditioning, but they require side information. In contrast, the authors\u2019 prior work on structural sparsity showed that identifiability can be achieved purely from sparse source\u2013observation connectivity in unsupervised settings, albeit under bijective mixing and fully independent sources.\nThis paper generalizes that structural route in three directions. First, inspired by sparsity-based blind source separation in underdetermined regimes, it relaxes bijectivity and allows undercomplete settings and partial sparsity. Second, drawing on Independent Subspace Analysis, it moves beyond fully independent sources to grouped structures with within-group dependence. Third, echoing early post-nonlinear identifiability, it broadens the space of structural constraints from specific parametric forms to flexible connectivity assumptions. Together, these influences yield new identifiability results that subsume earlier structurally sparse nonlinear ICA, bridging gaps between auxiliary-variable identifiability, sparse underdetermined separation, and grouped-source models to better match practical, non-ideal mixing conditions.",
