  "synthesis_narrative": "CycleNet\u2019s core contribution\u2014Residual Cycle Forecasting (RCF) with learnable recurrent cycles followed by residual prediction\u2014sits at the intersection of classic decomposition and modern periodicity-aware deep models. Foundationally, STL and Prophet established that explicitly modeling seasonality and then forecasting the residual is robust and interpretable. N-BEATS advanced this decomposition paradigm in neural form, using backcast/forecast residual stacks and basis expansions for trend/seasonality, showing that component-wise modeling plus residual refinement can scale to deep learning.\nModern LTSF models reinforced the centrality of periodic dependencies. Autoformer introduced autocorrelation to uncover repeating structures and coupled it with series decomposition, while FEDformer captured seasonality in the frequency domain. TimesNet further emphasized multi-periodicity by learning local-global periodic patterns via a 2D temporal view. These works collectively argue that long-horizon accuracy hinges on capturing periodic structures explicitly.\nCycleNet synthesizes these insights but opts for a minimalistic, plug-and-play implementation: it directly parameterizes periodicity as learnable recurrent cycles (instead of attention or spectral modules) and performs forecasting on the residual, akin to STL/Prophet/N-BEATS. The efficiency and simplicity are aligned with DLinear\u2019s revelations that decomposition-centric, lightweight models can outperform heavier transformers. Thus, CycleNet unifies decomposition-driven residual learning with explicit periodic modeling, yielding a compact architecture that preserves the performance gains of periodicity-aware methods while achieving strong parameter efficiency.",
