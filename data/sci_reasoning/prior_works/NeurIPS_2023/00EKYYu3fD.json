  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s central contribution is to formalize the choice of latent space through the lens of generator complexity, introducing a latent\u2013data distance whose minimization aligns with minimizing generator complexity, and then parameterizing the optimal data-dependent latent via an encoder. This builds directly on the adversarial learning foundation of GANs, where the training objective can be reinterpreted as minimizing a discrepancy between distributions. WGAN sharpened this perspective by casting GAN training as optimization over an IPM with Lipschitz constraints, making the notion of a distance\u2014and its connection to model capacity\u2014explicit. To operationalize a data-dependent latent, the work follows BiGAN\u2019s insight of coupling a generator with an encoder to match joint distributions, enabling the latent distribution to be learned from data. From the optimal transport side, WAE established an encoder\u2013decoder formulation where a transport cost connects data and latent distributions; the present paper\u2019s distance inherits this transport-minded view and ties it to generator complexity. Empirically and conceptually, the idea that latent choice strongly affects generation quality is anchored by StyleGAN\u2019s W-space reparameterization and by Latent Diffusion\u2019s success in operating within an autoencoder-learned latent space. Finally, GLO demonstrates that learning data-dependent latent codes can make the generator\u2019s task simpler, foreshadowing the paper\u2019s objective of learning an optimal data-dependent latent distribution that best exploits finite generator capacity.",
