  "synthesis_narrative": "This paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014an SSL-specific risk decomposition\u2014sits at the intersection of classical learning theory and modern self-supervised evaluation practice. The theoretical backbone is the approximation\u2013estimation decomposition from statistical learning (Shalev-Shwartz & Ben-David), which the authors generalize to the SSL pipeline. At the same time, the widespread practice of assessing representations with a simple linear probe (Alain & Bengio) directly shapes two of the proposed components: representation usability (how well a simple probe can access information in the representation) and probe generalization (finite-sample error of that probe). The contemporary SSL landscape\u2014dominated by SimCLR, MoCo, BYOL, and SwAV\u2014has converged on ImageNet linear evaluation as a single headline metric. While convenient, this single score obscures trade-offs among representation quality, probe capacity, and data-driven generalization effects. Kornblith et al. highlighted that single-dataset accuracy can be an imperfect proxy for transfer, underscoring the need for richer evaluation. Building on these threads, the paper formulates a four-part decomposition (approximation, representation usability, probe generalization, encoder generalization) and supplies efficient estimators, enabling principled diagnosis of where errors arise. This directly responds to the limitations of linear probing as a monolithic metric and provides a framework that can analyze and compare diverse SSL methods under full- and few-shot regimes, yielding targeted insights into design choices and trade-offs.",
