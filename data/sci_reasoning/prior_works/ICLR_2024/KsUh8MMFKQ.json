  "synthesis_narrative": "SoftGym defined widely used deformable manipulation tasks\u2014especially cloth flattening and folding\u2014but relies on a non-differentiable simulator and a single family of cloth models, constraining gradient-based learning and broader material coverage. PlasticineLab proved the power of differentiable physics for deformable-object control and system identification by leveraging end-to-end gradients in a benchmark, albeit for volumetric soft bodies rather than thin sheets. DiffPD introduced a differentiable projective-dynamics framework where implicit integration and energy-based formulations enable stable gradients through contact-rich dynamics, and it is readily adapted to elastic models beyond simple mass\u2013spring systems. Discrete Shells provided the core thin-shell energy\u2014particularly the discrete bending model\u2014that has become the standard for simulating cloth, paper, and other sheet-like materials with physically grounded behavior. ChainQueen further established the feasibility and benefits of real-time differentiable simulation for manipulation tasks, demonstrating gradient-based control on deformable media. In parallel, SpeedFolding showcased high-performance cloth folding via heuristic/imitation-heavy pipelines, underscoring that many thin-shell manipulation systems remain narrow in scope and not easily extensible across materials or tasks. Together, these works reveal both the promise and the gaps: differentiable simulators enable powerful learning and identification but were not tailored to thin shells, while thin-shell environments lacked differentiability and material diversity. The present work synthesizes differentiable, energy-based simulation (DiffPD) with thin-shell modeling (Discrete Shells), informed by the task settings from SoftGym and the end-to-end learning promise shown by ChainQueen/PlasticineLab, to deliver a unified differentiable platform that scales across thin-shell materials and manipulation tasks.",

However, these approaches face significant challenges when extended to a wider variety of thin-shell materials and a diverse range of tasks.\nOn the other hand, while virtual simulations are shown to be effective in diverse robot skill learning and evaluation, prior thin-shell simulation environments only support a subset of thin-shell materials, which also limits their supported range of tasks. \nTo fill in this gap, we introduce ThinShellLab - a fully differentiable simulation platform tailored for robotic interactions with diverse thin-shell materials possessing varying material properties, enabling flexible thin-shell manipulation skill learning and evaluation.
