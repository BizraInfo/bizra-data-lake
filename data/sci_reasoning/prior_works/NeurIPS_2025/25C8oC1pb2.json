  "synthesis_narrative": "EGGS sits at the intersection of explicit Gaussian primitives, point-based rendering, and frequency-aware neural view synthesis. Its 3D side squarely builds on 3D Gaussian Splatting (Kerbl et al.), inheriting anisotropic 3D Gaussians, alpha compositing, and a GPU-first rasterization pipeline that delivers real-time appearance fidelity. To counter 3DGS\u2019s multi-view inconsistencies, EGGS revives and modernizes the core idea of screen-space Gaussian splats from Surface Splatting, introducing a 2D Gaussian pathway that naturally enforces cross-view consistency and anti-aliased accumulation.\nNeRF provides the multi-view supervision paradigm and the lens through which geometry\u2013appearance trade-offs are framed, while Mip-NeRF\u2019s multiscale anti-aliasing informs EGGS\u2019s Frequency-Decoupled Optimization: separating low- vs. high-frequency signals so 2D Gaussians can stabilize geometry and 3D Gaussians can capture fine appearance. From PlenOctrees, EGGS takes the ethos of explicit, CUDA-optimized rendering for training and inference efficiency, but applies it to a unified rasterizer capable of handling both 2D and 3D splats. Finally, classic point-based systems like QSplat inform EGGS\u2019s adaptive mechanism\u2014analogous to LOD selection\u2014by enabling dynamic exchange between 2D and 3D Gaussian types based on scene content and optimization signals.\nTogether, these works directly shape EGGS\u2019s three core ingredients: a unified hybrid rasterizer, an adaptive type-exchange policy balancing geometry and appearance, and a frequency-decoupled training strategy that exploits the complementary strengths of 2D and 3D Gaussian representations.",
