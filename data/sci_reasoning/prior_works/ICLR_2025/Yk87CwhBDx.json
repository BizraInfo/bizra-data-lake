  "synthesis_narrative": "Procedurally generated worlds with compositional queries, as in CLEVR, established how to precisely probe visual-semantic reasoning using controllable scene generation and functional question programs. The neuro-symbolic concept learner (NS-CL) then showed that executable programs can cleanly separate perception from reasoning by operating over symbolic structures rather than raw pixels. SCAN revealed that sequence models struggle with systematic generalization, especially when compositional rules must be applied to novel combinations\u2014an insight germane to constructing splits that target compositionality. ARC argued that robust intelligence evaluation demands procedurally generated, contamination-resistant tasks that rely on abstract reasoning rather than memorization, emphasizing careful domain design. From the graphics side, CSGNet formalized shapes as constructive solid geometry programs, making explicit that symbolic graphics programs encode exact geometric semantics. DreamCoder further demonstrated that graphics DSLs expose compositional regularities that support programmatic analysis and concept learning, underscoring the value of vector/CSG primitives for interpretable reasoning. Taken together, these works suggest a natural opportunity: use executable graphics programs themselves as the world model to test spatial-semantic reasoning without a vision encoder. By unifying CLEVR-style controlled compositional queries with ARC\u2019s contamination-aware generation, leveraging NS-CL\u2019s decoupling of perception and reasoning, and adopting CSG/DSL representations highlighted by CSGNet and DreamCoder, the present work formulates an evaluation where LLMs must \u201cimagine\u201d renderings from symbolic curve and stroke descriptions and answer semantics-rich questions, enabling targeted tests of compositional and spatial generalization.",

This is nontrivial in part because it is difficult to find tasks which the models have not encountered during training. Utilizing symbolic graphics programs, we propose a domain well-suited to test multiple spatial-semantic reasoning skills of LLMs. Popular in computer graphics, these programs procedurally generate visual data. While LLMs exhibit impressive skills in general program synthesis and analysis, symbolic graphics programs offer a new layer of evaluation: they allow us to test an LLM's ability to answer semantic questions about the images or 3D geometries without a vision encoder. To semantically understand the symbolic programs, LLMs would need to possess the ability to \"imagine\" and reason how the corresponding graphics content would look with only the symbolic description of the local curvatures and strokes. We use this ",
