  "synthesis_narrative": "EPGP\u2019s core innovation\u2014Gaussian process priors whose sample paths are exact solutions of arbitrary linear constant\u2011coefficient PDE systems\u2014rests on importing the Ehrenpreis\u2013Palamodov fundamental principle into GP kernel design. Ehrenpreis and Palamodov provide the foundational representation of all solutions as superpositions of exponential\u2013polynomial modes governed by the operator\u2019s characteristic set. EPGP instantiates this nonlinear Fourier\u2013type transform as a kernel-building recipe, turning a deep PDE representation theorem into a constructive GP prior. This bridges and extends earlier constrained GP efforts: linearly constrained Gaussian processes demonstrated that exact linear constraints can be enforced by parametrizing the null space, but relied on problem\u2011specific constructions; EPGP supplies a general, algorithmic parametrization for entire classes of PDE systems. In parallel, latent force models established the operator\u2013kernel connection via Green\u2019s functions, inspiring EPGP\u2019s operator\u2011centric view while shifting focus to the homogeneous solution space and exact satisfaction. For scalability and modeling flexibility, EPGP\u2019s sparse variant borrows from spectral GP methodology: spectral mixture kernels and sparse spectrum GPs motivate learning discrete spectral components, which EPGP restricts to the PDE\u2019s characteristic variety to maintain exact feasibility while discovering relevant frequencies. Finally, prior GP\u2011for\u2011PDE approaches such as numerical Gaussian processes highlighted a practical gap\u2014PDEs enforced via likelihood or time stepping do not guarantee exact solutions\u2014directly motivating EPGP\u2019s prior\u2011level enforcement. Together, these works form the direct intellectual lineage of EPGP\u2019s theory and algorithms.",
