  "synthesis_narrative": "PointNet established that unordered sets can be processed directly with per-point MLPs and symmetric pooling, yielding global descriptors without resorting to grids. PointNet++ extended this by progressively grouping neighborhoods to model local structures, but its multi-stage hierarchy adds repeated sampling, neighborhood searches, and latency. DGCNN introduced EdgeConv, dynamically building k-NN graphs to encode local geometric relations while preserving permutation invariance, showing that local neighborhoods can be captured effectively alongside global aggregation. PointMLP later showed that a streamlined, single-stage per-point MLP augmented with lightweight geometric priors can recover both local discrimination and global semantics without complex hierarchical stacks. In the event-vision community, EST demonstrated voxelized temporal binning to make events CNN-friendly, while HATS built histogram-based time-surface representations; both convert sparse asynchronous events into dense grids, sacrificing sparsity and inducing extra data mapping before learning.\n\nTogether, these works suggested that event streams should be treated as point clouds to preserve sparsity, and that effective local-global feature extraction need not rely on heavy multi-stage hierarchies. SpikePoint synthesizes PointNet\u2019s permutation-invariant point processing, DGCNN\u2019s local neighborhood reasoning, and PointMLP\u2019s single-stage efficiency, while directly addressing the EST/HATS rasterization gap by keeping the raw event cloud representation. The natural next step was to implement these point operators with spiking neurons and surrogate training, enabling an end-to-end, ultra-efficient, single-stage SNN that extracts local and global features on event clouds without dense conversions.",

    "abstract": "Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that respond to local changes in light intensity and feature low latency, high energy efficiency, and high dynamic range. Meanwhile, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant attention due to their remarkable efficiency and fault tolerance. By synergistically harnessing the energy efficiency inherent in event cameras and the spike-based processing capabilities of SNNs, their integration could enable ultra-low-power application scenarios, such as action recognition tasks. However, existing approaches often entail converting asynchronous events into conventional frames, leading to additional data mapping efforts and a loss of sparsity, contradicting the design concept of SNNs and event cameras. To address this challenge, we propose SpikePoint, a novel end-to-end point-based SNN architecture. SpikePoint excels at processing sparse event cloud data, effectively extracting both global and local features through a singular-stage structure. ",
