  "synthesis_narrative": "EvoBrain\u2019s core contribution\u2014explicitly modeling time-evolving EEG connectivity and formalizing a time-then-graph dynamic GNN\u2014sits at the intersection of dynamic graph learning, spatiotemporal GNN design, and neuroscience evidence about seizure dynamics. Dynamic GNN advances like EvolveGCN and Temporal Graph Networks established that both node states and graph structure can change and that temporal memory is vital, but they generally presuppose given dynamic graphs or evolve model parameters rather than learning edges from raw multivariate signals. In parallel, spatiotemporal architectures for sensors, notably Graph WaveNet and MTGNN, demonstrated that strong performance emerges when temporal modules process signals before graph reasoning and when adjacency can be learned adaptively from data; however, these graphs are typically static or slowly varying and were not tailored to abrupt regime shifts like seizures. Neural Relational Inference bridged this gap by showing how latent, time-varying relations can be inferred from trajectories, directly motivating EvoBrain\u2019s dynamic edge estimation from EEG. Finally, ST-GCN clarified design choices for composing temporal and spatial operators, a theme EvoBrain extends with a theoretical analysis that favors a time-then-graph pipeline under rapidly changing dependencies. Grounding all of this, Khambhati et al. provide neuroscientific evidence that seizure networks evolve across onset, propagation, and termination, justifying explicit dynamic connectivity. Together, these works directly inform EvoBrain\u2019s dynamic graph construction, temporal-first processing, and theory-backed architecture for seizure detection.",
