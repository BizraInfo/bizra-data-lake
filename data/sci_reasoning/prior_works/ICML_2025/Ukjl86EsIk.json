  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014linking prediction sets to optimal decision-making for risk-averse agents via Value-at-Risk (VaR) and deriving Risk-Averse Calibration (RAC)\u2014rests on three intertwined lines of prior work. First, conformal prediction provides the distribution-free machinery for constructing valid prediction sets. Vovk, Gammerman, and Shafer introduced conformal prediction, giving the finite-sample guarantees that RAC leverages, while Romano, Patterson, and Cand\u00e8s\u2019s conformalized quantile regression points directly at quantile-oriented objectives like VaR that the present work formalizes. Second, recent advances in risk-aware conformal methods laid the blueprint for targeting decision-relevant risks: Bates, Angelopoulos, Lei, and Romano\u2019s Conformal Risk Control generalizes conformal calibration to user-defined risks, paving the way for the paper\u2019s specialization to VaR and its exact population characterization of optimal sets.\nThird, decision-theoretic and optimization foundations clarify why prediction sets and max\u2013min policies are the right coupling for risk aversion. Artzner et al. formalize risk measures and position VaR within coherent risk theory, while Rockafellar and Uryasev\u2019s tail-risk optimization connects quantiles to tractable optimization, reinforcing the paper\u2019s VaR-optimality results. Finally, Ben-Tal and Nemirovski\u2019s robust optimization shows that acting by minimizing worst-case loss over an uncertainty set is optimal under ambiguity, directly supporting the paper\u2019s max\u2013min policy result when actions are conditioned on prediction sets. Complementing these, Sadinle, Lei, and Wasserman\u2019s decision-theoretic treatment of optimal set-valued predictors informs the structural optimality of prediction sets for downstream actions. Together, these works directly enable the paper\u2019s decision-theoretic foundation and distribution-free RAC algorithm.",
