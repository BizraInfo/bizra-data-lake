  "synthesis_narrative": "Neural Ordinary Differential Equations established how learned vector fields can define continuous-time trajectories with well-posedness guarantees, a perspective later adopted for graphs by Continuous Graph Neural Networks, which parameterized time derivatives via message passing on nodes and edges. Second Order Neural ODEs showed that modeling accelerations with explicit position\u2013velocity states captures second-order dynamics more faithfully than first-order flows. In parallel, E(n) Equivariant Graph Neural Networks introduced a lightweight, distance-based message passing rule that preserves rotation and translation equivariance for 3D particle systems. Graph-based physical simulators such as Learning to Simulate Complex Physics with Graph Networks demonstrated strong performance on multi-body dynamics but relied on stacked discrete updates and predominantly first-order transitions between states. Lagrangian Neural Networks highlighted that encoding second-order motion laws as an inductive bias leads to physically consistent trajectories under symmetries. SE(3)-Transformers further underscored the importance of exact geometric equivariance for 3D reasoning, albeit through discrete, higher-order representations. Together, these works revealed both the promise and the gap: continuous-time modeling provides trajectory uniqueness and stability, equivariant GNNs provide symmetry-respecting interactions, and second-order formalisms encode true physical laws\u2014yet prior models either lacked continuity, second-order structure, or both. The natural next step is to synthesize these strands by defining an E(n)-equivariant graph field in a second-order ODE over positions and velocities, marrying Neural ODE continuity with EGNN-style symmetry and Lagrangian-inspired inductive biases to learn unique trajectories between adjacent states.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with equivariant properties have emerged as powerful tools for modeling complex dynamics of multi-object physical systems. However, their generalization ability is limited by the inadequate consideration of physical inductive biases: (1) Existing studies overlook the continuity of transitions among system states, opting to employ several discrete transformation layers to learn the direct mapping between two adjacent states; (2) Most models only account for first-order velocity information, despite the fact that many physical systems are governed by second-order motion laws. To incorporate these inductive biases, we propose the Second-order Equivariant Graph Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (SEGNO). Specifically, we show how the second-order continuity can be incorporated into GNNs while maintaining the equivariant property. Furthermore, we offer theoretical insights into SEGNO, highlighting that it can learn a unique trajectory between adjacent states,",
