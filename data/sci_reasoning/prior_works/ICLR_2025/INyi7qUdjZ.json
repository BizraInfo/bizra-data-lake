  "synthesis_narrative": "Work interpreting in-context learning (ICL) as implicit Bayesian inference argued that when pretraining tasks are diverse, models infer latent task structure from context rather than memorize idiosyncrasies, framing ICL as a competition resolved by the data distribution. Empirical studies then showed that increasing task diversity provokes a sharp transition from memorization to generalization in small transformers on synthetic tasks, highlighting a diversity threshold but leaving its mechanism and predictability open. Mechanistic analyses revealed specific circuits\u2014most notably induction heads\u2014that emerge abruptly and function relatively independently, indicating modular sub-systems that could vie to control behavior. Parallel lines established that transformers can implement gradient-descent-like algorithms in context and mapped algorithmic circuit templates on synthetic functions, furnishing a controlled setting and machinery to dissect internal mechanisms. Grokking studies further separated memorizing from algorithmic circuits and documented their distinct learning speeds, hinting that kinetics, not just capacity, governs which circuit prevails during training. Finally, measurements of how memorization scales with model/data introduced the idea of memorization scaling laws. Taken together, these strands suggested a natural opportunity: treat memorization and generalization as largely independent sub-circuits whose learning rates depend on task diversity, and ask when the faster learner dominates. By combining the diversity-dependent ICL paradigm with circuit modularity, kinetic progress measures, and memorization scaling, the present work formulates and validates a theory where differential learning kinetics\u2014not capacity\u2014govern the sharp transition, yielding a quantitative scaling law that predicts the diversity threshold for generalization.",

    "abstract": "Transformers exhibit in-context learning (ICL): the ability to use novel information presented in the context without additional weight updates. Recent work shows that ICL emerges when models are trained on a sufficiently diverse set of tasks and the transition from memorization to generalization is sharp with increasing task diversity. One interpretation is that a network's limited capacity to memorize favors generalization. Here, we examine the mechanistic underpinnings of this transition using a small transformer applied to a synthetic ICL task. Using theory and experiment, we show that the sub-circuits that memorize and generalize can be viewed as largely independent. The relative *rates* at which these sub-circuits learn explains the transition from memorization to generalization, rather than capacity constraints. We uncover a memorization scaling law, which determines the task diversity threshold at which the network generalizes. The theory quantitatively explains a variety of ot",
