  "synthesis_narrative": "Place3D\u2019s core innovation\u2014using a semantic occupancy\u2013based surrogate metric (M\u2011SOG) to optimize multi\u2011LiDAR placement and validate it through data generation and downstream tasks\u2014stands on three converging lines of prior work. First, SSCNet and SemanticKITTI established semantic occupancy grids as a principled 3D representation and provided well-accepted evaluation protocols (occupancy/semantic IoU). This made occupancy a task-agnostic yet perception-relevant target, enabling Place3D to define M\u2011SOG as a quantitative proxy for sensor layout quality independent of any specific detector or segmenter. The Occ3D benchmark further modernized and standardized occupancy evaluation in autonomous driving, empirically reinforcing the link between occupancy quality and downstream performance; this underpinned Place3D\u2019s choice to optimize placements via an occupancy-centric surrogate rather than directly over every downstream model.\nSecond, realistic LiDAR simulation became viable with LiDARsim and, at a broader level, CARLA, which provide controllable environments, weather, and arbitrary sensor poses. These tools showed that one can systematically explore sensor configurations and conditions in silico, a capability Place3D leverages to search placement space efficiently and to generate multi-condition data for evaluation.\nThird, real-world multi\u2011LiDAR datasets like A2D2 and the Ford Multi\u2011AV Seasonal Dataset demonstrated heterogeneous LiDAR rigs and the necessity to remain robust across seasons and environments. These datasets motivated Place3D\u2019s emphasis on optimizing multi\u2011LiDAR configurations and validating them under adverse conditions, closing the loop from principled surrogate metric to practical placement design.",
