  "synthesis_narrative": "Instruction-tuned RLHF systems were crystallized by work showing that supervised fine-tuning, reward modeling, and PPO can steer large language models toward human-preferred behavior. Direct Preference Optimization reframed alignment as a supervised objective on pairwise preferences, avoiding explicit reward models while preserving the core preference-optimization setup. In parallel, robustness research developed worst-group optimization, demonstrating that ERM overfits majority patterns and that Group DRO\u2019s min\u2013max objective elevates performance on hard or minority groups. Invariant Risk Minimization formalized the aim of predictors whose conditional relationships remain stable across environments, while Environment Inference for Invariant Learning showed that, when group labels are absent, one can adversarially partition data to expose invariance violations. Fairness Without Demographics established that worst-case performance can be improved without group annotations via distributionally robust optimization, laying groundwork for group-agnostic robustness. Empirically, RLHF work on summarization revealed that directly optimizing learned rewards invites shortcut exploitation and degraded generalization.\nTogether, these strands reveal a gap: preference-optimized RLHF methods optimize average reward and can exploit spurious shortcuts, yet group labels needed for robust training are unavailable. The natural next step is to infer groups that accentuate performance disparities, then couple preference/RL objectives with a worst-group or invariance-guided criterion. This paper synthesizes DPO/RLHF training with EIIL-style group discovery and Group DRO/IRM principles, yielding a policy that focuses learning on challenging groups to generalize alignment consistently across domains.",
