  "synthesis_narrative": "This paper fuses two lines of theory: when interpolation is benign and why optimization without explicit regularization still yields classifiers with good generalization. On the benign overfitting side, Bartlett\u2013Long\u2013Lugosi\u2013Tsigler\u2019s signal-plus-noise framework formalized how interpolation can generalize in regression, while Muthukumar\u2013Vodrahalli\u2013Sahai\u2013Oymak quantified the role of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in producing benign versus harmful regimes. The present work translates this SNR-driven phase-transition picture to binary classification with two-layer leaky ReLU networks and hinge loss, deriving explicit SNR thresholds for benign and non-benign overfitting under a signal/noise subspace model.\n\nThe optimization mechanism comes from implicit bias results: Soudry et al. showed that gradient descent on separable data implicitly seeks max-margin solutions, and Lyu\u2013Li extended margin maximization to positively homogeneous neural networks, a class that includes leaky ReLUs. Complementary analyses of the exact dynamics of (stochastic) gradient methods on separable data by Nacson\u2013Srebro\u2013Soudry, together with classical SVM theory via Pegasos for hinge loss, ground the paper\u2019s key claim that gradient descent on hinge-trained leaky ReLU networks approximately maximizes margin. This margin viewpoint explains both benign and harmful overfitting outcomes as functions of SNR.\n\nBy leveraging margin maximization to connect optimization to generalization, and importing SNR-based benign-overfitting insights to a non-linear, moderate-dimensional setting, the paper advances beyond earlier analyses that implicitly rely on high-dimensional near-orthogonality. It thus identifies precise conditions under which interpolating leaky ReLU classifiers trained with hinge loss generalize or fail, unifying benign and harmful regimes under a single margin\u2013SNR framework.",
