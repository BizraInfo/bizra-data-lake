  "synthesis_narrative": "GCQ fuses discrete representation learning with neurobiologically grounded dynamics to produce a compact, action-conditioned world model. The discrete backbone comes from VQ-VAE, which established how learnable codebooks enable efficient compression; GCQ extends this idea to sequences by making the codebook dynamic and action-conditioned. The dynamical mechanism is inherited from continuous attractor models of grid cells, particularly Burak and Fiete\u2019s path-integration framework, where velocities (actions) shift neural activity on a low-dimensional manifold to yield grid-like tilings. Hafting et al.\u2019s discovery of grid cells provides the biological target whose periodic structure GCQ encodes as quantized codewords. On the functional side, Stachenfeld et al.\u2019s predictive-map theory situates grid-like codes as substrates for long-horizon prediction and planning, goals GCQ explicitly serves with its spatiotemporally consistent discrete latent space. Banino et al. showed that grid-like codes can emerge in trained agents to support vector-based navigation, motivating GCQ\u2019s explicit use of such codes for goal-directed control. The world-model lineage of Ha and Schmidhuber demonstrates the power of compressing observation\u2013action histories for imagination and planning; GCQ follows this paradigm but with discrete, grid-structured latents. Finally, the Tolman\u2013Eichenbaum Machine frames grid codes as a generalizable representational scaffold, a view GCQ operationalizes via attractor-derived, action-updated quantization that unifies spatial and temporal compression for prediction, planning, and inverse modeling.",
