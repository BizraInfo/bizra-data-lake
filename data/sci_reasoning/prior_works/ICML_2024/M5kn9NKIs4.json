  "synthesis_narrative": "SemiRES sits at the intersection of referring expression segmentation (RES) and semi-supervised learning. The task itself is rooted in the formulation of segmenting a natural-language\u2013specified region (Hu et al., 2016), which defines the supervision target SemiRES seeks even when labels are scarce. The training strategy follows the teacher\u2013student pseudo-labeling paradigm established by Mean Teacher, yet SemiRES recognizes a central limitation of such approaches\u2014noisy and confirmation-biased pseudo-labels\u2014highlighted by CPS (Chen et al., 2021) and U2PL (Wang et al., 2022), with boundary pixels being particularly error-prone. The breakthrough enabling SemiRES\u2019s key contribution is SAM (Kirillov et al., 2023): its promptable, high-fidelity masks provide the boundary precision that raw pseudo-labels lack. SemiRES operationalizes this through two concrete mechanisms: IoU-based Optimal Matching (IOM) to select the most compatible SAM mask and Composite Parts Integration (CPI) to assemble multiple SAM parts when a single mask does not capture the referred object. In instances where SAM candidates remain imperfect, SemiRES\u2019s Pixel-Wise Adjustment (PWA) still guides the student while mitigating noise. Finally, insights from Grounded-SAM (Liu et al., 2023) show how SAM can be harnessed in language-conditioned contexts, reinforcing SemiRES\u2019s strategy of aligning SAM proposals with textual intent. Together, these works directly shape SemiRES\u2019s innovation: SAM-guided pseudo-label refinement tailored to RES.",
