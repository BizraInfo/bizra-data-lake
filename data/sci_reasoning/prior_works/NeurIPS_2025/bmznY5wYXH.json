  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014an analytic parametrization of feasible policies that steer Gaussian mixture models under linear dynamics, reducing the problem to a small linear program over mixture couplings\u2014rests on two complementary strands of prior work. The first is the Schr\u00f6dinger bridge (SB) lineage from Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s original formulation to L\u00e9onard\u2019s synthesis with entropic optimal transport (OT). This theory legitimizes casting distribution steering as an entropic control problem and clarifies why coupling across mixture components can be organized via an OT-like program.\nThe second strand provides the computational primitives for the proposed decomposition. Chen\u2013Georgiou\u2013Pavon develop explicit SB solutions for linear (including time-varying) dynamics between Gaussian marginals, supplying closed-form optimal controls and costs. These Gaussian bridges become the ground costs in the present paper. Delon\u2013Desolneux show that distances between GMMs can be computed by solving a discrete OT problem over component weights with Gaussian-to-Gaussian ground costs; the current work adopts this structural idea but substitutes ground costs derived from Gaussian SBs, yielding a linear program whose size grows linearly with mixture components.\nAgainst the prevailing computational approaches\u2014Sinkhorn/IPF-style solvers and data-driven score-based SB methods (Benamou et al.; De Bortoli et al.)\u2014the paper offers an analytic alternative that avoids heavy training and scales favorably. Together, these prior works directly inform the paper\u2019s decomposition (mixture-level LP) and its inner analytic blocks (Gaussian SB under linear dynamics), enabling efficient extensions to controllable linear time-varying systems and multi-marginal settings.",
