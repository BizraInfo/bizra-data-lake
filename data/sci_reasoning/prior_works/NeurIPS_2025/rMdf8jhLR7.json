  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014a hybrid, non-Euclidean generalization of gradient clipping that unifies steepest descent with conditional gradients\u2014draws on three converging lines of work. First, Pascanu et al. introduced gradient norm clipping to stabilize deep learning, which this paper elevates from a heuristic to a principled mechanism by analyzing descent under norms tuned to the problem geometry. The theoretical backbone comes from non-Euclidean smoothness: Nesterov\u2019s treatment of steepest descent in general norms and the relative smoothness framework of Lu\u2013Freund\u2013Nesterov provide the language and tools to state and prove descent guarantees under (L0, L1)-smoothness, moving beyond Euclidean Lipschitz-gradient assumptions.\nSecond, the conditional gradient (Frank\u2013Wolfe) lineage\u2014codified in Jaggi\u2019s affine-invariant analysis and standard short-step schedule\u2014supplies the projection-free counterpart that the method integrates with steepest descent. This same perspective enables a clean reinterpretation of weight decay: echoing the decoupling principle of Loshchilov & Hutter, the paper shows that a Frank\u2013Wolfe short step toward the origin implements weight decay in a principled, geometry-aware way.\nThird, to handle stochasticity, the work builds on stochastic Frank\u2013Wolfe developments (Reddi et al.) and adopts momentum-based recursive gradient estimators in the spirit of STORM (Cutkosky & Orabona). This combination yields an order-optimal O(n^{-1/4}) rate under the generalized smoothness setting. Together, these strands directly shape the algorithmic design, analysis, and practical instantiation (Clipped Scion) presented in the paper.",
