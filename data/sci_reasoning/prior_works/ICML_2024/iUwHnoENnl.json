  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014framing model alignment as prospect-theoretic optimization\u2014rests on importing behavioral-economics structure into preference learning while reinterpreting mainstream RLHF objectives. Tversky and Kahneman\u2019s cumulative prospect theory provides the key ingredients: a loss-averse, asymmetric value function and probability weighting that formalize how humans perceive gains, losses, and uncertainty. Prelec\u2019s parametric weighting offers a practical instantiation of these perceptual distortions, enabling a tractable human-aware loss. Against this behavioral foundation, the authors revisit the dominant alignment pipeline established by Christiano et al., Ziegler et al., and Ouyang et al., where pairwise human preferences are modeled via Bradley\u2013Terry likelihoods and optimized either through RL or direct surrogates. Bradley and Terry\u2019s 1952 model underlies both reward modeling and the statistical form optimized by many preference objectives. DPO crystallized a strong non-RL alternative by directly optimizing a preference-induced objective, but it still centers on maximizing the log-likelihood of preferences rather than human utility per se. The present work identifies a broader family of human-aware losses (HALOs) that subsumes such objectives, then replaces the BT likelihood with a prospect-theoretic utility that captures loss aversion and probability weighting. This shift yields KTO, which aligns models by directly maximizing human utility and, empirically, matches or surpasses preference-based methods across scales while learning from a binary accept/reject signal\u2014showing that the behavioral structure, not just richer labels, is pivotal.",
