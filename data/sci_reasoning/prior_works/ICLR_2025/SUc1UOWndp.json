  "synthesis_narrative": "Singular learning theory established the learning coefficient as a precise measure of model complexity in non-regular (singular) settings, showing how geometry near a solution governs generalization behavior. Building on that, WBIC gave a practical recipe to estimate learning coefficients around local minima from data, offering tools to study complexity in concrete models. In parallel, transformer interpretability matured: a formal framework for transformer circuits conceptualized heads as modular computational units in small attention-only models, making head-level analysis natural. Induction-heads research demonstrated that specific head functions emerge in two-layer attention-only transformers during training, suggesting measurable developmental phases. Empirical analyses of multi-head attention documented both specialization and redundancy across heads, while toy models of superposition showed how features can overlap and compete within limited capacity. Finally, progress measures for grokking emphasized the value of tracking stagewise development, albeit with heuristic rather than theory-grounded metrics. Together these strands pointed to a gap: a rigorous, component-wise, training-time complexity measure that can reveal when heads differentiate, specialize, or remain polysemantic. By marrying SLT\u2019s learning coefficient with the circuits view of transformers, the refined local learning coefficient provides per-head, time-resolved complexity estimates that diagnose developmental phases, quantify specialization, and surface circuits such as multigram mechanisms\u2014offering a principled toolkit for developmental interpretability.",

    "abstract": "We introduce refined variants of the Local Learning Coefficient (LLC), a measure of model complexity grounded in singular learning theory, to study the development of internal structure in transformer language models during training. By applying these refined LLCs (rLLCs) to individual components of a two-layer attention-only transformer, we gain novel insights into the progressive differentiation and specialization of attention heads. Our methodology reveals how attention heads differentiate into distinct functional roles over the course of training, analyzes the types of data these heads specialize to process, and discovers a previously unidentified multigram circuit. These findings demonstrate that rLLCs provide a principled, quantitative toolkit for developmental interpretability, which aims to understand models through their evolution across the learning process. This work advances the field of developmental interpretability by providing a mathematically rigorous approach to under",
