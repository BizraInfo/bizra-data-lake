  "synthesis_narrative": "TimeBase\u2019s core innovation\u2014ultra-lightweight long-term forecasting via (1) compact temporal basis extraction and (2) segment-level prediction\u2014emerges at the intersection of three intellectual threads. First, the low-rank premise for multivariate time series established by TRMF directly motivates learning a small set of shared temporal bases, rather than modeling every point independently. N-BEATS operationalized this premise for forecasting by showing that learned basis expansions can capture trend and seasonality; TimeBase adapts this idea to the LTSF regime, extracting minimal bases that generalize across long horizons.\nSecond, modern LTSF works defined the task setting and highlighted both the promise and the cost of deep architectures. Informer and Autoformer established long-horizon benchmarks and the utility of decomposition, but their attention-heavy designs exposed inefficiency that TimeBase explicitly targets by replacing attention with compact bases. Zeng et al. (DLinear) then revealed that minimalist designs can outperform complex models in LTSF, yet pure linearity underfits complex patterns\u2014precisely the gap TimeBase fills by combining minimalism with expressive basis components.\nThird, segment-level modeling matured in PatchTST and N-HiTS: patch tokenization and blockwise interpolation demonstrated the value of operating on segments. TimeBase extends this line by making segments the forecasting target itself, yielding stable, efficient predictions while optimally utilizing parameters through shared bases.",
