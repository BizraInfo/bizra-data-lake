  "synthesis_narrative": "SDF-Sim\u2019s core contribution\u2014scalable learned rigid-body simulation over implicit shapes\u2014arises by fusing two mature lines of work: graph-based learned physics and SDF-based shape representations. Interaction Networks introduced the relational, message-passing view of physical systems, which Learning to Simulate Complex Physics with Graph Networks (GNS) scaled into a practical, general-purpose learned simulator. MeshGraphNets then showed how to incorporate geometry via meshes, but also exposed the computational bottleneck of mesh resolution and expensive distance computations when scaling to many objects and complex shapes.\n\nTo remove that bottleneck, SDF-Sim turns to implicit neural geometry. DeepSDF provided a compact, continuous SDF representation with efficient distance and normal queries\u2014exactly the primitives needed for collision detection and contact response. SAL further enabled training SDFs directly from partial or noisy observations, aligning with SDF-Sim\u2019s ambition to operate \u201cfor vision,\u201d i.e., to learn simulators that can consume shapes derived from real-world sensing. The practical viability of SDFs for fast geometric queries was established at scale by KinectFusion\u2019s TSDF pipeline, which demonstrated the speed and robustness of distance-field representations for real-time applications.\n\nFinally, analytic engines like MuJoCo crystallized the modeling targets and pain points in rigid contact simulation\u2014accuracy, stability, and computation\u2014against which learned alternatives are measured. SDF-Sim synthesizes these threads: it retains GNN-based relational dynamics, swaps meshes for learned SDFs to achieve scalable distance/contact computation, and thereby delivers a learned rigid-body simulator designed for large, object-dense scenes and vision-driven settings.",
