  "synthesis_narrative": "Contrastive Predictive Coding introduced a temporal InfoNCE objective that aligns nearby time steps while separating negatives, crystallizing the modern temporal contrastive formulation used to learn video representations. CURL adapted this CPC-style loss to pixel-based reinforcement learning, demonstrating that contrastive video pretraining can yield strong policy learning and establishing a canonical objective-architecture regime. In parallel, World Models coupled autoencoding with latent forward prediction to learn compact dynamics from video, while Dreamer strengthened this paradigm by training latent dynamics models with reconstruction to plan and control from pixels. R3M scaled temporal contrastive pretraining to large internet video corpora for manipulation, showcasing robust downstream control gains and highlighting the promise of video-only pretraining. On the theory side, Saunshi et al. provided generalization guarantees for contrastive learning under multi-view assumptions, offering tools to reason about risk bounds for contrastive objectives. Complementarily, Pathak et al. revealed the \u201cnoisy-TV\u201d pitfall: predictive objectives can be hijacked by exogenous stochasticity unrelated to control, foreshadowing failures in realistic videos with temporally correlated distractors. Together, these works posed an open question: under what precise conditions do autoencoding, temporal contrastive, and forward modeling from videos recover the latent MDP state relevant for control? The current paper synthesizes CPC-style temporal contrastive objectives, forward modeling practices from World Models/Dreamer, and contrastive learning theory to derive upper bounds under i.i.d. noise and to formalize exogenous temporally correlated noise that induces failure. This yields principled conditions and limitations for video pretraining, theoretically grounding recent empirical successes while explaining their brittleness to distractors.",

Even though significant empirical advances have been made on this problem, a theoretical understanding remains absent. We initiate the theoretical investigation into principled approaches for representation learning and focus on learning the latent state representations of the underlying MDP using video data. We study two types of settings: one where there is iid noise in the observation, and a more challenging setting where there is also the presence of exogenous noise, which is non-iid noise that is temporally correlated, such as the motion of people or cars in the background. We study three commonly used approaches: autoencoding, temporal contrastive learning, and forward modeling. We prove upper bounds for temporal contrastive learning and forward modeling in the presence of only iid noise. We show that these approaches can le",
