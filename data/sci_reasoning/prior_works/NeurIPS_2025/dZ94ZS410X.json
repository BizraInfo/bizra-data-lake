  "synthesis_narrative": "RF-Agent\u2019s core innovation\u2014casting reward function design as a sequential decision-making problem and solving it with an LLM-driven, Monte Carlo Tree Search\u2014sits at the intersection of two lines of work. First, Eureka demonstrated that LLMs can author dense reward functions for low-level control tasks by iteratively refining code based on training outcomes, but its greedy/evolutionary search struggled to exploit accumulated feedback and scale to complex tasks. Second, the language-agent literature (ReAct) and structured reasoning methods (Tree of Thoughts) showed that LLMs can reason over multi-step plans, interact with tools, and explore alternate solution paths. Building on these, LATS established that MCTS provides a powerful backbone for language agents, combining exploration-exploitation with systematic reuse of past rollouts.\nRF-Agent unifies these insights: it treats reward design edits as actions, simulator results and diagnostics as observations, and applies UCT-style selection to guide exploration using historical evaluations. Inspired by AlphaGo\u2019s integration of learned guidance with MCTS, RF-Agent uses the LLM\u2019s contextual reasoning to propose and prioritize edits while the tree reuses outcome statistics, overcoming the myopic updates of greedy/evolutionary loops. Reflexion\u2019s emphasis on learning from prior mistakes further informs RF-Agent\u2019s explicit use of past feedback within the tree. The result is a principled, search-based language-agent framework that more efficiently discovers effective reward functions for challenging control tasks by leveraging both multi-stage reasoning and historical information.",
