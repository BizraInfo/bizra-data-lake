  "synthesis_narrative": "Score-based diffusion establishes that the score function is the gradient of a learned log-density, giving a principled energy interpretation and enabling gradient-based shaping of sampling trajectories. Building on this, composable diffusion demonstrates that multiple conditional generative factors can be composed by summing their scores (a product-of-experts view), yielding images that simultaneously satisfy several constraints. Classifier-free guidance refines this by showing how unconditional and conditional scores can be combined and scaled to trade off fidelity versus constraint satisfaction. In sequential decision-making, Diffuser leverages diffusion as an energy-shaped trajectory prior, guiding sampling with reward signals rather than directly optimizing a brittle learned dynamics model. For inverse problems, Diffusion Posterior Sampling formalizes combining a learned diffusion prior with measurement-consistency terms via score addition, unifying priors and constraints within one sampling procedure. In parallel, Fourier Neural Operators and graph-network simulators provide fast learned surrogates for PDEs and physical dynamics but exhibit vulnerability when used as optimization objectives, where gradient-based search often exploits model imperfections to produce adversarial designs. Together, these works suggest replacing direct optimization over learned forward models with optimization in the space of diffusion energies, and composing multiple design requirements by summing scores. The present paper synthesizes these insights by training diffusion models for design subcomponents and optimizing their combined energy landscape, achieving compositional inverse design that resists adversarial failure modes typical of surrogate-based optimization while naturally accommodating multi-constraint PDE-governed systems.",

    "abstract": "Inverse design, where we seek to design input variables in order to optimize an underlying objective function, is an important problem that arises across fields such as mechanical engineering to aerospace engineering. Inverse design is typically formulated as an optimization problem, with recent works leveraging optimization across learned dynamics models. However, as models are optimized they tend to fall into adversarial modes, preventing effective sampling. We illustrate that by instead optimizing over the learned energy function captured by the diffusion model, we can avoid such adversarial examples and significantly improve design performance. We further illustrate how such a design system is compositional, enabling us to combine multiple different diffusion models representing subcomponents of our desired system to design systems with every specified component. In an N-body interaction task and a challenging 2D multi-airfoil design task, we demonstrate that by composing the learn",
