  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of this paper\u2014a mechanistic account that a sparse set of specialized attention heads performs long-context factual retrieval\u2014emerges from two converging lineages. First, mechanistic interpretability established that individual heads can implement algorithmic behaviors: Elhage et al.\u2019s induction heads showed single-head copy/retrieval mechanisms, and Wang et al. mapped a concrete head-level circuit (including \u2018name mover\u2019 heads) that retrieves and routes information within prompts. These works made it plausible and methodologically feasible to hunt for task-critical heads and to verify their roles. Complementing this, classic analyses of multi-head attention by Michel et al. and Voita et al. demonstrated that only a small subset of heads do the heavy lifting and that per-head ablation isolates function\u2014directly underpinning the paper\u2019s findings of universal yet sparse \u2018retrieval heads.\u2019\nSecond, long-context evaluation literature defined the problem and exposed the gap this work explains. Kamradt\u2019s Needle-in-a-Haystack provided a clean recall probe across arbitrary positions, while Liu et al. revealed systematic failures (\u2018lost in the middle\u2019), motivating a mechanistic account of when and how retrieval succeeds. Finally, the validation ethos of causal scrubbing (Chan et al.) shaped the paper\u2019s causal interventions\u2014ablations and patching\u2014to confirm that the identified heads mediate retrieval. Together, these strands enable the paper to show that retrieval heads are intrinsic (pre-existing in short-context pretraining), sparse, universal across models, and dynamically activated to attend to answer-bearing spans, thereby mechanistically explaining long-context factuality.",
