  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014identifying heavy-tailed class imbalance as the key reason Adam outperforms gradient descent (GD) on language models\u2014stands at the intersection of three lines of prior work. First, Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015) and related adaptive methods established element-wise preconditioning and scale-normalization, which can mitigate disparities across coordinates. AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011) sharpened this perspective by showing adaptivity advantages when features are rare or sparse\u2014a precursor to the present paper\u2019s argument that rare tokens (classes) in language produce systematically smaller or slower updates for GD but are naturally compensated by adaptive normalization. Second, the field\u2019s empirical puzzle was posed by Wilson et al. (2017), who observed that adaptive methods often underperform SGD in vision yet excel in NLP; the present work explains this modality gap by tying it to the Zipfian heavy-tailed token frequencies (Zipf, 1949) that make infrequent classes dominate the average loss while receiving insufficient progress under GD. Third, theory on optimization dynamics under cross-entropy (Soudry et al., 2018) supplies tools to analyze continuous-time GD and its slow rates, which this paper leverages to show particularly slow convergence on low-frequency classes. Complementing this, long-tail learning work (Cui et al., 2019) formalized how imbalance distorts training objectives, motivating the present optimizer-centric lens. Finally, the robustness of sign-based methods (Bernstein et al., 2018) anticipates the paper\u2019s finding that sign/Adam-like updates are less sensitive to frequency-induced gradient scaling, completing a coherent explanation across empirical, statistical, and dynamical viewpoints.",
