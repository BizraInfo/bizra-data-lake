  "synthesis_narrative": "SceneDesigner\u2019s core idea\u2014controllable multi-object image generation with explicit 9-DoF pose manipulation\u2014sits at the intersection of dense geometric correspondences and modular diffusion conditioning. The CNOCS representation is a direct conceptual extension of NOCS, moving from category-level 6D pose/size to a camera-view\u2013encoded, per-pixel map that captures translation, rotation, and scale for multiple objects. This design is further inspired by DensePose\u2019s principle of mapping image pixels to a canonical space, ensuring that the conditioning signal has clear geometric semantics and stable gradients.\nOn the generative side, SceneDesigner relies on latent diffusion as the high-fidelity synthesis backbone, maintaining the base model frozen and injecting control via an auxiliary branch. This branched conditioning mechanism follows ControlNet\u2019s architectural template, enabling efficient training and robust control from external dense maps\u2014here, the CNOCS channels encoding 9-DoF. While earlier layout-to-image work (Layout2Im) demonstrated that bounding boxes and category tags can guide multi-object composition, SceneDesigner advances this thread by conditioning on richer, geometry-aware maps that govern not just locations and sizes but also orientations.\nFinally, established pose datasets and benchmarks such as PASCAL3D+ and YCB-Video shaped both the problem formulation (pose parameterization across categories) and the data practices underlying the new ObjectPose9D dataset. Together, these works directly enable SceneDesigner\u2019s stable training, accurate pose control, and high-quality multi-object synthesis.",
