  "synthesis_narrative": "Acoustic Volume Rendering (AVR) adapts the integral machinery of neural volumetric rendering to the acoustic domain of impulse responses. The key conceptual backbone comes from NeRF and classic volume rendering: the transmittance-weighted line integral (Max, NeRF) and directional integration (Kajiya) provide the calculus that AVR recasts into the frequency domain with complex-valued attenuation and phase accumulation, matching the physics of wave propagation. Allen and Berkley\u2019s image method supplies the physical target\u2014room impulse responses produced by multipath reflections and path-length-dependent delays\u2014while motivating AVR\u2019s goal: a continuous neural field that implicitly encodes these propagation effects and synthesizes IRs at arbitrary listener positions.\nTo make this feasible, AVR leans on advances in neural signal representations that handle high-frequency structure. SIREN motivates architectures capable of representing oscillatory, phase-sensitive fields, and Fourier feature encodings (as popularized in NeRF) stabilize learning of fine spatial and spectral detail required by frequency-domain IRs. Finally, the paper\u2019s spherical integration step is anchored in the ambisonics and spherical microphone array literature (Rafaely), which formalizes aggregation of incoming directional sound components over the sphere. Together, these works converge into AVR\u2019s core innovation: a frequency-domain neural volume rendering formulation with spherical integration that learns an impulse response field encoding acoustic wave propagation, enabling state-of-the-art IR synthesis across positions.",
