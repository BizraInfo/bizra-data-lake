  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014an exact and heuristic characterization of QAOA\u2019s weak-recovery threshold on the spiked tensor model and its equivalence to tensor power iteration at matching depth\u2014rests on two pillars: the statistical structure of spiked tensors and the analytic machinery for constant-depth QAOA. Richard and Montanari\u2019s formulation of the spiked tensor model and analysis of classical algorithms established tensor power iteration as the canonical baseline and highlighted the computational\u2013statistical gap. Complementary results by Perry, Wein, and Bandeira determined information-theoretic thresholds and clarified where polynomial-time methods (including unfolding/spectral approaches) succeed, while Hopkins\u2013Schramm\u2013Shi\u2013Steurer\u2019s SoS lower bounds provided robust evidence for a \u0398(n^{(q\u22122)/4}) computational barrier. Together these works specify the exact classical thresholds the present paper aims to compare against.\nOn the quantum side, Farhi\u2013Goldstone\u2013Gutmann defined QAOA\u2019s structure, and subsequent mean-field analyses for spin-glass models by Farhi\u2013Gamarnik\u2013Gutmann supplied techniques to compute constant-depth performance in disordered Hamiltonians. Leveraging this toolbox, the present work maps QAOA dynamics in the planted p-spin (spiked tensor) landscape to show that 1-step QAOA matches 1-step tensor power iteration, and, heuristically, p-step QAOA matches p-step power iteration for fixed p, implying no asymptotic surpassing of the classical \u0398(n^{(q\u22122)/4}) threshold even when combined with tensor unfolding. These analyses also motivate and validate the reported sine\u2013Gaussian law for asymptotic overlaps, linking QAOA parameter evolutions to explicit limiting distributions.",
