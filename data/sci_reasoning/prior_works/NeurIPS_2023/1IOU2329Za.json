  "synthesis_narrative": "Banana\u2019s core contribution\u2014equivariant point-cloud segmentation with inter-part equivariance obtained as the fixed point of a contracting iteration\u2014emerges from unifying three lines of prior work. First, deep implicit layers and fixed-point training (Deep Equilibrium Models) provide the blueprint to pose inference as solving for a stable equilibrium and to differentiate through it. Banana adopts this perspective but engineers the update operator to be a contraction and strictly SE(3)-equivariant, enabling proofs of per-step equivariance and global convergence. Second, advances in 3D equivariance (Tensor Field Networks, SE(3)-Transformers, and E(n)-equivariant GNNs) supply the architectural tools to ensure rigid-motion symmetry at each iteration. These works demonstrate how features and interactions can be designed so that rotations and translations act predictably\u2014elements Banana leverages to keep its iterative map equivariant. Third, the co-evolution of assignments and transformations has deep roots in both classical registration (Coherent Point Drift\u2019s EM alternation between soft correspondences and rigid alignment) and object-centric grouping (Slot Attention and Capsule Networks), which tie grouping to pose-like parameters under permutation symmetry. Banana synthesizes these ideas by jointly updating soft part labels and per-part SE(3) parameters through an equivariant, contracting operator. This yields a unique, equivariant fixed point that resolves the entanglement between segmentation and per-part motion, operationalizing inter-part equivariance with theoretical guarantees and practical effectiveness.",
