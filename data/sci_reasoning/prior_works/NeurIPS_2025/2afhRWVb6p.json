  "synthesis_narrative": "DiPro\u2019s core advances\u2014region-aware spatiotemporal disentanglement of chest X-ray sequences and hierarchical alignment with asynchronous EHR\u2014stand on two converging lines of prior work. First, video disentanglement frameworks established the blueprint for separating static content from dynamic motion. Denton and Birodkar\u2019s content\u2013pose decomposition and MoCoGAN\u2019s partitioned latent spaces directly motivate DiPro\u2019s split between static anatomical structures and disease-evolving dynamics, a natural fit for serial CXRs where anatomical redundancy can obscure clinically meaningful change. To ensure the dynamics focus on pathology-bearing regions rather than global appearance shifts, DiPro borrows from region-aware localization ideas popularized by Grad-CAM, operationalizing attention to spatially salient, disease-relevant areas during dynamic feature extraction. Second, addressing temporal asynchrony between imaging and EHR draws from sequence alignment and irregular-timing literature. Tsai et al.\u2019s multimodal transformer for unaligned sequences inspires DiPro\u2019s local, interval-level cross-modal synchronization, while time-aware LSTM principles provide mechanisms to respect irregular sampling in clinical data. For coherent trajectories over longer horizons, DiPro\u2019s global alignment echoes continuous-time modeling from Latent ODEs, enabling smooth integration across sparse imaging and denser EHR streams. Finally, the overarching notion of aligning out-of-sync sequences is rooted in DTW, with DiPro extending this classical idea into a learnable, multiscale alignment that jointly optimizes local pairwise and global sequence coherence in a multimodal clinical setting.",
