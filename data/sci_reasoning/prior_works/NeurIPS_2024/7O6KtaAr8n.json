  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014learning social welfare functions (SWFs) from data with provable sample complexity and practical algorithms\u2014stands on two pillars: the normative/economic grounding of the target family and learning-theoretic tools for supervision via scalar labels and pairwise comparisons. On the modeling side, Arrow\u2013Chenery\u2013Minhas\u2013Solow (1961) introduced the CES aggregator, equivalent to a weighted power mean, while Atkinson (1970) tied the exponent to inequality aversion, providing both the functional form and interpretability this paper leverages. Nash (1950) further supplies a canonical special case (geometric mean), anchoring the family with a principled welfare benchmark encompassed by the power mean limits.\n\nOn the learning side, Beigman and Vohra (2006) established a paradigm for inferring economic objectives from observed choices with PAC-style guarantees, which the present work adapts to SWFs, including robustness to noisy supervision. For the comparison-based task\u2014learning from judgments of the form W(u) versus W(v)\u2014Negahban, Oh, and Shah (2012) furnish statistical techniques for learning from noisy pairwise comparisons, while Shah and Wainwright (2016) provide noise-robust algorithms and minimax theory that inform both modeling of noise and performance guarantees. Finally, Noothigattu et al. (2018) demonstrate the feasibility and value of learning normative aggregation rules from human judgments, closely mirroring the paper\u2019s objective of imitating a policymaker\u2019s rationale. Together, these works directly enable the paper\u2019s main results: polynomial sample complexity and practical algorithms for learning power-mean SWFs from both numeric welfare labels and pairwise welfare comparisons under noise.",
