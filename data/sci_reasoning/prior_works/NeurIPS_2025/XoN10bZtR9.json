  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014a concise, tensor-free formulation of Joint Maximum Mean Discrepancy (JMMD) that unifies marginal, class-conditional, and weighted class-conditional alignment and enables subspace learning\u2014rests on two pillars: RKHS discrepancy measures and kernel representer theory. Gretton et al.\u2019s MMD established the RKHS-based distance and unbiased empirical estimators that ground nearly all moment-matching domain adaptation methods. Building on this, Long et al.\u2019s JAN introduced JMMD to align joint distributions via product kernels over multilayer features and predictions, but at the cost of tensor-product operators whose derivatives can be unwieldy. The present work directly tackles this by invoking the generalized representer theorem to express JMMD in finite expansions that obviate explicit tensor products, yielding a form amenable to gradient-based optimization and subspace-learning objectives.\n\nThe unification result is anchored in classic subspace DA methods: TCA\u2019s marginal MMD alignment emerges as JMMD with a constant label kernel; JDA\u2019s class-conditional alignment corresponds to a Kronecker-delta label kernel; and weighted class-conditional variants such as BDA map to JMMD with reweighted label kernels, collectively demonstrating a label-RKHS view that subsumes prior criteria. Finally, the paper\u2019s similarity-weight design draws on HSIC, a kernel dependence measure that naturally induces graphs promoting intra-class compactness. Together, these works shape a principled framework: MMD defines the discrepancy, JAN motivates joint alignment, representer theory removes tensor burdens, subspace DA methods become special cases via label kernels, and HSIC informs graph-based regularization.",
