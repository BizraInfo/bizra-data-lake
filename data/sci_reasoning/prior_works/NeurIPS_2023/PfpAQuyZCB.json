  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014a bi-level framework that learns behavior-alignment reward functions by optimally blending auxiliary rewards with the environment\u2019s primary reward\u2014sits at the intersection of reward shaping, reward learning, and meta-optimization. Classical potential-based reward shaping (Ng, Harada, Russell, 1999) and its practical elaborations (Wiewiora, 2003) supply the canonical approach for densifying feedback while preserving optimal policies in idealized settings. The authors\u2019 systematic evidence that PBRS can nonetheless hinder performance in realistic regimes motivates moving beyond fixed shaping. In parallel, the inverse reinforcement learning lineage (Abbeel & Ng, 2004; Ziebart et al., 2008) established reward functions as parameterized combinations of features and demonstrated that learning their weights can better reflect intended objectives; this paper inherits that parameterization idea but replaces imitation-driven objectives with an outer objective that maximizes true task return. Preference-based reward modeling (Christiano et al., 2017) further reinforces the alignment perspective: to elicit desired behavior, one often must learn the reward rather than handcraft it. Complementing these, auxiliary-task methods (UNREAL; Jaderberg et al., 2016) showed that extra signals can accelerate learning, but typically rely on manually tuned mixtures\u2014precisely the knob this work automates. Finally, meta-gradient reinforcement learning (Xu et al., 2018) provides the bilevel optimization toolkit to differentiate through the inner RL update, enabling principled end-to-end tuning of reward-blend parameters so that training under the shaped signal yields the highest true return. Together, these strands directly inform the paper\u2019s central design: learnable, aligned reward composition optimized via bilevel objectives.",
