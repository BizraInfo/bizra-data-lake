First, BLIP-2 established a powerful recipe for coupling frozen perception backbones to LLMs through learnable queries (Q-Former). JavisGPT generalizes this to the multi-stream setting with synchrony-aware queries, using them not only for comprehension but also as a control interface into a pretrained diffusion transformer generator. LLaVA contributed the instruction-tuning blueprint\u2014GPT-4\u2013curated, multi-turn alignment of perception with language\u2014which JavisGPT extends to audio\u2013video and to generative tasks via its JavisInst-Omni corpus and staged training pipeline.\nSecond, effective cross-modal fusion and alignment principles come from ImageBind and SyncNet. ImageBind motivates projecting heterogeneous signals into a shared space to enable coherent cross-modal attention, while SyncNet formalizes audio\u2013video temporal alignment as a learnable objective. JavisGPT\u2019s SyncFusion explicitly encodes spatio-temporal correspondences so that the LLM reasons over synchronized audio\u2013visual tokens.\nThird, the generative backend is rooted in diffusion modeling advances. DiT provides the transformer-based diffusion backbone and conditioning interface, while AudioLDM and latent video diffusion (Align Your Latents) demonstrate efficient latent conditioning for high-fidelity audio and video synthesis. JavisGPT leverages these to instantiate a pretrained JAV-DiT and to bridge it via learnable queries, yielding a single model capable of instruction-following that both understands and produces synchronized audiovisual content.",
