  "synthesis_narrative": "Low-rank adaptation introduced a simple but powerful update form where weight changes are constrained to BA, enabling efficient fine-tuning while leaving the backbone frozen; crucially, this parameterization can be initialized to target specific directions in weight space. Efficient finetuning of quantized LLMs showed that placing the pretrained weights in 4-bit (e.g., NF4) and training LoRA adapters achieves strong performance with low memory, firmly establishing the combined regime of weight-only PTQ followed by LoRA training. Calibration-based PTQ refined the notion that quantization should minimize discrepancy with the full-precision model\u2019s intermediate outputs by optimizing rounding decisions on small calibration sets, making quantization a reconstruction problem rather than a purely heuristic mapping. For LLMs, Hessian-/reconstruction-aware PTQ demonstrated that minimizing layer output error yields high-fidelity weight-only quantization at scale. Activation-aware schemes further revealed that most quantization harm comes from a few salient directions, suggesting targeted corrections can recover accuracy even under low-bit settings.\nTogether these works suggest two complementary insights: PTQ can be cast as matching full-precision behavior using calibration data, and the dominant quantization error concentrates in a small set of directions that could be corrected efficiently. Given that LoRA provides a trainable low-rank subspace for updates, a natural next step is to perform quantization while solving for a low-rank initialization that reconstructs the full-precision model\u2019s behavior. By aligning the quantizer with the imminent LoRA training, this synthesis closes the observed gap between full fine-tuning and the standard \u201cquantize-then-LoRA\u201d pipeline.",

    "abstract": "Quantization is an indispensable technique for serving Large Language Models (LLMs) and has recently found its way into LoRA fine-tuning (Dettmers et al., 2023). In this work we focus on the scenario where quantization and LoRA fine- tuning are applied together on a pre-trained model. In such cases it is common to observe a consistent gap in the performance on downstream tasks between full fine-tuning and quantization plus LoRA fine-tuning approach. In response, we propose LoftQ (LoRA-Fine-Tuning-aware Quantization), a novel quantization framework that simultaneously quantizes an LLM and finds a proper low-rank initialization for LoRA fine-tuning. Such an initialization alleviates the discrep- ancy between the quantized and full-precision model and significantly improves the generalization in downstream tasks. We evaluate our method on natural lan- guage understanding, question answering, summarization, and natural language generation tasks. Experiments show that our method is highly e",
