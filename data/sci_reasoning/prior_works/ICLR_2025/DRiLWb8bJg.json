  "synthesis_narrative": "Maximum-entropy actor-critic methods established how entropy-regularized objectives stabilize learning with stochastic policies, with Soft Actor-Critic formalizing a practical stochastic actor update under the soft Bellman framework. Stochastic Value Gradients introduced backpropagation through known dynamics via reparameterized action noise, enabling analytic policy gradients when model derivatives are available. End-to-end differentiable physics for learning and control demonstrated that differentiable contact-regularized simulators can train controllers by gradient descent, while highlighting fragility and limited scalability when pushing gradients through stiff contacts and longer horizons. ChainQueen provided analytic gradients for deformable materials via MPM, showing that first-order methods can effectively steer soft-body dynamics when simulator derivatives are accurate. DiffTaichi proved that differentiable simulation kernels can be compiled for high-throughput GPU execution, making gradient-based control more tractable computationally. In parallel, Brax delivered scalable GPU-parallel differentiable rigid-body simulation for RL at scale, but without deformable multiphysics support. Together, these works reveal both the promise and the missing pieces: soft-entropy actor-critic updates benefit from exact gradients, differentiable multiphysics enables those gradients for deformables, and GPU parallelism is essential for RL-scale data. The natural next step is to marry SAC\u2019s stabilized objective with SVG-style analytic gradients sourced from a fast, GPU-parallel differentiable multiphysics engine, explicitly addressing the instability and coverage gaps observed in earlier differentiable-physics control and rigid-only large-scale systems.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in GPU-based parallel simulation have enabled practitioners to collect large amounts of data and train complex control policies using deep reinforcement learning (RL), on commodity GPUs. However, such successes for RL in robotics have been limited to tasks sufficiently simulated by fast rigid-body dynamics. Simulation techniques for soft bodies are comparatively several orders of magnitude slower, thereby limiting the use of RL due to sample complexity requirements. To address this challenge, this paper presents both a novel RL algorithm and a simulation platform to enable scaling RL on tasks involving rigid bodies and deformables. We introduce Soft Analytic Policy Optimization (SAPO), a maximum entropy first-order model-based actor-critic RL algorithm, which uses first-order analytic gradients from differentiable simulation to train a stochastic actor to maximize expected return and entropy. Alongside our approach, we develop Rewarped, a parallel differentiable multiph",
