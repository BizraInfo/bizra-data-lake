  "synthesis_narrative": "Learning policies from preferences emerged by replacing numeric rewards with pairwise trajectory comparisons, as pioneered by preference-based policy learning, which cast control as optimizing behavior consistent with observed preference orders. Deep reinforcement learning from human preferences then operationalized this idea at scale: it fit a reward model via a Bradley\u2013Terry likelihood on trajectory comparisons and optimized the resulting proxy reward, establishing the now-standard MLE-based preference model. Offline variants like B-REX showed that trajectory-level rewards can be inferred from ranked, suboptimal demonstrations and subsequently used for planning, but did so heuristically without finite-sample guarantees or explicit handling of coverage. Independently, robust MDP theory introduced distributionally robust planning over ambiguity sets, providing a template for principled pessimism. Concurrent developments in offline RL highlighted pessimism as essential under partial coverage, and concentrability coefficients from fitted value iteration analysis offered a quantitative lens on coverage and distribution shift. The Bradley\u2013Terry model for paired comparisons provides the statistical backbone for preference likelihoods used in reward estimation.\nTogether, these strands suggested a two-step design: statistically estimate a reward from pairwise preferences with MLE and then counter distribution shift via robust planning. The missing pieces were a coverage notion tailored to single target policies and trajectory-level preferences, and guarantees under general function approximation. By casting ambiguity sets around the MLE reward and introducing a single-policy, trajectory-aware concentrability measure, the current work synthesizes these ideas to deliver polynomial-sample guarantees for any covered target policy in offline preference-based RL.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the problem of offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) with human feedback where feedback is available in the form of preference between trajectory pairs rather than explicit rewards. Our proposed algorithm consists of two main steps: (1) estimate the implicit reward using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with general function approximation from offline data and (2) solve a distributionally robust planning problem over a confidence set around the MLE. We consider the general reward setting where the reward can be defined over the whole trajectory and provide a novel guarantee that allows us to learn any target policy with a polynomial number of samples, as long as the target policy is covered by the offline data. This guarantee is the first of its kind with general function approximation. To measure the coverage of the target policy, we introduce a new single-policy concentrability coefficient, which can be upper bounded by the per-trajec",
