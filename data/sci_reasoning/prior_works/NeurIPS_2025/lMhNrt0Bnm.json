  "synthesis_narrative": "VoxDet\u2019s key contribution is to recast Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) from voxel-wise semantic segmentation into an instance-centric, dense detection problem, supervised by offset fields derived from standard SSC labels. SSCNet established the community\u2019s default formulation\u2014per-voxel semantic classification with dense voxel labels\u2014whose limitations (instance fragmentation and ambiguity) VoxDet targets. Two strands of prior work directly shape VoxDet\u2019s redesign.\nFirst, offset-based instance representations showed how simple supervision can yield strong instance discriminability. Panoptic-DeepLab\u2019s center heatmaps with per-pixel offsets defined a generic way to turn label masks into instance-aware regression targets; VoteNet extended the idea to 3D, using point-to-center voting for grouping and detection. These works motivate VoxDet\u2019s Voxel-to-Instance (VoxNT) trick, which converts voxel-level labels into instance-level offset supervision without extra annotation.\nSecond, dense and center-based object detection provides the architectural lens for SSC. CenterNet demonstrated anchor-free decoupling of classification from center/offset regression, later proven highly effective in 3D by CenterPoint. Operating within voxel grids is supported by VoxelNet\u2019s end-to-end voxel feature learning, while ImVoxelNet shows dense detection directly in voxel space. Synthesizing these insights, VoxDet treats SSC as dense voxel detection: semantic prediction paired with offset regression to implicit instance centers, resolving the instance-level incompleteness and adjacency ambiguities inherent to segmentation-style SSC.",
