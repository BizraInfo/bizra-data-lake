  "synthesis_narrative": "MoCha sits at the intersection of audio-visual synchrony, talking-head generation, and high-quality text-to-video diffusion. The lip-sync lineage begins with SyncNet, which formalized audio\u2013visual synchronization as a learnable signal and provided the de facto evaluation metric. Wav2Lip advanced this by training with a sync expert to deliver robust face-level lip-sync in the wild, but its scope remained limited to facial regions. MakeItTalk and Neural Voice Puppetry further cemented the paradigm of conditioning motion generation on speech/phoneme cues, demonstrating controllable, speaker-aware talking heads\u2014yet again constrained to faces and often with person-specific priors. In parallel, Ginosar et al. showed that speech prosody drives upper-body co-speech gestures, revealing that effective speech conditioning should go beyond lips to capture full-body dynamics.\n\nMoCha directly builds on these insights: it generalizes the speech-conditioned generation problem from face-only to full-portrait, multi-character \u201ctalking characters,\u201d and replaces global sync objectives with a localized audio attention mechanism that aligns specific speech segments to corresponding spatiotemporal video tokens (including lips, hands, and body). To achieve movie-grade realism and action diversity under scarce audio-labeled video, MoCha extends a contemporary text-to-video diffusion backbone in the spirit of VideoCrafter2 and introduces joint training across speech-labeled and text-labeled video data. This co-training bridges the data gap while preserving precise speech\u2013video alignment, yielding synchronized, full-body, dialogue-driven character videos.",
