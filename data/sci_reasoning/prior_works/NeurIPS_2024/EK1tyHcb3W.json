  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper studies how many samples are necessary and sufficient to learn near-optimal sequential posted prices for a single item, across revenue vs. welfare objectives and independent vs. correlated valuations, and it delivers matching upper and lower bounds. Myerson\u2019s optimal auction design provides the canonical revenue benchmark and informs comparisons between posted pricing and optimal auctions. Chawla\u2013Hartline\u2013Malec\u2013Sivan established sequential posted pricing as a central, implementable mechanism class, anchoring the specific policy family whose parameters (prices and ordering) the present work must learn. Dhangwatnotai\u2013Roughgarden\u2013Yan demonstrated that minimal samples can already yield strong revenue via posted prices in i.i.d. settings, motivating sharp, distribution-agnostic sample-complexity characterizations for posted pricing beyond single-sample heuristics. Cole\u2013Roughgarden developed a general framework for auction learning, including lower-bound constructions and uniform-convergence style upper bounds, which this paper tailors to the posted-pricing class to obtain tight rates. Morgenstern\u2013Roughgarden introduced pseudo-dimension methods for simple auctions, providing the learning-theoretic machinery to control sample complexity of parametric mechanism classes such as posted prices. For welfare, Samuel-Cahn\u2019s prophet inequality identifies threshold structures that map naturally to posted prices, guiding the learning targets and concentration analyses. Finally, Cr\u00e9mer\u2013McLean\u2019s insights on correlation highlight that correlated bidders can change identifiability and achievable performance, justifying the paper\u2019s distinct bounds and techniques in the correlated case. Together, these works furnish the mechanism class, benchmarks, structural targets, and learning-theoretic tools that directly enable the paper\u2019s tight sample-complexity characterizations.",
