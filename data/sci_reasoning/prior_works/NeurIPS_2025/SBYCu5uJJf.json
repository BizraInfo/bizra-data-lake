  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014enhancing 3D spatial reasoning in pre-trained VLMs via structured prompting (SpatialMind) and a scalable simulation-derived QA corpus (ScanForgeQA)\u2014emerges from two converging research lines. On the prompting side, Chain-of-Thought established that stepwise textual decomposition elicits latent reasoning capabilities. ViperGPT then showed that visual problems benefit from explicit, program-like structures and tool-using intermediates, inspiring SpatialMind\u2019s interpretable, staged prompts tailored to spatial relations and layouts in videos.\nOn the data side, CLEVR pioneered programmatic QA generation from fully specified scene graphs, ensuring unambiguous supervision for compositional reasoning; CLEVRER extended this paradigm to videos and physical dynamics, aligning closely with the paper\u2019s video-centric spatial focus. Embodied QA further demonstrated that grounding questions in 3D environments trains spatial understanding, motivating the shift from 2D images to embodied/simulated scenes. ProcTHOR supplied the practical pathway to scale: procedurally generating diverse, labeled 3D scenes at scale, exactly the substrate needed for automated QA construction in ScanForgeQA.\nFinally, LLaVA crystallized a lightweight recipe to upgrade multimodal models via instruction tuning without architectural changes, directly validating the paper\u2019s decision to improve spatial reasoning through targeted fine-tuning rather than model redesign. Together, these works catalyze a unified framework where structured prompts guide inference and simulation-built QA supplies abundant, precise supervision for robust 3D spatial understanding from videos.",
