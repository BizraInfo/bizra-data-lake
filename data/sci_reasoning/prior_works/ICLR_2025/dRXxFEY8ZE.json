  "synthesis_narrative": "A dominant thread in audio machine learning has been set by AudioSet, which defined large-scale ontology and training data but suffers from YouTube-link inaccessibility and limited bird-focused evaluation coverage, constraining reproducibility and ecological specificity. BirdCLEF 2021 operationalized the soundscape bird species identification problem with concrete label definitions and protocols, and its soundscapes provided strongly labeled, realistic evaluation material. The open Xeno-canto repository made possible species-labeled recordings at global scale, enabling near-complete taxonomic coverage and large, weakly labeled training sets. BirdNET demonstrated that deep networks can learn from these citizen-science recordings at continental and global scales, validating species-level taxonomies and weak supervision while revealing the absence of a standardized, multi-label, cross-dataset benchmark. BirdVox-full-night contributed a rigorously annotated, nocturnal flight-call corpus capturing a distinct acoustic regime crucial for robustness testing. The Bird Audio Detection Challenge further exposed severe cross-dataset and device-induced covariate shift, underscoring the need for benchmarks that explicitly probe generalization. Meanwhile, PANNs embodied the community\u2019s reliance on AudioSet-pretrained models, suggesting a gap for domain-specific pretraining resources.\nTogether, these works point to an opportunity: aggregate open, species-labeled bird audio at global scale; align with BirdCLEF-style soundscape evaluation; include multiple strongly labeled sets spanning regimes like nocturnal flight calls; and design tasks that probe multi-label classification, covariate shift, and self-supervised learning. Building on Xeno-canto\u2019s breadth and BirdCLEF\u2019s protocols while addressing AudioSet\u2019s accessibility limits and the domain-shift issues highlighted by BAD, a unified, large-scale avian benchmark naturally emerges, enabling fair comparisons to AudioSet-pretrained baselines and fostering reproducible progress in bioacoustic ML.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) has greatly advanced audio classification, yet the field is limited by the scarcity of large-scale benchmark datasets that have propelled progress in other domains. While AudioSet is a pivotal step to bridge this gap as a universal-domain dataset, its restricted accessibility and limited range of evaluation use cases challenge its role as the sole resource. Therefore, we introduce BirdSet, a large-scale benchmark data set for audio classification focusing on avian bioacoustics. BirdSet surpasses AudioSet with over 6,800 recording hours ($\\uparrow17\\%$) from nearly 10,000 classes ($\\uparrow18\\times$) for training and more than 400 hours ($\\uparrow7\\times$) across eight strongly labeled evaluation datasets. It serves as a versatile resource for use cases such as multi-label classification, covariate shift or self-supervised learning. We benchmark six well-known DL models in multi-label classification across three distinct training scenarios and outline further evaluati",
