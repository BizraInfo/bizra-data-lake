Chain-of-Thought Prompting (Wei et al.) established explicit rationale traces as the object of supervision, while Stiennon et al. introduced the reward-modeling framework VersaPRM adapts from outcome-level to step-level scoring. The field\u2019s standard inference-time computation baseline\u2014Self-Consistency (Wang et al.)\u2014motivated VersaPRM\u2019s inference method; VersaPRM directly upgrades majority voting by weighting candidate solutions with PRM scores. To create multi-domain supervision at scale, VersaPRM draws on two pillars of synthetic supervision: STaR (Zelikman et al.), which demonstrated bootstrapping reasoning quality with model-generated rationales, and Constitutional AI (Bai et al.), which validated replacing human labels with reliable AI feedback; Self-Refine (Madaan et al.) further informed VersaPRM\u2019s iterative critique-and-improve loop for annotating intermediate steps. Finally, Qwen2.5-Math-PRM provided the math-specialized PRM baseline and crystallized the gap VersaPRM addresses: math-focused PRMs underperform outside their domain. By integrating these threads\u2014process-level reward modeling, self-consistent inference upgraded with PRM weighting, and scalable AI-mediated rationale supervision\u2014VersaPRM formulates a principled, data-efficient route to a single PRM that consistently improves reasoning across diverse domains.",
