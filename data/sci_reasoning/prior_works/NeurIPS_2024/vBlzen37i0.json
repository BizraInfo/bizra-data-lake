  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014optimal generalization guarantees for learning holomorphic operators between Banach spaces using standard deep networks with encoders/decoders\u2014emerges by unifying three threads. First, operator learning in practice has been driven by Hilbert-space constructions such as DeepONet and Fourier/Neural Operators, which establish feasibility and universal approximation under L2 training but largely restrict analysis and design to Hilbert norms. These works motivate moving beyond L2 to Banach-space settings and clarifying when standard feedforward networks can achieve principled optimality.\nSecond, classical approximation theory for parametric PDEs (Cohen\u2013DeVore\u2013Schwab) shows that many solution operators are holomorphic in parameters and admits sharp n-width/sparse polynomial approximation rates. Reduced-basis/greedy theory in Banach spaces (Binev\u2013Cohen\u2013Dahmen\u2013DeVore\u2013Petrova\u2013Wojtaszczyk) supplies optimal surrogate construction and rate benchmarks outside Hilbert settings. Together, these works define the holomorphic operator class and the exact optimal rates that any learner must attain to be provably optimal in Banach spaces.\nThird, the modern linkage between neural networks and widths (DeVore\u2013Hanin\u2013Petrova) clarifies when network families can realize optimal approximation/generalization rates, while the classical universal approximation of operators (Chen\u2013Chen) justifies targeting operator-level approximation. Building on these, the paper identifies constant-width DNN families paired with arbitrary approximate encoders/decoders that match the n-width rates for holomorphic operators and shows that, under standard L2 training, there exist (indeed, uncountably many) empirical risk minimizers delivering these optimal generalization bounds in Banach spaces.",
