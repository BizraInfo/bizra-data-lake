  "synthesis_narrative": "PITA\u2019s core contribution\u2014progressively annealing Boltzmann targets while applying diffusion smoothing\u2014emerges from unifying two mature lines of work: tempering-based bridging of targets and score-based diffusion sampling. Tempering from AIS and SMC (Neal, 2001; Del Moral et al., 2006) established that sequences of intermediate, higher-temperature distributions make otherwise intractable targets accessible. Score-based diffusion modeling (Song et al., 2021) and its practical sampler, annealed Langevin dynamics (Song & Ermon, 2019), introduced multi-noise smoothing and probability-path design that enable learnable, amortized transitions. Bridge-based diffusion formulations (De Bortoli et al., 2021) further clarified how to connect distributions through diffusions, but also exposed scaling limitations when targets are defined by complex, high-dimensional energies. In parallel, amortized Boltzmann sampling in physical sciences (No\u00e9 et al., 2019; Albergo et al., 2019) demonstrated the promise of learned transport to tackle unnormalized densities, though primarily with normalizing flows and often domain-specific constraints. PITA synthesizes these threads by training a cascade of diffusion models from hot to cold temperatures, using easy samples at high temperature to bootstrap learning at progressively lower temperatures, while diffusion smoothing maintains stability and expressivity of the probability path. This directly addresses the identified gap\u2014scaling diffusion-based samplers to realistic Boltzmann densities\u2014by aligning the annealing schedule (from AIS/SMC) with the diffusion score framework and thereby achieving tractable, amortized sampling for molecular-scale targets.",
