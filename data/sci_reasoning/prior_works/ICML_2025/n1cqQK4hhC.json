  "synthesis_narrative": "STAR\u2019s core advances\u2014preventing codebook collapse in discrete skill learning and explicitly modeling causal relations among skills\u2014emerge from the intersection of discrete representation learning, quantization geometry, and hierarchical control. VQ-VAE established the practicality of vector-quantized codebooks for discrete latents, but also exposed collapse issues; VQ-VAE-2 showed that residual/hierarchical quantization can improve code utilization. STAR adopts residual quantization for skills and tackles collapse head-on by injecting rotation-aware signals into learning. This idea is rooted in two lines of work: optimized product quantization, which learns an orthogonal rotation to reduce quantization distortion before coding, and angular-margin metric learning (e.g., ArcFace), which sculpts embedding geometry by manipulating angles to manage intra-class compactness and inter-class separation. STAR unifies these insights into a rotation-augmented residual skill quantization mechanism that steers gradients based on relative angles, dynamically pushing or pulling embeddings within a code to prevent collapse while promoting diversity.\n\nOn the compositionality side, the options framework formalized learning and composing temporally extended behaviors, while DIAYN popularized learning diverse skills without task rewards. STAR builds upon these to learn diverse, reusable skill abstractions, and it further grounds composition in causality. By drawing on the spirit of skill chaining\u2014where precondition-effect structure connects skills\u2014STAR\u2019s causal skill component models directed dependencies between learned skills, enabling robust sequencing for long-horizon manipulation. Together, these strands converge into a stable, diverse, and causally coherent skill-learning framework.",
