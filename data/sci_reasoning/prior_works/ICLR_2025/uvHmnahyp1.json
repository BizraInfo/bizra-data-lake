  "synthesis_narrative": "Generative Flow Networks were introduced to sample from unnormalized reward distributions over sequential construction processes, providing a principled way to generate diverse sets of high-reward objects rather than collapsing to a few modes. Trajectory Balance subsequently gave a stable, path-consistent training objective for GFlowNets, enabling learning over long horizons with many alternative construction paths. In molecular design, equivariant 3D-conditional GFlowNets showed that this framework yields markedly higher diversity while optimizing property-driven objectives, establishing GFlowNets as a strong fit for chemistry search spaces. In parallel, synthesis planning work formalized the use of reaction templates with buyable starting materials to define practically actionable chemical routes, anchoring the notion that generation constrained by executable reactions can bridge in silico proposals and lab feasibility. Reaction-based generative design, exemplified by Lib-INVENT, operationalized this by building molecules through reaction filters and catalog reagents, but trained with RL that often forfeits diversity. Earlier SMILES/RL and graph VAEs improved validity or property scores but relied on heuristic synthesizability terms or none at all, frequently yielding non-synthesizable outputs.\nTogether these strands point to a natural opportunity: marry the practical guarantees of reaction-constrained construction with the mode-covering sampling of GFlowNets. By treating forward reaction applications on purchasable reactants as actions and training with Trajectory Balance, the current work synthesizes these insights to produce diverse, property-optimized molecules that are executable by construction, while also confronting reaction-encoding issues that arise when navigating the resulting MDP.",

    "abstract": "Generative models see increasing use in computer-aided drug design. However, while performing well at capturing distributions of molecular motifs, they often produce synthetically inaccessible molecules. To address this, we introduce SynFlowNet, a GFlowNet model whose action space uses chemical reactions and buyable reactants to sequentially build new molecules. By incorporating forward synthesis as an explicit constraint of the generative mechanism, we aim at bridging the gap between in silico molecular generation and real world synthesis capabilities. We evaluate our approach using synthetic accessibility scores and an independent retrosynthesis tool to assess the synthesizability of our compounds, and motivate the choice of GFlowNets through considerable improvement in sample diversity compared to baselines. Additionally, we identify challenges with reaction encodings that can complicate traversal of the MDP in the backward direction. To address this, we introduce various strategies",
