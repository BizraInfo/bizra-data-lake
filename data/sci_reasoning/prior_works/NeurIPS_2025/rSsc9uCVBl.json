  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper advances the general \u03a6-regret paradigm, where performance is measured against action-transformations, by delivering improved comparator-adaptive bounds with simpler algorithms. Its immediate antecedent is Lu et al. (2025), which introduced comparator-adaptivity via a sparsity-based complexity of the transformation; the present work replaces that machinery with a principled prior over binary transformations, yielding tighter, prior-dependent guarantees and cleaner algorithms. This prior-centric move is rooted in the exponential-weights literature (Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi, 2006), where initializing Hedge with nonuniform priors leads to regret scaling with the comparator\u2019s prior mass; the authors lift this idea from experts to transformation comparators, identifying a specific prior that suffices for binary mappings.\n\nThe transformation viewpoint itself traces to classical internal/swap regret frameworks (Blum and Mansour, 2007; Stoltz and Lugosi, 2005), which formalized competing against mappings of actions and provided reductions and algorithms that the current work generalizes and unifies under \u03a6-regret. To make the approach computationally viable over exponentially many transformations, the paper leverages kernelized Hedge (Farina et al., 2022), combining multiple copies to efficiently implement the prior-weighted aggregation over binary transformations. Finally, the game-theoretic significance (Hart and Mas-Colell, 2000) underlies the applications: improved and simpler \u03a6-regret algorithms directly strengthen convergence guarantees to correlated (and related) equilibria. Together, these threads\u2014comparator adaptivity, prior-based Hedge, transformation regret, and kernelized efficiency\u2014culminate in sharper bounds and streamlined methods for \u03a6-regret and its game-theoretic applications.",
