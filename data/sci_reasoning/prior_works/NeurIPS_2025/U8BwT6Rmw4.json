  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014optimizing the Franz\u2013Parisi (FP) criterion to better encode overlap geometry and proving its equivalence to Statistical Query (SQ) lower bounds\u2014rests on two pillars: the FP/low-degree lineage and the SQ lower-bound framework. The FP strand begins with the Franz\u2013Parisi potential from spin-glass theory (Franz\u2013Parisi, 1995), which quantifies the overlap landscape. Bandeira et al. (2022) imported an annealed variant of this potential into high-dimensional inference, formulating the FP criterion and showing it matches low-degree polynomial (LDP) lower bounds in Gaussian additive models. The low-degree methodology (Hopkins, 2018) and its subsequent consolidation (e.g., expositions on low-degree likelihood-ratio and \u03c7^2 geometry) clarified how computational barriers are captured by low-degree projections of the likelihood ratio and by overlap/correlation structures\u2014precisely the aspects refined by the optimized FP criterion here.\n\nOn the SQ side, Kearns (1998) introduced the SQ model, and Feldman et al. (2013) developed powerful lower-bound machinery (statistical dimension/average correlation) for detection tasks like planted clique. Feldman (2017) further provided general characterizations of SQ complexity via correlation and \u03c7^2 metrics. These SQ tools connect algorithmic hardness to geometric properties of distributions. The present work leverages these insights to align the optimized FP potential\u2014now more faithful to overlap geometry\u2014with SQ lower bounds under mild, checkable assumptions across broad model classes (e.g., Gaussian additive, planted sparse). In effect, it unifies FP\u2019s physics-inspired overlap perspective with SQ\u2019s algorithmic complexity lens, extending the earlier FP\u2013LDP equivalence to a foundational algorithm class.",
