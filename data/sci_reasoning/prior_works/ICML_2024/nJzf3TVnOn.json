  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014an adaptive, fixed\u2011confidence online experimental design for finite\u2011sample causal discovery\u2014sits at the intersection of identifiability from interventions and pure\u2011exploration bandit methodology. The identifiability side is anchored by Eberhardt, Glymour, and Scheines\u2019 worst\u2011case analysis showing that interventions that cut every edge suffice to determine a DAG, the very notion formalized and operationalized through interventional Markov equivalence classes (I\u2011MECs) by Hauser and B\u00fchlmann. Subsequent combinatorial works made this constructive: Shanmugam et al. provided tight bounds and constructions for separating systems under constraints on intervention sizes, while Ghassami et al. framed the selection of such interventions as a budgeted, offline design problem. These lines collectively establish the feasibility and structure of the intervention family the current work restricts to.\nOn the sequential decision\u2011making side, the algorithmic blueprint is imported from best\u2011arm identification in bandits. Garivier and Kaufmann\u2019s Track\u2011and\u2011Stop methodology\u2014tracking optimal allocation proportions defined by a Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence program and stopping via a GLR criterion\u2014directly informs the paper\u2019s \u201callocation matching\u201d rule and its fixed\u2011confidence termination condition. Chernoff\u2019s classical theory supplies the statistical backbone of the GLR stopping analysis. By marrying separating\u2011system\u2011based identifiability with track\u2011and\u2011stop style pure exploration, the paper advances from offline, infinite\u2011sample assumptions to an adaptive procedure that judiciously allocates a finite intervention budget and provably stops once the causal graph is learned with a target confidence.",
