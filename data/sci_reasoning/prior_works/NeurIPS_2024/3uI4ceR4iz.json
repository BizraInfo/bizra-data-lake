  "synthesis_narrative": "SA3DIP targets the emerging pipeline for open-world 3D instance segmentation that projects 2D foundation model predictions into 3D and merges geometric primitives. Segment Anything (Kirillov et al., 2023) enabled strong zero-shot multi-view mask proposals, but its part-level bias often fragments objects. OpenMask3D crystallized a practical SAM-driven multi-view-to-3D instance workflow, highlighting performance gains but also the brittleness of heavy 2D heuristics. On the 3D side, Superpoint Graphs (Landrieu & Simonovsky, 2018) and subsequent superpoint-based instance segmentation like Mask3D (Schult et al., 2023) showed the effectiveness of primitive-level reasoning, yet typically constructed primitives from normals and spatial cues, leading to under-segmentation for instances with similar geometry.\n\nTwo additional threads motivate SA3DIP\u2019s core idea of \u201cpotential 3D priors.\u201d VCCS (Papon et al., 2013) demonstrated that fusing appearance with geometry yields more reliable 3D over-segmentation, foreshadowing SA3DIP\u2019s complementary primitive generation that goes beyond normals. Meanwhile, OpenScene (Huang et al., 2023) showed how to aggregate multi-view semantics into 3D; SA3DIP repurposes such cues as 3D potentials that guide both primitive formation and merging. By combining multi-view 2D guidance with richer 3D priors, SA3DIP reduces over-reliance on SAM and alleviates part-level over-segmentation, while overcoming the ambiguity of purely geometry-driven superpoints. The result is a more balanced zero-shot 3D instance segmentation pipeline that integrates geometric, photometric, and semantic evidence directly in 3D.",
