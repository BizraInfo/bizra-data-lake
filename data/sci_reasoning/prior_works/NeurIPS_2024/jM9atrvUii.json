  "synthesis_narrative": "Kermut\u2019s core contribution\u2014a supervised Gaussian process model with a composite kernel that encodes mutation similarity and epistasis while yielding calibrated posterior uncertainty\u2014builds on a confluence of ideas from kernel methods, GP modeling, and protein variant prediction. The GP framework of Rasmussen and Williams provides the mathematical backbone for nonparametric regression and principled uncertainty quantification. Haussler\u2019s convolution kernels motivate constructing valid kernels over structured objects, enabling Kermut to define similarity directly over sets of mutations rather than entire sequences. To capture the structure of genotype\u2013phenotype maps, Kermut adopts an additive/interactions perspective akin to Additive Gaussian Processes, allowing main effects of single substitutions and low-order epistatic interactions to be composed cleanly within the kernel.\nIn encoding biologically meaningful similarity, the spectrum/string-kernel tradition (Leslie et al.) demonstrates how sequence-derived similarity boosts predictive performance, while BLOSUM substitution matrices supply a long-standing prior that not all amino-acid changes are equal\u2014guiding Kermut\u2019s mutation-similarity term. Empirically, earlier applications of GPs to protein fitness landscapes (Romero, Krause, Arnold) validated GPs\u2019 suitability for supervised sequence\u2013function learning and highlighted the utility of predictive uncertainty for design and exploration. Finally, the EVE framework crystallized the community\u2019s emphasis on uncertainty in variant-effect prediction; Kermut advances this agenda by delivering supervised state-of-the-art accuracy together with GP posterior uncertainties and an analysis of calibration, enabled by its biologically grounded composite kernel.",
