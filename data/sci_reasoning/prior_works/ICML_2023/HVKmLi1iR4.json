  "synthesis_narrative": "BPipe emerges from the maturation of pipeline parallel training and the practical difficulties observed at GPT-3 scale. GPipe established the micro-batch pipeline abstraction that enables high utilization but also accumulates activations per stage, creating uneven memory pressure when layers have heterogeneous footprints. PipeDream then introduced 1F1B scheduling to reduce bubbles and cap activation lifetimes, yet scheduling alone could not address persistent inter-stage memory skew. Megatron-LM operationalized pipeline+tensor parallelism for large Transformers and became the de facto baseline for LLM training, where practitioners observed that stages containing embeddings and output layers disproportionately strain memory. Megatron\u2019s subsequent large-scale study explicitly surfaced these imbalances and the limits of scheduling/interleaving to smooth them, directly motivating BPipe\u2019s core idea: move intermediate activations between GPUs to equalize per-stage memory. Prior memory-saving approaches such as activation checkpointing deliver relief by recomputation, trading performance for capacity; BPipe instead seeks to eliminate such recompute overhead by exploiting fast GPU\u2013GPU transfers to redistribute activation buffers. Finally, while ZeRO efficiently partitions parameter and optimizer states, it does not solve activation-driven imbalance intrinsic to pipeline execution; BPipe fills this gap by targeting the remaining dominant component\u2014activations\u2014so that micro-batch sizes can be increased and redundant recomputation avoided, yielding higher throughput on large language model training.",
