  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation is to give the first theoretical and numerically efficient privacy guarantees for random k-out-of-t allocation by reducing it to well-studied independent (Poisson) subsampling. This lineage starts with Abadi et al., who established Poisson-subsampled DP-SGD and its accounting\u2014creating the baseline mechanism whose guarantees this work uses as an upper bound for the allocation scheme. Mironov\u2019s R\u00e9nyi Differential Privacy provides the analytic framework for tight comparison and composition across many steps, while Kairouz\u2013Oh\u2013Viswanath\u2019s optimal composition results ground the conversion from step-wise to end-to-end guarantees and inform efficient numerical accounting. Wang\u2013Balle\u2013Kasiviswanathan\u2019s Subsampled RDP gives sharp privacy bounds for Poisson subsampling and the Analytical Moments Accountant; these become the precise tools enabling the paper\u2019s clean upper bound and scalable estimation without Monte Carlo. Prior analyses of random allocation leaned on shuffling-based amplification (Erlingsson et al.), which the authors identify as too conservative for this setting\u2014explicitly motivating their tighter reduction to independent subsampling. Finally, Feldman et al.\u2019s privacy amplification by iteration clarifies how iterative, selectively applied updates can strengthen privacy, conceptually informing the treatment of k active steps among t. Together, these works directly enable the paper\u2019s main contribution: principled, tight, and computationally practical privacy guarantees for random allocation that replace ad hoc shuffling bounds and costly simulations.",
