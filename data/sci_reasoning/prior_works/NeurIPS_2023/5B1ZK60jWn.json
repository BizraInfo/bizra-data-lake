  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s central contribution is to bring a modern spectral learning-curve theory of regression to the long-standing problem of predicting biological neural responses from deep network activations, and to use this to parse prediction error into interpretable geometric factors. This builds most directly on recent kernel/regression theory by Bordelon, Canatar, and Pehlevan, which shows that generalization is governed by the kernel (or feature) eigenspectrum and the target\u2019s projection onto corresponding eigenfunctions. Their follow-up on spectral bias and task\u2013model alignment extends these ideas to deep networks, providing the precise alignment constructs and intuition the present work repurposes for neural prediction.\n\nConceptually, Saxe, McClelland, and Ganguli\u2019s mode-wise analysis of learning dynamics in deep linear networks underpins the idea that learning and error decompose along spectral modes, motivating an eigenvector-alignment view. On the neuroscience side, the encoding-model tradition (Naselaris et al.) and performance-optimized model-to-brain prediction (Yamins/DiCarlo) established linear regression from model features to neural responses as the standard evaluation; the new paper retains this setup but explains its generalization behavior spectrally. Brain-Score\u2019s observation that many modern models achieve similar neural predictivity provides the practical motivation to look beyond aggregate scores, while representation similarity work such as CKA (Kornblith et al.) demonstrates the utility of geometric alignment measures across models. Integrating these threads, the paper formalizes how a model\u2019s eigenspectrum, its eigenvector alignment with neural targets, and dataset size jointly determine neural prediction error, yielding principled geometric diagnostics to distinguish models that otherwise tie on standard neural metrics.",
