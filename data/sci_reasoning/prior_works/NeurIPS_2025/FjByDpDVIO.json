  "synthesis_narrative": "Audio Flamingo 3 synthesizes three critical lines of prior work: (1) the Flamingo family\u2019s modality-bridging architecture, (2) large-scale audio representation learning, and (3) instruction-tuned reasoning in LLMs. Flamingo introduced gated cross-attention to couple modality encoders with an LLM for in-context multimodal reasoning; OpenFlamingo made that blueprint fully open and reproducible. AF3 inherits this interface and training philosophy, but replaces the vision encoder with AF-Whisper, transforming the stack into an audio-first system that can accept multiple audio inputs across turns.\nOn the audio side, Whisper demonstrated robust large-scale weakly supervised speech encoding; AF3 extends this lineage by retraining a Whisper-style encoder to jointly represent speech, environmental sounds, and music, taking cues from CLAP\u2019s contrastive alignment across heterogeneous audio. This unification removes the need for multi-encoder fusion popularized by early audio-LLMs such as SALMONN, simplifying integration and improving generalization to long, multi-domain audio.\nFor capability scaling, AF3 borrows the staged alignment and instruction-tuning recipe exemplified by LLaVA, curating AF-Chat and AF-Think to align the model to conversational and reasoning behaviors. Chain-of-Thought prompting provides the mechanism for AF3\u2019s on-demand thinking, enabling the model to deliberate before answering when tasks require complex audio reasoning. Together, these influences yield a fully open, Flamingo-style audio-language model with a unified encoder, multi-turn multi-audio dialogue, long-audio comprehension, and optional CoT-based reasoning, advancing state of the art across speech, sound, and music understanding.",
