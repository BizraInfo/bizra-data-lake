  "synthesis_narrative": "CLASH\u2019s core contribution\u2014early stopping for harm that is sensitive to treatment effect heterogeneity\u2014arises by fusing two mature literatures: sequential monitoring from clinical trials/online testing and causal machine learning for heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE). On the monitoring side, the O\u2019Brien\u2013Fleming boundaries and the Lan\u2013DeMets alpha\u2011spending framework establish how to control Type I error across repeated interim looks; Johari\u2013Pekelis\u2013Walsh adapt these ideas to anytime\u2011valid inference in A/B testing. CLASH inherits this sequential validity but redirects it from aggregate effects to subgroup\u2011specific harm, the locus where conventional procedures can miss minority harms.\nOn the HTE side, causal forests (Wager & Athey) and causal trees (Athey & Imbens) provide honest, data\u2011adaptive subgroup discovery and asymptotically valid CATE estimation. Meta\u2011learners (K\u00fcnzel et al.) generalize this into a modular plug\u2011in architecture, allowing CLASH to be broadly applicable across learners and outcomes. Because adaptive subgroup learning can bias inference, CLASH leverages orthogonalization and cross\u2011fitting from double/debiased machine learning (Chernozhukov et al.) to preserve valid uncertainty quantification when combining flexible learners with sequential testing. Together, these components yield a principled procedure that repeatedly learns who is at risk, monitors those groups with proper spending of statistical error, and stops promptly when harm manifests\u2014even if confined to a minority subgroup\u2014thereby closing a gap left by aggregate early\u2011stopping methods in both clinical trials and online experiments.",
