  "synthesis_narrative": "ArcFace established hyperspherical embedding with an additive angular margin, prioritizing inter-class angular separation while largely ignoring the structure of intra-class subspaces. Center Loss introduced an explicit intra-class compactness term, reinforcing the notion that identity discrimination benefits from shaping within-class feature distributions, albeit by collapsing intra-class variability. Sub-center ArcFace moved beyond a single center by assigning multiple prototypes per class to capture intra-class variation, but still interpreted variation as clusters around representative prototypes rather than structured complementary directions. MagFace uncovered a tight association between embedding magnitude and image/identity quality and introduced magnitude-aware regularization to calibrate representations. AdaFace further operationalized this idea by adapting margins based on feature norms, showing that norm-aware modulation improves discrimination under varying sample qualities. Beyond single-model objectives, Deep Mutual Learning revealed that different networks, even with similar training goals, encode complementary information, indicating that embeddings from models of differing strengths can occupy partially orthogonal subspaces.\n\nTaken together, these works suggest three converging opportunities: margin-centric training under-exploits intra-class subspace structure, feature magnitude is a useful quality signal, and different models contain complementary cues. Building on these insights, the current work orthogonally decomposes a superior model\u2019s embedding along a weaker model\u2019s embedding to expose a discriminative residual direction, enforces an intra-class incoherence constraint to maintain complementary sub-features, and leverages norm\u2013quality principles to rescale component magnitudes before vector recombination. This synthesis naturally extends beyond prototype clustering and pure margin enlargement by reshaping the representation space to preserve and exploit complementary intra-class evidence while retaining strong discriminability.",

While existing FR algorithms primarily focus on optimizing margins and loss functions, limited attention has been given to exploring the feature representation space. Therefore, this paper endeavors to improve FR performance in the view of feature representation space. Firstly, we consider two FR models that exhibit distinct performance discrepancies, where one model exhibits superior recognition accuracy compared to the other. We implement orthogonal decomposition on the features from the superior model along those from the inferior model and obtain two sub-features. Surprisingly, we find the sub-feature perpendicular to the inferior still possesses a certain level of face distinguishability. We adjust the modulus of the sub-features and recombine them through vector addition. Experiments demonstrate this recombination is likely to contribute to an ",
