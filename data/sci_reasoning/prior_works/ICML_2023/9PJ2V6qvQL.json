      "relationship_sentence": "Jia et al. operationalize Shapley-based data valuation (e.g., TMC- and KNN-Shapley) and provide practical baselines for marginal contribution; the current paper adapts this machinery from a single scalar payoff to separate, directional measurements of outflow and inflow to study reciprocity."

  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014decomposing the value exchange in pooled learning into inflows, outflows, and a reciprocity metric\u2014emerges by fusing two lines of prior work: data valuation and influence analysis. Data Shapley framed the foundational question of how much a contributor\u2019s data is \u201cworth\u201d to a learned model by marginal contribution. However, Shapley-style approaches collapse all effects into a single scalar payoff, obscuring who benefits from whom. Jia et al. provided efficient and practical estimators for these marginal contributions, which this paper repurposes to compute directional effects rather than a single aggregate value. The shift from aggregate to directional value is catalyzed by influence-function methodology: Koh and Liang\u2019s infinitesimal up-weighting formalism naturally defines pairwise effects of one entity\u2019s data on another entity\u2019s loss, the building block for inflow and outflow. For the theoretical reciprocity results, the paper leans on classical regression diagnostics\u2014Cook\u2019s distance and the symmetry of the hat matrix\u2014to show that in linear and related models under certain distributional assumptions, these pairwise effects are approximately symmetric, yielding reciprocity. Finally, Agnostic Federated Learning provides the formal setting of multiple entity distributions and their mixtures, which the present work adopts to precisely define benefits from pooled versus local data. Together, these works directly shape the problem formulation, measurement tools, and theoretical underpinnings of inflow, outflow, and reciprocity.",
