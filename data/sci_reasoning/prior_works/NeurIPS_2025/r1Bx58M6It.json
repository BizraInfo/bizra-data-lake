  "synthesis_narrative": "SW-Guidance\u2019s key contribution\u2014training-free, palette-consistent image generation by injecting a differentiable sliced 1-Wasserstein color objective into the diffusion sampler\u2014emerges from two converging lines of work: gradient-based diffusion guidance and optimal-transport color alignment. The diffusion backbone of Ho et al. (DDPM) provides the reverse-time update rule that can be perturbed by auxiliary gradients. Dhariwal and Nichol\u2019s classifier guidance establishes the general recipe for steering the sampling path using \u2207x log p(y|x), while Ho and Salimans\u2019 classifier-free guidance clarifies how guidance strength modulates semantic adherence during sampling. In parallel, the optimal-transport literature on color manipulation\u2014particularly Ferradans et al.\u2014demonstrates that 1-Wasserstein distances capture perceptually meaningful discrepancies between color distributions, yielding stable color transfer. Bonneel et al. supply the computational tool: sliced Wasserstein computes these OT objectives efficiently and differentiably via random projections, making them amenable to backpropagation.\nBridging these threads, Chung and Ye\u2019s diffusion posterior sampling shows how to incorporate arbitrary differentiable data-consistency terms into the reverse dynamics without retraining, effectively treating them as likelihood energies. SW-Guidance instantiates this idea for color conditioning: it defines a sliced 1-Wasserstein energy between the generated image\u2019s color distribution and the reference palette and injects its gradient into each denoising step. The result is a principled, training-free sampler that aligns colors while preserving semantic fidelity to the text prompt, improving over post-hoc color transfer or ad-hoc heuristics.",
