  "synthesis_narrative": "FRE\u2019s central move is to treat a task as an unknown reward function and to infer a compact representation of that function from a few state\u2013reward samples, then act conditioned on this representation. This functional, few-shot perspective is grounded in Neural Processes, which formalize amortized inference over functions from context pairs; FRE adapts this mechanism to reward functions by using a transformer VAE that encodes sets of state\u2013reward observations. The choice of a transformer set encoder follows Set Transformer\u2019s permutation-invariant attention design, enabling robust aggregation of variable-size support sets.\n\nOn the control side, FRE inherits from meta-RL the idea of a latent task variable inferred from data. PEARL established probabilistic context embeddings for fast adaptation; FRE retains that latent conditioning but replaces online interaction with pretraining over many unsupervised reward functions and zero-shot conditioning at test time. UVFA and successor features/GPI provide the conceptual backbone for zero-shot generalization across reward specifications by conditioning policies on task descriptors; FRE generalizes beyond explicit goal vectors (UVFA) and linear rewards (successor features) by learning nonlinear functional encodings from data.\n\nFinally, FRE\u2019s data strategy echoes HER and DIAYN. Like HER, it repurposes trajectories under alternative reward definitions, and like DIAYN, it embraces unsupervised pretraining to prepare for downstream tasks. Together, these strands yield a scalable, offline, zero-shot RL agent that can rapidly solve novel tasks from a handful of reward-annotated examples.",
