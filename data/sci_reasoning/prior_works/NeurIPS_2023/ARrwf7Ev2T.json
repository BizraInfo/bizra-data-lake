  "synthesis_narrative": "Dense and Aligned Captions (DAC) is rooted in the trajectory of vision\u2013language pretraining and the growing realization that large-scale contrastive learning on web alt-text leaves models with an object-centric, \u201cbag of nouns\u201d bias. CLIP established the dominant paradigm but also exposed the limitations DAC aims to fix. ALBEF and BLIP advanced the field by showing that better alignment and data curation\u2014via image\u2013text matching, caption generation, and filtering\u2014substantially improve representations; DAC generalizes this principle by explicitly targeting two caption properties most relevant to compositionality: image-alignment and density (rich inclusion of attributes and relations). The empirical motivation comes from compositional evaluation suites like Winoground and ARO, which highlighted failures in attribute binding, relational reasoning, and sensitivity to word order\u2014precisely the competencies DAC\u2019s captions are crafted to teach. DataComp further cemented the centrality of data quality, demonstrating that careful selection and processing of training pairs often outweigh architectural tweaks, thereby validating DAC\u2019s data-centric strategy. Finally, Visual Genome\u2019s dense, relationship-rich annotations provided a blueprint for what effective compositional supervision can look like, inspiring DAC\u2019s move toward dense, fine-grained captions but achieved through scalable automatic generation and alignment. Together, these works converge on the insight that improving the fidelity and granularity of captions\u2014rather than solely altering model objectives\u2014can substantially elevate compositional reasoning in VLMs.",
