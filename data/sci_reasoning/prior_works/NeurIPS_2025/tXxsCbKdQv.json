  "synthesis_narrative": "Compress to Impress marries three intellectual threads: (1) LASER\u2019s observation that selectively reducing matrix ranks can improve downstream accuracy without conventional fine-tuning, (2) the LoRA family\u2019s low-rank view of LLM adaptation, and (3) one-shot, gradient-based sensitivity scoring from pruning literature. LASER established the payoff of layer-selective rank reduction but incurred prohibitive cost via exhaustive, per-matrix searches; the present work preserves LASER\u2019s target (prune high-order components where beneficial) but replaces the search with a single gradient step that scores matrices by the gradients of their singular values. This leap is conceptually aligned with SNIP\u2019s single-batch saliency and practically enabled by differentiable SVD machinery (Ionescu et al.), allowing singular-value\u2013aware signals to guide selection.\nBuilding on LoRA\u2019s premise that updates lie in low-rank subspaces, and AdaLoRA\u2019s insight that rank budgets should be allocated where sensitivity warrants, the method extends sensitivity scoring to the spectral domain and uses it to both choose a small subset of matrices and decide how much to reduce each. Classic SVD-based compression (Denton et al.) motivates focusing on high-order components and inspires the proposed cluster-wise, multi-subspace factorization, which mitigates overfitting relative to a single global subspace. Finally, the finding that 100 examples suffice echoes intrinsic-dimension results (Aghajanyan et al.), justifying why a tiny probe set can reliably steer adaptation. Together, these works directly scaffold the paper\u2019s core contribution: a gradient-spectral, one-step protocol that makes layer-selective rank reduction practical and more accurate.",
