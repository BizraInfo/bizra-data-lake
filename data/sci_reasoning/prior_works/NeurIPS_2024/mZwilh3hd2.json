  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014a general ellipsoid-style framework that computes exact \u03a6-equilibria (saddle points) in polyhedral bilinear zero-sum games even when one dimension is exponentially large and only a good-enough-response oracle is available\u2014emerges by synthesizing several direct precedents. The Ellipsoid Against Hope of Papadimitriou and Roughgarden pioneered the use of separation oracles to compute exact correlated equilibria in succinct games. Jiang and Leyton-Brown formalized the polynomial-type condition that ensures EAH\u2019s applicability in compact representations, delineating the boundary that extensive-form games typically violate. Huang\u2019s adaptation showed that, despite failing polynomial type, one can still engineer EAH-like machinery to compute exact extensive-form correlated equilibria, foreshadowing the present paper\u2019s broader generalization.\n\nOn the modeling side, the sequence-form representation of Koller, Megiddo, and von Stengel supplies the polyhedral and bilinear structure that allows extensive-form (and related) games to be cast as saddle-point problems with exponentially many pure strategies but polynomially describable convex strategy sets. Forges and von Stengel\u2019s EFCE concept identifies a central target equilibrium notion within the \u03a6-equilibria family that the new algorithm explicitly handles. The theoretical backbone is the separation\u2013optimization equivalence from Gr\u00f6tschel\u2013Lov\u00e1sz\u2013Schrijver, enabling ellipsoid-based handling of exponentially large spaces via oracles. Finally, the oracle-driven ethos of Grigoriadis\u2013Khachiyan\u2014solving large games using (approximate) response oracles\u2014directly inspires the paper\u2019s key relaxation to a good-enough-response oracle while still attaining exact solutions through refined cutting-plane/ellipsoid control. Collectively, these works converge to make exact, polynomial-time computation of \u03a6-equilibria in polyhedral games feasible.",
