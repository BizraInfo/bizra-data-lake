  "synthesis_narrative": "The core contribution of Representation-Conditioned Generation (RCG) is to close the long-standing quality gap between unconditional and conditional image generation by conditioning on semantic features learned without labels. Dhariwal and Nichol (2021) crystallized this gap, showing that class-conditional diffusion with guidance far outperforms unconditional models; RCG directly targets this by providing semantic conditioning without human annotations. Architecturally, RCG builds on the conditioning mechanisms popularized by Latent Diffusion Models (Rombach et al., 2022)\u2014cross-attending to external embeddings in a compact latent space\u2014while changing the source of semantics.\n\nThe key insight is inspired by two lines of prior work. First, unCLIP (Ramesh et al., 2022) illustrated that generating in a semantic embedding space and then decoding with a diffusion model yields strong fidelity and control; RCG preserves this two-stage design but replaces text-supervised CLIP embeddings with self-supervised visual representations. Second, advances in self-supervised learning such as MoCo (Chen et al., 2020), DINO (Caron et al., 2021), and MAE (He et al., 2022) established that label-free encoders can learn features with rich, class-like semantics. RCG leverages these encoders both as the target distribution to model in representation space and as the conditioning signal for image synthesis.\n\nFinally, the decoupling principle from VQGAN (Esser et al., 2021)\u2014separating high-level latent modeling from pixel rendering\u2014provides a practical template that RCG adapts to continuous, semantically meaningful SSL embeddings. Together, these works directly enable RCG\u2019s label-free yet semantically conditioned generation paradigm.",
