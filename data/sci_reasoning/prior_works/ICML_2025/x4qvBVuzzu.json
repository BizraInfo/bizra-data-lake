  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014recasting parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) from weight updates to forward state perturbations with a parallel-control pathway\u2014emerges directly from two converging lines of work. First, LoRA established that small low-rank adapters can achieve strong adaptation while freezing base weights, but its weight-centric design still imposes activation memory and compute overheads at modified projections. Second, adapter and prompt-based methods shifted attention toward manipulating intermediate states: Houlsby-style adapters defined the general practice of inserting compact modules within residual blocks; Prefix-Tuning and P-Tuning v2 showed that controlling hidden states (e.g., via K/V prefixes or layerwise prompts) can substitute for weight updates and scale competitively.\n\nThis paper synthesizes these insights by formalizing a state-based tuning framework that treats LoRA as a special case while generalizing the intervention locus from specific weights to entire forward states. The \u2018parallel control\u2019 concept draws inspiration from residual adapters\u2019 parallel branches, enabling an additive pathway that perturbs the residual stream across the whole block. Conceptually, this achieves two aims absent in prior work: (1) unified, block-level control of activations that subsumes weight-local updates, and (2) concrete memory benefits by avoiding storage of large intermediate states during backpropagation through the frozen backbone. QLoRA contextualizes the practical gap\u2014quantization reduces weight memory yet leaves activation memory largely intact\u2014which the proposed state-based approach directly addresses. Together, these works form the immediate intellectual lineage for the paper\u2019s shift from weight-based to state-based PEFT with parallel control.",
