  "synthesis_narrative": "Prior SSL work established both methodological norms and the fragility of common assumptions. Realistic Evaluation of Deep Semi-Supervised Learning Algorithms codified fair protocols\u2014strong supervised baselines, careful tuning, and standardized pipelines\u2014ensuring claims about SSL hold under practical scrutiny. FixMatch introduced confidence-thresholded consistency with strong/weak augmentations, becoming the dominant template for modern SSL. ReMixMatch added distribution alignment and advanced augmentation, but implicitly leaned on matched class distributions between labeled and unlabeled sets. OpenMatch formalized open-set SSL where unknown-class outliers exist in unlabeled data, proposing inlier-only consistency and concretely exposing the label-space mismatch regime. AdaMatch unified SSL with domain adaptation to explicitly confront feature distribution shift between labeled and unlabeled data via alignment and adaptive targets. Outside SSL, ImageNet-C pioneered corruption-severity sweeps and area-under-curve summaries to quantify robustness across controlled shift levels. Theoretically, Ben-David et al. derived generalization bounds under domain divergence, isolating source risk and discrepancy terms that guide analysis under distribution mismatch.\nTogether, these works revealed that canonical SSL assumptions\u2014matched distributions and shared label spaces\u2014are routinely violated in practice, yet evaluation and theory lacked a unified treatment for such open environments. Building on the evaluation rigor of Oliver et al. and robustness-curve methodology from ImageNet-C, while drawing settings from OpenMatch and AdaMatch, the current paper synthesizes a Robustness Analysis Curve metric and a divergence-based theoretical framework, and re-implements key SSL baselines (e.g., FixMatch/ReMixMatch) to systematically benchmark and explain SSL robustness as open-environment mismatch varies.",

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a powerful paradigm for leveraging unlabeled data and has been proven to be successful across various tasks. Conventional SSL studies typically assume close environment scenarios where labeled and unlabeled examples are independently sampled from the same distribution. However, real-world tasks often involve open environment scenarios where the data distribution, label space, and feature space could differ between labeled and unlabeled data. This inconsistency introduces robustness challenges for SSL algorithms. In this paper, we first propose several robustness metrics for SSL based on the Robustness Analysis Curve (RAC), secondly, we establish a theoretical framework for studying the generalization performance and robustness of SSL algorithms in open environments, thirdly, we re-implement widely adopted SSL algorithms within a unified SSL toolkit and evaluate their performance on proposed open environment SSL benchmarks, including both image, text, a",
