  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s central contribution\u2014unitary group convolutions with a focus on unitary graph convolutions that provably avoid over-smoothing\u2014stands at the intersection of group-equivariant learning, message passing on graphs, and norm-preserving parameterizations. Cohen and Welling\u2019s group-equivariant convolutions established the algebraic foundation for convolution on general symmetry groups, which this work retains while modifying the operator class to be unitary. On graphs, Gilmer et al.\u2019s MPNN formalism and the Kipf\u2013Welling GCN layer concretized propagation via normalized adjacency, a contraction that empirically and theoretically leads to representation homogenization with depth. Oono and Suzuki formalized this as exponential expressivity loss under repeated application of contracting propagation, directly motivating the need for a propagation operator whose spectrum does not shrink signals.\n\nPrior attempts to go deeper, such as APPNP\u2019s personalized PageRank propagation and GCNII\u2019s initial residual plus identity mapping, mitigate over-smoothing through decoupling, teleportation, and architectural shortcuts. In contrast, the present paper addresses the root cause by enforcing unitary propagation, ensuring spectral modulus one so that repeated layers neither contract nor explode\u2014thereby maintaining distinguishability of node states while enabling long-range dependency modeling. This design is inspired by successes of unitary/orthogonal parameterizations in sequence models (e.g., Unitary RNNs), where norm preservation stabilizes gradient flow. By marrying group convolutional structure with unitary operators, the paper delivers a theoretically grounded and practically effective route to deep, stable, equivariant learning on graphs and broader groups.",
