  "synthesis_narrative": "The core of Xu and Wang (ICML 2024) builds squarely on the dynamic pricing paradigm of Kleinberg and Leighton, adopting the purchase/no-purchase bandit formulation and regret lens. Within this framework, the closest antecedent in modeling is Cohen\u2013Lobel\u2013Paes Leme\u2019s feature-based dynamic pricing, where price enters linearly; Xu and Wang generalize this by letting price elasticity itself depend on context, and they show this is equivalent to a valuation model with heteroscedastic noise. That conceptual link rests on the generalized linear bandit foundation of Filippi et al., which ties linear predictors to binary responses; the present paper departs by handling heteroscedasticity induced by contextual elasticity rather than a fixed, homoscedastic link. Algorithmically, their Pricing with Perturbation (PwP) operationalizes the classic perturb-then-optimize idea of Kalai and Vempala, adapting perturbation as an efficient exploration mechanism tailored to pricing. The regret analysis leverages the self-normalized concentration tools from Abbasi-Yadkori\u2013Pal\u2013Szepesv\u00e1ri, enabling O(\u221a(dT log T)) guarantees even under adversarially chosen contexts. Relative to the prominent high-dimensional contextual pricing baseline of Javanmard and Nazerzadeh, which learns under homoscedastic/GLM-type assumptions, the new model and algorithm handle heteroscedastic valuations and deliver optimal (up to logarithms) rates. Finally, the matching \u03a9(\u221a(dT)) lower bound is informed by dimension-sensitive linear bandit lower bounds originating with Dani\u2013Hayes\u2013Kakade, completing a direct lineage from foundational pricing and bandit theory to a contextually elastic, perturbation-driven solution.",
