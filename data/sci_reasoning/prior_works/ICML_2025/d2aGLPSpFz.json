  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014a controlled real-world benchmark and synthetic ablation that sanity-check causal representation learning\u2014emerges directly from the foundations and gaps established in prior work. Sch\u00f6lkopf et al. (2021) crystallized the CRL agenda and its central assumptions (independent mechanisms, interventions, and identifiable latent factors), which this paper operationalizes in a physical optical setup explicitly designed to satisfy them. The identifiable-representation lineage from Hyv\u00e4rinen and Morioka\u2019s nonlinear ICA/TCL and Khemakhem et al.\u2019s iVAE provides the concrete methodological targets: algorithms that claim identifiability under auxiliary variables and specific mixing-function structures. Suter et al. (2019) argued that interventional robustness is the right validation lens; this work takes that cue but moves beyond synthetic demos by building a ground-truth real system and testing whether claimed conditions actually hold. In parallel, Locatello et al. (2019) exposed reproducibility pitfalls and the fragility of assumptions in disentanglement; the present study extends this critique to CRL by introducing a simpler synthetic ablation of the same system and showing that several methods already fail there, revealing a reproducibility issue upstream of real-world complications. Finally, representative weakly supervised/interventional baselines\u2014Brehmer et al.\u2019s framework and CITRIS\u2014anchor the empirical analysis, making clear that their reliance on specific mixing assumptions is pivotal for performance and often violated in practice.",
