  "synthesis_narrative": "ACE\u2019s core idea\u2014start with an unconstrained, expressive model and progressively enforce equivariance via constrained optimization\u2014sits at the intersection of exact equivariant architectures, soft transformation-consistency regularization, and continuation-based optimization. Group Equivariant CNNs established the modern blueprint for strict architectural equivariance, clarifying the target property and its benefits but also the rigidity that can hinder fitting real, symmetry-imperfect data. Equivariance Through Parameter-Sharing crystallized equivariance as explicit linear constraints on parameters, a perspective ACE directly operationalizes by treating equivariance as constraints that can be measured and enforced during training. Tangent Propagation and, more recently, Augerino demonstrated that transformation behaviors can be encouraged with soft penalties and annealed consistency objectives; ACE generalizes this idea from invariance to full equivariance and elevates it from heuristic regularization to principled constraint handling. Practically, ACE draws on established recipes for training deep models under constraints as in Constrained CNNs and adaptive Lagrangian schemes from the fairness literature, enabling stable optimization with dynamically tuned multipliers that avoid over-constraining early. Finally, ACE\u2019s gradual tightening is guided by homotopy/continuation principles (as in Numerical Continuation Methods), tracing a solution path from flexible to (approximately) equivariant models. Together, these works directly inform ACE\u2019s key contribution: an adaptive, homotopy-driven constrained optimization framework that reconciles expressivity with symmetry by learning to satisfy equivariance progressively.",
