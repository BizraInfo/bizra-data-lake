  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation is to show that the 2022 Lee\u2013Valiant one-dimensional estimator\u2014which already achieves optimal constant-factor sub-Gaussian performance in the standard i.i.d. finite-variance setting\u2014can also be recommended as an all-purpose mean estimator: it retains those optimal constants while gaining formal robustness to outliers and strong performance under heavy-tailed, low-moment regimes. This synthesis is enabled by two intellectual threads.\nFirst, the sub-Gaussian mean estimation literature (Catoni 2012; Devroye\u2013Lerasle\u2013Lugosi\u2013Oliveira 2016; Lugosi\u2013Mendelson 2019) established that one can achieve variance-only, sub-Gaussian deviation bounds without strong tail assumptions, typically via M-estimation or median-of-means style procedures. These works provide both the performance targets and technical tools against which constant-optimality and heavy-tail behavior are benchmarked. Minsker\u2019s geometric median-of-means further offers a canonical robust aggregation mechanism whose guarantees the new work aims to match or surpass without losing efficiency in the i.i.d. regime.\nSecond, the robustness framework from robust statistics (Huber 1964) and its modern algorithmic instantiations (Diakonikolas et al. 2016) formalize adversarial contamination and the desired breakdown properties and tradeoffs. By situating the Lee\u2013Valiant estimator within these frameworks, the paper proves it satisfies contamination-robust guarantees comparable to dedicated robust estimators while preserving its uniquely optimal constants in the uncontaminated case. Together, these prior works directly shape the dual goals\u2014optimal i.i.d. performance and robustness\u2014that the paper unifies in a single, practical estimator.",
