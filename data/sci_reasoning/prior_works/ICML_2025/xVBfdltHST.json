  "synthesis_narrative": "RILOOD\u2019s core idea\u2014learning environment-invariant relational patterns in molecular graphs while capturing context beyond fixed scaffolds\u2014emerges from three converging lines of work. First, IRM crystallized the principle of seeking predictors whose mechanisms are stable across environments; RILOOD instantiates this on graphs by enforcing invariance at both subgraph and whole-graph levels. Second, domain generalization via synthetic environments motivated RILOOD\u2019s mixup-based conditional module: building on mixup\u2019s interpolation of examples, RILOOD explicitly mixes environment-conditioned molecular graphs to expose and stabilize causal structure. Third, representing molecules at multiple structural resolutions drew inspiration from hierarchical graph learning (DiffPool), but RILOOD repurposes hierarchy for a new goal\u2014multi\u2011granularity refinement of context-aware substructures under an invariance objective.\nOn the application side, MoleculeNet formalized molecular property prediction and scaffold-based OOD evaluation (e.g., FreeSolv), defining the robustness target RILOOD aims to improve. Strong IID baselines such as Chemprop/D\u2011MPNN demonstrated high accuracy yet are vulnerable under scaffold shifts, revealing the need for relationally grounded OOD solutions. GroupDRO offered a canonical OOD baseline by optimizing worst-case risk across groups, but it does not identify invariant graph mechanisms, a gap RILOOD explicitly fills. Finally, the medicinal chemistry notion of Bemis\u2013Murcko scaffolds clarified why fixed \u201ccore\u201d substructures are insufficient: critical interactions depend on broader context. RILOOD\u2019s multi\u2011granularity refinement is designed precisely to move beyond cores, capturing stable, context-dependent relations that generalize to unseen solvents and scaffolds.",
