  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key insight is a structural reduction: linearly q^\u03c0-realizable MDPs differ from linear MDPs only at states where all actions are near-indistinguishable in value; by committing to any fixed policy at such states (i.e., learning what to ignore), the remaining problem is a bona fide linear MDP. This connects directly to the linear-MDP framework and algorithms of Jin, Yang, and Wang (2020), whose LSVI-UCB methodology becomes applicable after the reduction, thereby explaining why online RL under q^\u03c0-realizability can attain linear-MDP-level regret. The reduction is motivated by the broader structural-program in general-function-approximation RL initiated by Jiang et al. (2017) and extended by Sun et al. (2019), which emphasize that tractability hinges on problem-specific structure (e.g., Bellman completeness/rank, witness rank). Foster et al. (2021) sharpen this landscape, highlighting when realizability is sufficient for sample-efficient learning and motivating the search for structural transformations\u2014like the paper\u2019s state-skipping\u2014that place a problem within a tractable class. The algorithmic and analytical approach further builds on optimism and confidence-set machinery from Azar et al. (2017), which, combined with linear-MDP tools and their refinements (e.g., Zanette and collaborators), yields regret guarantees matching those known for linear MDPs. In sum, this work synthesizes structural insights from general-function-approximation theory with linear-MDP algorithmics, showing that a carefully learned decomposition into informative versus ignorable states collapses q^\u03c0-realizable RL to the well-understood linear-MDP regime.",
