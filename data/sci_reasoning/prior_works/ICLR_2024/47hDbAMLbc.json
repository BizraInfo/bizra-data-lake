  "synthesis_narrative": "Yu, Gao, and Zhang previously provided an explicit two-layer ReLU design with O(Nn) parameters that exactly interpolates any finite dataset, establishing constructive, size-optimal memorization without robustness guarantees. Lu et al. showed that width governs expressivity and identified fundamental minimal-width thresholds (on the order of the input dimension), while Hanin and Sellke refined minimal-width constraints and topological limitations for ReLU networks; together these width results delineate hard limits any construction must respect. Bartlett, Foster, and Telgarsky connected margins to Lipschitz/spectral control, formalizing how Lipschitz constants certify stability around data and paving the way to tie robust radii to geometric separation. Blum and Rivest\u2019s NP-completeness proof for training small neural networks offers a reduction template demonstrating intrinsic computational intractability of certain training targets. Cohen, Rosenfeld, and Kolter\u2019s randomized smoothing crystallized the notion of certified radii, highlighting certification goals but through stochastic means rather than exact worst-case constructions.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the synthesis was natural: explicit, size-optimal memorization constructions could, in principle, be upgraded to guarantee robustness if their Lipschitz properties were controlled relative to the dataset\u2019s separation. The width limitations clarified what architectures could possibly achieve such guarantees, and classic NP-hardness templates suggested the right reductions to capture the computational barrier of robust memorization. The result is a constructive, parameter-efficient ReLU architecture that achieves robustness up to half the separation bound, alongside matching width lower bounds and NP-hardness results, closing the gap between memorization expressivity and certified robustness.",

    "abstract": "Memorization with neural networks is to study the expressive power of neural networks to interpolate a finite classification data set, which is closely related to the generalizability of deep learning. However, the important problem of robust memorization has not been thoroughly studied. In this paper, several basic problems about robust memorization are solved. First, we prove that it is NP-hard to compute neural networks with certain simple structures, which are robust memorization. A network hypothesis space is called optimal robust memorization for a data set if it can achieve robust memorization for any budget less than half the separation bound of the data set. Second, we explicitly construct neural networks with O(N n) parameters for optimal robust memorization of any data set with dimension n and size N . We also give a lower bound for the width of networks to achieve optimal robust memorization. Finally, we explicitly construct neural networks with\nO(N n log n) parameters for ",
