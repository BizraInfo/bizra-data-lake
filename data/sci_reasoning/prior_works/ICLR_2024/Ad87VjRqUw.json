  "synthesis_narrative": "DeepSDF formalized signed distance fields as continuous, learnable shape representations whose isosurfaces yield clean geometry, while Occupancy Networks popularized function-space modeling for 3D reconstruction and unconditional shape generation; both, however, intrinsically favored watertight surfaces. AtlasNet showed that complex shapes can be parameterized via learnable surface manifolds (atlases), demonstrating that mapping from low-dimensional, surface-aligned coordinates to 3D geometry can flexibly realize open structures. In contrast, Neural Unsigned Distance Fields established that unsigned distances capture thin and open surfaces from image/point inputs, but their volumetric formulations and extraction procedures complicate material-aware mesh rendering and unconditional generative modeling. GET3D advanced generative modeling of textured, physically renderable meshes at high quality, yet its outputs remain watertight and thus struggle with thin, open geometries. PolyGen provided a route to non-watertight meshes through autoregressive polygon generation, but lacked the geometric regularity and rendering-friendly structure afforded by field-based representations anchored to surfaces.\nTaken together, these works revealed a clear opportunity: retain the renderability and generative strengths of mesh- and field-based methods while breaking the watertight constraint to express open surfaces. The natural synthesis is to transplant the SDF concept onto a learned watertight manifold, borrowing AtlasNet\u2019s surface-parameterization insight and UDF\u2019s open-surface capability, and to integrate it into a mesh-compatible pipeline as exemplified by GET3D\u2019s material-aware rendering. This manifold SDF yields open-surface \u201cislands\u201d anchored to a shell, unifying expressive geometry with fast, differentiable rendering and enabling unconditional generative modeling of general 3D shapes.",

    "abstract": "The creation of photorealistic virtual worlds requires the accurate modeling of 3D surface geometry for a wide range of objects. For this, meshes are appealing since they enable 1) fast physics-based rendering with realistic material and lighting, 2) physical simulation, and 3) are memory-efficient for modern graphics pipelines. Recent work on reconstructing and statistically modeling 3D shape, however, has critiqued meshes as being topologically inflexible. To capture a wide range of object shapes, any 3D representation must be able to model solid, watertight, shapes as well as thin, open, surfaces. Recent work has focused on the former, and methods for reconstructing open surfaces do not support fast reconstruction with material and lighting or unconditional generative modelling. Inspired by the observation that open surfaces can be seen as islands floating on watertight surfaces, we parametrize open surfaces by defining a manifold signed distance field on watertight templates.
