  "synthesis_narrative": "OmniSync\u2019s core advances synthesize three threads of prior art: (1) audio-visual lip-sync supervision and the pitfalls of mask-based inpainting, (2) mask-free, structure-preserving diffusion editing, and (3) scalable transformer diffusion with flow-based trajectories. Wav2Lip and SyncNet established the modern lip-sync pipeline\u2014leveraging audio\u2013visual alignment losses and discriminators\u2014while exposing limitations of mouth-region masking and leakage from reference frames. AD-NeRF demonstrated that strong identity and pose consistency are achievable in audio-driven faces, motivating OmniSync\u2019s explicit focus on robustness across poses, occlusions, and stylized content.\n\nConcurrently, diffusion editing evolved from mask-dependent inpainting to mask-free, attention-guided control. Prompt-to-Prompt showed that cross-attention can preserve spatial structure without explicit masks, and Tune-A-Video extended such ideas to temporally coherent video, informing OmniSync\u2019s decision to perform direct per-frame diffusion editing while maintaining long-range consistency\u2014key to its unlimited-duration inference.\n\nAt the architectural and algorithmic level, DiT provides the attention-centric diffusion backbone OmniSync employs for high-capacity, high-fidelity frame generation. Finally, Flow Matching offers principled trajectory design; OmniSync adapts this with a progressive noise initialization that steers sampling toward identity- and pose-preserving flows under weak audio conditioning. Together, these works directly shape OmniSync\u2019s mask-free training paradigm, Diffusion Transformer formulation, and flow-matched inference strategy, yielding universal, robust lip synchronization across diverse visual scenarios.",
