  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of Delayed Feedback in Kernel Bandits is to reconcile kernelized (Gaussian process/RKHS) bandit optimization with stochastic delays, attaining a regret of order ~O(\u221a(\u0393k(T)T) + E[\u03c4]). This builds squarely on the GP-bandit foundations of Srinivas et al., who introduced the information-gain framework (\u0393k(T)) and GP-UCB analysis that underpins essentially all modern kernel bandit regret bounds. Chowdhury and Gopalan sharpened this line with IGP-UCB/GP-TS, providing RKHS concentration tools and algorithmic baselines that the present work adapts to the case where observations arrive late, ensuring confidence sets and acquisition rules remain valid with pending feedback. On the delay side, Joulani et al. established a general reduction for delayed feedback that yields additive delay penalties; their insight directly motivates and structurally enables the additive E[\u03c4] term in the new regret bound. Prior attempts to handle delayed or batched feedback within GP bandits, notably Desautels et al.\u2019s GP-BUCB, paid a multiplicative price in the batch size; this paper targets that precise gap, replacing batch-dependent regret with an additive dependence on the (stochastic) delay. Methodologically, early delayed-bandit ideas from Neu et al. on maintaining optimism under pending losses inform how to act with incomplete observations. Finally, practical batch/asynchronous BO methods such as Gonz\u00e1lez et al. highlight real-world delayed evaluation scenarios; the present work provides the missing, delay-sensitive theoretical guarantees in the kernel setting.",
