  "synthesis_narrative": "Score distillation sampling (SDS) from DreamFusion established the now-standard formulation of optimizing a 3D representation by backpropagating through a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, but its stochastic use of random timesteps yields high-variance gradients and slow convergence. Independently, score-based generative modeling introduced the probability flow ODE, providing a deterministic trajectory that shares marginals with the reverse-time SDE and enabling controlled transport on the data manifold. DDIM operationalized this idea into a practical deterministic sampler with fixed timestep schedules that generates high-quality images in far fewer steps. SDEdit further showed that diffusion sampling with a prescribed schedule can act as an image-to-image translator: injecting noise and then denoising can steer an input toward a target while preserving structure. In parallel, Magic3D demonstrated that a coarse-to-fine pipeline\u2014optimizing at low resolution before high-resolution refinement\u2014substantially boosts fidelity and efficiency for text-to-3D. Finally, ProlificDreamer diagnosed SDS pathologies (instability, mode collapse) and proposed VSD, underscoring the need for variance reduction but at the cost of learning a 3D prior.\nThese threads suggest replacing random-timestep score matching with deterministic probability-flow\u2013aligned sampling and using diffusion as a multi-view image-to-image translator during 3D optimization. Building on the coarse-to-fine blueprint, DreamFlow synthesizes these insights: it approximates the probability flow with a predetermined schedule to provide low-variance, stepwise multi-view updates and embeds this into a three-stage pipeline that scales efficiently to high resolution, achieving faster, higher-quality text-to-3D generation without training new diffusion priors.",

    "abstract": "Recent progress in text-to-3D generation has been achieved through the utilization of score distillation methods: they make use of the pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models by distilling via the diffusion model training objective. However, such an approach inevitably results in the use of random timesteps at each update, which increases the variance of the gradient and ultimately prolongs the optimization process. In this paper, we propose to enhance the text-to-3D optimization by leveraging the T2I diffusion prior in the generative sampling process with a predetermined timestep schedule. To this end, we interpret text-to-3D optimization as a multi-view image-to-image translation problem, and propose a solution by approximating the probability flow. By leveraging the proposed novel optimization algorithm, we design DreamFlow, a practical three-stage coarse-to-fine text-to-3D optimization framework that enables fast generation of high-quality and high-resolution (i.e., 1024\u00d71",
