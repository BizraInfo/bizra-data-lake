  "synthesis_narrative": "Optimal Ablation (OA) sits at the intersection of ablation-based importance, causal interventions, and optimization-driven perturbations. Early transformer analyses demonstrated the utility of internal ablations: Michel et al. and Voita et al. measured attention-head importance by masking or pruning, catalyzing a broad practice of component ablation as an interpretability primitive. However, these methods often rely on ad hoc null baselines (e.g., zero or mean activations), which can induce distribution shift and misestimate importance. In vision, Bau et al.\u2019s Network Dissection established internal interventions as causal probes of units, reinforcing that interpretability requires carefully designed perturbations rather than arbitrary disablement. Fong and Vedaldi\u2019s meaningful perturbations reframed importance as an optimization problem, showing that the right perturbation is the one that best reveals causal impact while controlling collateral changes. Concurrently, causal abstraction and interchange interventions (Geiger et al.) formalized how to evaluate causal roles of internal variables via structured interventions, a perspective that OA embraces. Finally, superposition (Elhage et al.) highlighted why naive ablation can confound multiple features, demanding more principled formulations. OA synthesizes these threads by defining component importance through an optimized ablation that minimizes confounds and distribution shift, yielding theoretical advantages and practical gains. This stronger importance metric, in turn, improves downstream tasks that depend on precise causal localization\u2014such as circuit discovery, factual recall localization (as in ROME-style settings), and latent prediction.",
