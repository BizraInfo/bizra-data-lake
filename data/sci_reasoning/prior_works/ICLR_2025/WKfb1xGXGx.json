  "synthesis_narrative": "Perm\u2019s core contribution\u2014a learned, controllable parametric model that disentangles global hair structure from local curl detail\u2014emerges at the intersection of three intellectual threads. First, the 3D Morphable Model (Blanz and Vetter) established PCA-based parametric shape spaces for human geometry; Perm adapts this principle to hair by representing strands in the frequency domain and learning a compact PCA basis. Second, multiscale frequency decomposition (Burt and Adelson) informs Perm\u2019s explicit split into low- (guide) and high-frequency (residual) components, enabling targeted generative modeling and precise control. Third, production grooming practice, formalized in Yuksel\u2019s Hair Meshes, showed the efficacy of guide-driven global control with interpolated fine structure; Perm emulates this by learning guide textures and residual textures.\nOn the hair reconstruction side, HairNet introduced a scalp-aligned geometry texture parameterization and defined the modern problem setting for single-view hair prediction. Perm leverages that parameterization but addresses a key limitation in many successors\u2014joint modeling of global and local features\u2014by disentangling them in a principled way. Neural Haircut demonstrated the power of a learned prior for task-agnostic reconstruction, yet its coupled modeling limited precise editing. Perm extends that idea, providing a generative prior split across guide and residual spaces. Finally, two-layer deep hair modeling highlighted the benefits of decoupling base shape and details; Perm turns this intuition into a frequency-PCA formulation with separate generative models, yielding stronger control, editability, and performance across tasks.",
