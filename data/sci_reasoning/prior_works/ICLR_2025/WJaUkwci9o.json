  "synthesis_narrative": "Reward Augmented Maximum Likelihood introduced the idea of training sequence models to match a reward-reweighted target distribution, using exponential weighting of sequence quality as a principled alternative to pure MLE. Direct Preference Optimization crystallized this reweighting under a KL prior, showing that the optimal policy is the base model scaled by an exponential of reward, thereby eliminating the need for on-policy RL while preserving the essence of reward-driven distribution shift. Constitutional AI established that language models can act as judges, generating supervisory signals without humans, demonstrating the practical viability of AI feedback. Self-Consistency revealed that generate-and-select at inference\u2014sampling diverse solutions and aggregating by consistency\u2014substantially boosts reasoning, albeit at high computational cost. STaR showed that training on self-verified correct solutions can bootstrap reasoning, embodying a hard-selection version of verifier-guided supervision. Self-Rewarding Language Models extended this by having models produce their own rewards for fine-tuning, offering a scalable self-improvement template. Let\u2019s Verify Step by Step documented that LMs often verify better than they generate, highlighting a systematic asymmetry that can be leveraged. Together these works expose a gap: we can obtain higher-quality outputs via verification and selection, but mostly at inference-time or with ad hoc self-labeling. The sharpening perspective synthesizes RAML/DPO-style exponential reweighting with AI-as-judge verification, amortizing generate-and-select into post-training and yielding a principled, sample-efficient path to shift probability mass toward verified high-quality sequences under clear conditions for when self-improvement is possible.",

It is impossible for this self-improvement to create information that is not already in the model, so why should we expect that this will lead to improved capabilities? We offer a new theoretical perspective on the capabilities of self-improvement through a lens we refer to as \u201csharpening.\u201d Motivated by the observation that language models are often better at verifying response quality than they are at generating correct responses, we formalize self-improvement as using the model itself as a verifier during post-training in order to \u2018sharpen\u2019 the model to one placing large mass on high-quality sequences, thereby amortizing the expensive inference-time computation of generating good sequences.
