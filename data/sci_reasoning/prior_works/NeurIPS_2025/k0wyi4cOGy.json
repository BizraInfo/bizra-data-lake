  "synthesis_narrative": "KARMA\u2019s core innovation\u2014an end-to-end, multi-agent LLM framework that continuously enriches a knowledge graph from unstructured literature while adhering to schema and resolving conflicts\u2014sits at the intersection of three intellectual threads. First, AutoGen and CAMEL provide the architectural and interactional substrate for coordinating multiple role-specialized LLMs. KARMA instantiates this with nine agents that converse, delegate, and critique, enabling reliable division of labor across entity discovery, relation extraction, schema alignment, and conflict resolution.\n\nSecond, the continuous KG construction lineage from NELL, Knowledge Vault, and DeepDive shapes KARMA\u2019s pipeline logic. From NELL it borrows the notion of iterative, lifelong enrichment and belief calibration; from Knowledge Vault it inherits principled fusion and confidence estimation to arbitrate contradictory evidence; and from DeepDive it adapts structured, constraint-aware integration\u2014now executed by LLM agents rather than probabilistic factors\u2014to ensure extracted facts cohere with the target graph.\n\nThird, KARMA operationalizes quality control through LLM-based verification. Building on LLM-as-a-judge, it layers adjudication and cross-checks among agents to boost precision and explicitly reduce conflict edges. Finally, schema conformance is guided by ideas from PARIS, with joint consideration of instance and relation alignment informing how new extractions are mapped into domain-specific ontologies. Together, these threads produce a scalable, self-checking multi-agent system that meaningfully advances automated KG enrichment from scientific text.",
