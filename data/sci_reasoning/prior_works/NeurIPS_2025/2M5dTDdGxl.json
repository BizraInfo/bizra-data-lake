  "synthesis_narrative": "DynaInfer\u2019s core contribution\u2014inferring environment specifications directly from data to enable generalizable learning of dynamical systems\u2014sits at the intersection of environment-based generalization and latent-variable modeling. Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) crystallized the goal of learning predictors stable across environments, while Group DRO and Risk Extrapolation (REx/VREx) operationalized robustness by optimizing worst-case or equalized risk across labeled groups. These methods, however, presuppose access to environment labels. EIIL bridged this gap by proposing to infer environments that expose spurious correlations for invariant learning, establishing that environment discovery can be framed as an optimization objective. DynaInfer extends this thread into the dynamical systems domain and introduces a principled, training-round\u2013wise environment assignment based on prediction errors from fixed neural networks.\nAlgorithmically, DynaInfer\u2019s alternating procedure is rooted in classical EM: it iterates between estimating latent assignments (environments) and updating model parameters, using prediction errors as a surrogate for responsibilities. For time-series structure, Switching Linear Dynamical Systems provide a direct precedent for inferring latent regimes via discrepancies in predictive fit, a perspective DynaInfer updates with modern neural dynamics models and generalization objectives. Mixture-of-experts further informs the use of error-driven gating and alternating training. Synthesizing these lines, DynaInfer offers theoretically grounded alternating optimization without environment labels and empirically demonstrates that prediction-error\u2013based environment inference enables robust, invariant learning across diverse dynamical systems.",
