  "synthesis_narrative": "R2F sits at the intersection of diffusion guidance, compositional conditioning, and LLM planning. Guided Diffusion and Classifier-Free Guidance established that diffusion sampling can be steered at inference by auxiliary signals\u2014either external classifiers or unconditional predictors\u2014laying the foundation for R2F\u2019s training-free intervention during sampling. Latent Diffusion Models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) provided the practical, widely used text-conditioning interface R2F exploits to plug in guidance without retraining base models. On the compositional front, Composable Diffusion showed that combining multiple conditional scores can realize attribute\u2013object conjunctions, a principle R2F adopts and extends by automatically selecting frequent, semantically related helper concepts via an LLM and scheduling their contribution across timesteps to stabilize rare compositions. Attend-and-Excite exposed systematic failures in binding and coverage for multi-concept prompts and offered attention-centric fixes; R2F targets the same failure mode but uses LLM-derived semantic priors rather than attention manipulation, making it complementary. Finally, region/condition-guided frameworks like ControlNet and LLM-based planners like LayoutGPT demonstrate how structural or linguistic plans can improve controllability. R2F builds on these by using the LLM as a semantic planner to surface frequent proxies for rare concepts and orchestrate their temporal exposure during diffusion, yielding a flexible, training-free method that integrates smoothly with regional control while directly boosting rare compositional fidelity.",
