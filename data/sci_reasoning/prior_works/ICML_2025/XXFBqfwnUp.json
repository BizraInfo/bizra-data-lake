  "synthesis_narrative": "STRING\u2019s core innovation\u2014separable, exactly translation-invariant positional encodings for arbitrary-dimensional tokens\u2014emerges from the lineage of relative position modeling and group-theoretic views of attention. Shaw et al. (2018) grounded the field in relative positional encodings, articulating translation invariance within attention. RoFormer (Su et al., 2021) operationalized this idea in 1D via rotary embeddings that encode relative offsets through phase differences. STRING takes RoPE as its direct methodological starting point and extends it to 2D/3D through a unifying theory, preserving exact invariance while enabling separability and learning of frequency parameters.\n\nThe theory behind STRING is anchored by the Fourier perspective on shift invariance (Rahimi & Recht, 2007), which connects translation-invariant functions to characters of the translation group; this yields a principled construction and universality guarantees for the proposed encodings. Inspiration for casting positional encodings through Lie algebras comes from SE(3)-Transformers (Fuchs et al., 2020), which demonstrated how group-structured attention achieves geometric invariances in 3D, motivating STRING\u2019s lightweight, translation-focused analogue.\n\nOn the application side, ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) crystallized the vision tokenization problem where positional cues are essential; STRING serves as a drop-in replacement that yields stronger invariance and performance. Finally, Swin\u2019s learned 2D relative position bias (Liu et al., 2021) highlighted practical shortcomings\u2014lack of exact invariance and scaling costs\u2014that STRING explicitly overcomes, especially salient for efficient 2D/3D robotics tokens.",
