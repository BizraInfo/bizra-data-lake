  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation in \u201cTackling Biased Evaluators in Dueling Bandits\u201d is an unbiased arm-performance estimator and a bias-sensitive exploration algorithm that operate when evaluator bias is known, with regret analysis quantifying how bias that aligns with or opposes ground truth can actually reduce regret. This advances the foundational dueling bandits framework of Yue et al. (2012), which defined the pairwise-feedback setting and regret notion that the new work retains. The algorithmic backbone clearly extends UCB-style methods typified by RUCB (Zoghi et al., 2014) and subsequent Copeland-oriented approaches (Zoghi et al., 2015), but removes their core limitation: the assumption of unbiased feedback. The estimator itself draws direct methodological inspiration from counterfactual debiasing in learning-to-rank (Joachims et al., 2017), translating inverse-propensity correction to the dueling-feedback context using evaluator-specific bias parameters to construct unbiased estimates of arm quality. Conceptually, the paper is also informed by the corrupt bandits literature (Lykouris et al., 2018), which shows how feedback corruption shapes regret; here, a parallel insight is established for systematic evaluator bias, including the counterintuitive benefit of strongly aligned or opposed bias. Finally, the statistical foundation for correcting known evaluator effects traces back to Dawid\u2013Skene (1979), whose confusion-matrix modeling underpins the idea that, given known bias, one can invert the bias to recover unbiased signals. Together, these works directly shape the problem formulation, identify the key gap (unbiasedness), and provide the estimation and analysis principles that the paper extends to biased dueling feedback.",
