  "synthesis_narrative": "3DGS-Enhancer\u2019s core contribution\u2014using view-consistent 2D diffusion priors to enhance unbounded 3D Gaussian Splatting\u2014sits at the intersection of efficient 3D representations and generative priors. The pipeline relies on 3D Gaussian Splatting (Kerbl et al.) as its fast, differentiable 3D backbone; novel views rendered from this model define the supervision loop that will later improve the Gaussians. Because the target setting is large, unbounded scenes, the approach inherits design choices and problem framing from Mip-NeRF 360, which established robust strategies for 360\u00b0 capture, background handling, and anti-aliased rays.\nDreamFusion provided the seminal blueprint for leveraging powerful 2D diffusion priors to supervise 3D by operating on rendered views; 3DGS-Enhancer adapts this idea from text-to-3D to data-driven novel-view enhancement, using diffusion outputs as guidance for fine-tuning the 3DGS. To make those diffusion completions geometrically reliable, the method draws on pose-conditioned view synthesis with diffusion (Zero-1-to-3), confirming that diffusion models can hallucinate pose-controllable novel views from sparse inputs. It further addresses the thorny multi-view consistency issue by connecting to diffusion synchronization across views (SyncDreamer)\u2014but innovates by reframing view consistency as temporal consistency. This is enabled by Video Diffusion Models, whose temporal-coherence priors are exploited by arranging multi-view renderings as a video so time-consistency enforces cross-view alignment. Finally, the approach operates in latent space and fuses information with a spatio-temporal decoder, leveraging Latent Diffusion Models\u2019 encoder\u2013decoder design to restore and integrate consistent latent features before fine-tuning the 3D Gaussians.",
