  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper interrogates the standard RLHF pipeline\u2014learn a reward model from pairwise preferences and optimize a KL-regularized policy against it\u2014originating with Christiano et al. (2017) and adopted by Ziegler et al. (2019), Stiennon et al. (2020), and Ouyang et al. (2022). These works established the practical objective (typically PPO with a KL penalty) and popularized reward model \u201caccuracy\u201d as the central evaluation metric. Building on the policy gradient foundations of Sutton et al. (2000) and the PPO mechanics of Schulman et al. (2017), the present paper reframes RM quality as an optimization property: when the reward model induces low variance in advantages, the RLHF objective becomes flat, causing slow or stalled progress regardless of the model\u2019s accuracy. This connects directly to classical insights from Greensmith et al. (2004) that gradient signal variance governs learning efficiency. The authors further show that a reward model that teaches one language model effectively may induce low-variance rewards for another, highlighting a model-dependent interaction absent from accuracy-only evaluations. In aggregate, these prior works provided (i) the RLHF pipeline and its accuracy-centric practices, and (ii) the optimization theory linking variance to gradient magnitude. The paper synthesizes these threads to argue that variance\u2014and its dependence on the specific student LM\u2014must be evaluated alongside accuracy to predict whether a reward model will be a good teacher.",
