  "synthesis_narrative": "TreeDSB sits at the intersection of entropic multi-marginal optimal transport (mOT), Schr\u00f6dinger bridges (SB), and score-based diffusion modeling. The theoretical foundation that entropic OT admits a dynamic SB formulation originates from the stochastic-control and large-deviation perspectives of Mikami\u2013Thieullen and L\u00e9onard, which justify casting regularized transport as a controlled diffusion with marginal constraints. On the computational OT side, Cuturi and Doucet introduced efficient entropic barycenters via Sinkhorn, and Benamou\u2013Carlier\u2013Cuturi\u2013Nenna\u2013Peyr\u00e9 generalized this to multi-marginal problems through iterative Bregman projections (generalized Sinkhorn), with structure that naturally accommodates tree factorizations; the star-shaped case corresponds to Wasserstein barycenters. Diffusion Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge (De Bortoli et al.) then brought these ideas to continuous-time dynamics with learned score functions, enabling high-dimensional applications by alternating forward/backward diffusions and marginal projections. Song et al.\u2019s score-SDE framework provides the practical machinery to learn time-reversed drifts required by DSB-style algorithms.\n\nTreeDSB\u2019s key contribution is to merge these threads: it extends DSB from two marginals to a tree of marginals, designing a message-passing, alternating-projection procedure over edges that is the dynamic continuous-state analogue of generalized Sinkhorn on trees. This yields a principled and scalable method for multi-marginal entropic OT, with Wasserstein barycenters emerging as the star-tree special case. The result is a high-dimensional, diffusion-based algorithm that inherits both the theoretical guarantees of SB/entropic OT equivalence and the computational efficiency of Sinkhorn-style factorizations.",
