  "synthesis_narrative": "PLMTrajRec\u2019s key contribution\u2014scalable, generalizable recovery of missing GPS points via pre-trained language models\u2014sits at the intersection of sequence reconstruction, road-constrained path inference, and traffic context modeling. At its foundation, BERT established masked-language pretraining and transfer learning, demonstrating that large PLMs fine-tuned on small domain datasets can achieve strong performance; BERT4Rec translated this to sequential reconstruction by masking items and predicting them bidirectionally, directly mirroring trajectory point completion. Decision Transformer further legitimized treating trajectories as sequences suitable for Transformer-based generative modeling, reinforcing the architectural choice of a PLM backbone for mobility data.\n\nOn the domain side, Newson and Krumm\u2019s HMM map matching and the ST-Matching algorithm provide principled mechanisms to respect road-network constraints and handle sparse observations, which PLMTrajRec leverages to ensure recovered points lie on feasible paths and remain robust across varying sampling intervals. To enrich inference with real-world context, STGCN demonstrated how traffic states can be extracted and propagated over road graphs, guiding PLMTrajRec\u2019s incorporation of road condition signals for improved fidelity at missing segments. Finally, CSDI\u2019s conditional imputation under arbitrary missingness informs PLMTrajRec\u2019s strategy to handle heterogeneous gaps and diverse sparsity patterns. Together, these works supply the methodological scaffolding\u2014masked sequence reconstruction, trajectory-as-sequence modeling, road-constrained inference, and traffic-aware context\u2014that PLMTrajRec unifies within a scalable PLM-driven framework.",
