  "synthesis_narrative": "This NeurIPS 2023 paper formalizes why and when local Bayesian optimization works by integrating three strands of prior work. First, TuRBO crystallized the empirical success of local trust-region strategies for high-dimensional black-box optimization, motivating a theoretical account of their behavior. Second, foundational BO theory under GP priors\u2014exemplified by GP-UCB\u2019s regret bounds and convergence analyses for Expected Improvement (Bull; Vazquez & Bect)\u2014provides the analytical toolkit and comparison points for rate guarantees. The authors adapt ideas from these global analyses to the distinct, localized sampling dynamics of trust-region\u2013style procedures. Third, results from the geometry of Gaussian random fields (Adler & Taylor; Cheng & Schwartzman) describe the prevalence and quality of local extrema in smooth GP sample paths. These insights support the paper\u2019s empirical and theoretical claim that individual local optima tend to be strong\u2014helping explain why local search can mitigate the curse of dimensionality in practice. The focal algorithmic antecedent is the local BO method proposed by M\u00fcller et al. (2021), for which the present work delivers the first rigorous convergence rates in both noisy and noiseless settings. By bridging empirical local-BO practice (TuRBO), global BO convergence theory (GP-UCB/EI), and random-field extremal statistics, the paper establishes a principled understanding of local BO\u2019s behavior and provides concrete guarantees for a representative local algorithm.",
