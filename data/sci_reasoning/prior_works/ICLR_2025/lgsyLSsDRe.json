  "synthesis_narrative": "Pooling by Multihead Attention (PMA) in the Set Transformer introduced a learned seed vector that attends to a set to produce a robust, permutation-invariant summary, offering a principled alternative to naive mean or special-token pooling. Perceiver further generalized the idea of using a compact latent array that cross-attends to inputs to form condensed representations, highlighting the effectiveness of learned latent queries for summarization. CLIP operationalized contrastive training at scale with a decoder-style text transformer that represents text via the final EOS token under a contrastive objective, establishing EOS/last-token pooling as the default for decoder-based encoders. SimCSE showed that contrastive learning with large in-batch negatives yields strong, general-purpose sentence embeddings, providing an effective recipe for representation learning. UniLM demonstrated that simply changing attention masks can toggle a transformer between uni- and bi-directional modes, revealing that bidirectional attention is beneficial for understanding-oriented representations. E5 unified retrieval tasks through instruction-formatted query/document prompts and weakly supervised contrastive pretraining, popularizing instruction-driven, multi-stage training for generalist embeddings. Together these works reveal that while contrastive objectives and instruction-driven formulations are powerful, EOS/mean pooling for decoder-only models remains suboptimal and causal masks constrain representation quality. The natural next step is to replace heuristic pooling with a learned latent attention head and to remove causal masking when learning embeddings, while adopting a two-stage, instruction-based contrastive regimen with strong in-batch negatives. NV-Embed synthesizes these insights to turn decoder-only LLMs into high-quality, generalist embedding models that outperform prior EOS/mean pooling baselines.",

In this work, we introduce the NV-Embed model, incorporating architectural designs, training procedures, and curated datasets to significantly enhance the performance of LLM as a versatile embedding model, while maintaining its simplicity and reproducibility.For model architecture, we propose a latent attention layer to obtain pooled embeddings, which consistently improves retrieval and downstream task accuracy compared to mean pooling or using the last <EOS> token embedding from LLMs. To enhance representation learning, we remove the causal attention mask of LLMs during contrastive training. For training algorithm, we introduce a two-stage contrastive instruction-tuning method. It first applies contrastive training with instructions on retrieval datasets, utilizing in-batch negative",
