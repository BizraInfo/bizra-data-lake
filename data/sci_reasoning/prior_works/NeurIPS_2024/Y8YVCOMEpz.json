  "synthesis_narrative": "MetaLA targets an optimal linear-time approximation to the softmax attention map by unifying prior linear-complexity approaches and formalizing three necessary conditions: dynamic memory ability, static approximation ability, and least parameter approximation. The core objective is anchored in the canonical softmax mechanism introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017), which sets the ground truth attention map MetaLA seeks to match. Early linear-efficiency attempts, such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2020) and Nystr\u00f6mformer (Xiong et al., 2021), framed attention as a low-rank/static approximation problem, achieving linear complexity but lacking dynamic, online memory. In parallel, kernelized linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) and Performers (Choromanski et al., 2021) recast softmax via feature maps and random features, enabling streaming prefix updates and offering explicit softmax approximation guarantees\u2014yet still trading off stability and parameter efficiency. Separately, state space models like S4 (Gu et al., 2022) and selective SSMs like Mamba (Dao & Gu et al., 2024) advanced linear-time architectures with strong, content-dependent dynamic memory, but without directly approximating the softmax attention map. MetaLA synthesizes these threads: it adopts the linear attention factorization to enable dynamic memory, incorporates a principled static approximation to the softmax kernel to close the gap left by SSMs and low-rank sketches, and enforces parameter minimality to avoid Performer-style overheads. By explicitly satisfying all three conditions that earlier lines only partially met, MetaLA provides a unified and theoretically grounded design for optimal linear attention.",
