  "synthesis_narrative": "FlexOLMo\u2019s core innovation\u2014independently training experts on private datasets and integrating them later via nonparametric routing for data-flexible inference\u2014sits at the intersection of sparse conditional computation, privacy-preserving training, and post-hoc model composition. The sparsely-gated MoE framework of Shazeer et al. established expert specialization and token routing, while GShard and Switch Transformers demonstrated how to scale and efficiently route among experts in large systems. FlexOLMo adopts this conditional computation scaffolding but departs crucially from prior MoE practice by eliminating joint training across datasets and by replacing learned routers with a nonparametric mechanism bound to data, enabling experts to be plugged in or removed at inference.\n\nFrom the privacy side, FedAvg provided the central principle that performant models can be trained without centralizing sensitive data. FlexOLMo embraces this ethos but eschews parameter aggregation, instead preserving expert modularity to respect data boundaries and enable selective use. Methodologically, AdapterFusion and Model Soups showed that independently trained components can be composed post hoc without access to original training data; FlexOLMo extends this late-binding philosophy to expert-level modules and operationalizes composition through routing rather than weight merging. Finally, kNN-LM motivates FlexOLMo\u2019s nonparametric, data-flexible inference: by decoupling parametric model weights from an external, swappable data index, it becomes possible to control what information influences predictions at run time. Synthesizing these strands, FlexOLMo delivers a MoE-based, privacy-aware framework where experts trained in isolation can be composed on demand, enabling distributed training without data sharing and fine-grained, data-governed inference.",
