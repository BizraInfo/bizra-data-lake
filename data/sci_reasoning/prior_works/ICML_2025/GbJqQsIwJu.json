  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core idea\u2014using pairwise preferences to improve statistical efficiency in estimating continuous parametric distributions\u2014rests on three intertwined threads. First, classical preference models (Bradley\u2013Terry) provided a probabilistic likelihood for pairwise comparisons, giving a direct route to M-estimators from ordinal feedback. Huber\u2019s M-estimation theory then supplies the asymptotic framework the authors use to rigorously compare preference-based and sample-only estimators, enabling their variance dominance results. Building on the econometric tradition of learning from choices, Manski\u2019s maximum score estimator and Han\u2019s maximum rank correlation estimator demonstrated that parameters can be identified and consistently estimated from pairwise orderings alone, a conceptual precursor to constructing preference-based estimators in the present setting. \nSecond, insights from learning with relative feedback\u2014exemplified by Yue and Joachims\u2019 dueling-bandit formulation\u2014suggest that comparisons can be statistically more informative than absolute signals. The authors formalize this intuition in a parametric estimation context, proving strictly smaller asymptotic variance and, under deterministic preferences, exploiting hard constraints to achieve an O(1/n) rate. \nFinally, the practical success of preference feedback for aligning modern models (Christiano et al.) highlighted a gap in statistical understanding; this work closes it by specifying when preferences improve efficiency and by proving matching minimax lower bounds. For these lower bounds, the authors rely on the information-theoretic machinery synthesized by Bin Yu, aligning their accelerated rates with fundamental limits.",
