  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014proving hardness-of-approximation results for tractable probabilistic models\u2014rests on the circuit-based view of probabilistic inference and expressivity inaugurated by arithmetic circuits and sum\u2013product networks. Darwiche\u2019s differential inference work established that tractable inference is enabled by circuit structure and that computation scales with circuit size, directly motivating a size-centered analysis under approximation. The Knowledge Compilation Map further distilled the key structural properties\u2014decomposability, determinism, and smoothness\u2014and connected them to succinctness, providing the lens through which many TPM families are defined and compared.\n\nBuilding on this foundation, the SPN line of work (Poon & Domingos; Delalleau & Bengio; Martens & Medabalimi) supplied concrete circuit classes and hard functions used to derive size separations and lower bounds under exact representation. Delalleau & Bengio\u2019s depth separations and Martens & Medabalimi\u2019s lower-bound techniques suggest how structural constraints induce exponential size blowups\u2014insights that this paper transports to the approximate setting, showing that permitting nonzero error in standard statistical distances does not always eliminate these blowups. Finally, the unifying probabilistic circuits framework by Choi, Vergari, and Van den Broeck, together with structured decomposability from SDDs, gives the taxonomy and structural regimes across which the new results are formulated. Together, these works directly shape the paper\u2019s methodology and statements: they define the model families, the structural constraints enabling tractability, and the proof strategies for establishing that even approximating certain distributions requires large circuits.",
