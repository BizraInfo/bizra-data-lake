  "synthesis_narrative": "Olsson et al. isolated the induction-head mechanism as a concrete bigram-like circuit for next-token prediction, establishing that specific attention patterns implement algorithmic behavior within transformers. Elhage et al. provided the broader transformer-circuits framework, crystallizing how to decompose models into interpretable algorithmic components whose functions can be measured. Lampinen et al. showed that data distribution can push transformers toward majority-label heuristics or toward rule-based inference, indicating a real tradeoff between simple frequency-driven behavior and structured computation in ICL. Xie et al. argued that ICL can implement Bayesian inference, situating in-context behavior as estimation of underlying generative parameters\u2014ideas naturally aligned with estimating unigram/bigram statistics in sequence data. Power et al. documented grokking\u2014sudden generalization after prolonged memorization\u2014revealing phase-like transitions in training. Nanda et al. connected such transitions to competition among circuits, demonstrating how training dynamics can shift dominance from shortcut to rule-based algorithms. Von Oswald et al. further characterized ICL as gradient descent in synthetic, non-sequential tasks, underscoring the need for a sequence-native, yet tractable, testbed. Together these works exposed a coherent gap and opportunity: a unified, sequence-modeling setting that reproduces known ICL phenomena while enabling circuit-level analysis of algorithmic tradeoffs. The present paper responds by introducing a finite mixture of Markov chains as that setting, defining four concrete algorithms (retrieval vs. inference crossed with unigram vs. bigram) that encompass prior observations like induction and frequency heuristics, and explaining phase transitions through explicit competition dynamics among these circuits\u2014thus synthesizing mechanistic interpretability, Bayesian/inference views, and grokking-style dynamics into one explanatory framework.",

    "abstract": "In-Context Learning (ICL) has significantly expanded the general-purpose nature of large language models, allowing them to adapt to novel tasks using merely the inputted context. This has motivated a series of papers that analyze tractable synthetic domains and postulate precise mechanisms that may underlie ICL. However, the use of relatively distinct setups that often lack a sequence modeling nature to them makes it unclear how general the reported insights from such studies are. Motivated by this, we propose a synthetic sequence modeling task that involves learning to simulate a finite mixture of Markov chains. As we show, models trained on this task reproduce most well-known results on ICL, hence offering a unified setting for studying the concept. Building on this setup, we demonstrate we can explain a model\u2019s behavior by decomposing it into four broad algorithms that combine a fuzzy retrieval vs. inference approach with either unigram or bigram statistics of the context.
