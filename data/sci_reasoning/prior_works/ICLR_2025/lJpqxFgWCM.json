  "synthesis_narrative": "MonST3R\u2019s core leap is to bring the ST3R family\u2019s pointmap representation into the dynamic regime by predicting a pointmap per timestep and training it on limited dynamic, posed video data with depth. The immediate intellectual anchor is DUSt3R, whose pointmap formulation and architecture MonST3R directly inherits and generalizes from static to dynamic scenes. Advances from MASt3R further inform training and initialization choices that strengthen this geometry-first paradigm. The paper positions itself explicitly against the prevailing dynamic-scene pipelines that rely on multi-stage decomposition or heavy global optimization. Neural Scene Flow Fields (NSFF) epitomizes the latter\u2014an effective but per-scene\u2013optimized framework\u2014whose limitations in scalability and simplicity MonST3R seeks to overcome via single forward passes that output per-timestep geometry. OmniMotion offers conceptual inspiration that dynamic 3D can be recovered without explicit depth\u2013flow decomposition; MonST3R embodies this philosophy using the DUSt3R pointmap as the central representation. Because the bottleneck is data\u2014posed dynamic videos with depth\u2014MonST3R\u2019s fine-tuning recipe critically depends on suitable supervision from Scene Flow datasets (e.g., FlyingThings3D) and synthetic/real driving corpora like Virtual KITTI 2 and the Waymo Open Dataset. These resources directly enable the adaptation of a static pointmap model to dynamic scenes, completing the direct lineage from pointmap representation (DUSt3R/MASt3R) to geometry-first dynamic reconstruction.",
