  "synthesis_narrative": "FramePack sits at the intersection of long-context video diffusion and exposure-bias mitigation for autoregressive generation. Video Diffusion Models established denoising over short temporal windows, while Latent Diffusion Models and their video variants such as Stable Video Diffusion popularized latent-space training and recurrent/sliding-window inference. These systems are constrained by fixed context length and suffer from error accumulation over long rollouts. FramePack addresses both by introducing frame-wise importance-driven context packing\u2014conceptually akin to DynamicViT\u2019s importance-based sparsification and Token Merging\u2019s similarity-based consolidation, but applied temporally to compress redundant history and allocate more capacity to salient frames. This enables training with larger batches and inference across thousands of frames within a fixed compute budget.\nOn the robustness side, FramePack tackles observation/exposure bias directly. Its early-established endpoints and adjusted sampling orders extend ideas from masked/bidirectional conditioning in MCVD to explicitly anchor generation and control temporal dependency chains. The discrete history representation echoes VQ-VAE\u2019s stabilizing discrete latents, curbing the compounding of small continuous errors. Together, these lines of work culminate in a next-frame(-section) diffusion framework that preserves long-range temporal coherence, scales context efficiently, and reduces drift\u2014while remaining compatible with and finetunable from prevailing latent video diffusion backbones.",
