  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core advance\u2014an extra-gradient difference step that yields a crucial quasi-cocoercivity property in constrained nonconvex\u2013nonconcave minimax\u2014stands squarely on the extragradient lineage. Korpelevich\u2019s extragradient method introduced the auxiliary-point stabilization and natural handling of constraints via projections, while Nemirovski\u2019s Mirror-Prox formalized cocoercivity-style estimates crucial for rate analysis in variational inequalities. To make these ideas single-loop and more oracle-efficient, the authors draw on Popov\u2019s reflected/single-call extragradient concept and on optimistic gradient methods, where gradient differencing (using current and past gradients) stabilizes adversarial dynamics without a second gradient evaluation. Malitsky and Tam\u2019s forward\u2013reflected\u2013backward method further demonstrated that reflecting/differencing can deliver cocoercivity-like control even when true cocoercivity fails\u2014an insight the present work adapts to establish a quasi-cocoercivity inequality pivotal to its tighter bounds. The algorithm also incorporates momentum on the dual side while preserving feasibility, resonating with Chambolle\u2013Pock\u2019s over-relaxed primal\u2013dual updates in constrained saddle-point settings. Finally, relative to the established complexity frontiers for weakly convex\u2013weakly concave/nonconvex\u2013nonconcave minimax (e.g., Lin\u2013Jin\u2013Jordan\u2019s \u2248\u1ebc(\u03b5^{-4}) bounds under broad settings), the paper leverages its new quasi-cocoercivity-driven analysis to close the gap to O(\u03b5^{-2}) in the constrained NC\u2013NC regime, without imposing additional structural assumptions.",
