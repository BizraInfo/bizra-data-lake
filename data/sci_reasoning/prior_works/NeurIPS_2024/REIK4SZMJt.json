  "synthesis_narrative": "The key contribution of the paper is a quantitative, geometric account of how hippocampal place-cell tuning properties set a tradeoff between spatial resolution and the number of distinct contexts (maps) that can be represented\u2014its contextual capacity. This builds on the foundational discovery that hippocampal neurons encode position (O\u2019Keefe & Dostrovsky) and the observation that their tuning remaps when environments or cues change (Muller & Kubie). Evidence for abrupt, attractor-like switching between representations (Wills et al.) motivates treating contexts as discrete maps whose number can be analyzed as a capacity problem. Theoretical work on storing multiple spatial maps in attractor networks (Battaglia & Treves) provides a direct precedent for formal capacity calculations, which this paper extends by explicitly incorporating empirically grounded place-field statistics and geometric population-code considerations. Empirical determinants of place-field size and layout (O\u2019Keefe & Burgess) and information-theoretic analyses linking tuning to spatial information (Skaggs et al.) supply the critical link between field width/tiling and localization precision used in the tradeoff derivation. Finally, coding-theoretic perspectives from grid-cell models (Sreenivasan & Fiete) establish the conceptual template that precision and representational range are coupled, an idea the present work adapts to hippocampal place codes to show that increasing positional resolution necessarily diminishes the capacity for distinct contextual remappings. Together, these works converge to enable a principled, quantitative theory of how the structure of place fields governs the balance between \u201cplace\u201d precision and \u201cspace\u201d of contexts.",
