  "synthesis_narrative": "CompeteAI\u2019s core innovation\u2014formalizing and empirically analyzing competition among LLM-based agents in a realistic, evolving market\u2014arises from three converging lines of prior work. First, Generative Agents demonstrated that LLMs can sustain long-horizon, memory-rich social simulations in a town, establishing the substrate CompeteAI transforms into a market with explicit rivalrous objectives. Second, social-science\u2013oriented LLM simulation works (Argyle et al.) and economic-agent modeling (Horton) provided the key premise that LLMs can act as economically meaningful agents with heterogeneous preferences and decision rules; CompeteAI operationalizes this by casting customers as demand and restaurants as competing suppliers, letting strategies adapt under competitive pressure. Third, practical multi-agent conversation frameworks (AutoGen) and role-playing setups (CAMEL) supplied the interaction protocol pattern, but largely emphasized cooperation; CompeteAI directly addresses this gap by designing adversarial incentives, market feedback, and longitudinal competition to elicit strategic transformations. Finally, classic economic theory\u2014especially Hotelling\u2019s spatial competition\u2014anchors both the environment\u2019s design (location/positioning and price competition) and the validation of emergent macro-regularities observed in simulation. Complementary evidence from adversarial-behavior studies (MACHIAVELLI) motivates measuring strategic adaptation and unintended behaviors under competition. Together, these works directly enable CompeteAI\u2019s framework and competitive town implementation, while their limitations\u2014a lack of competitive objectives, limited economic structure, and absent micro\u2013macro grounding\u2014are precisely what CompeteAI targets and extends.",
