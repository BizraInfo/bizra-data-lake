  "synthesis_narrative": "Wasserstein barycenters were formalized as minimizers of weighted sums of Wasserstein distances, establishing the geometric notion of an average measure in optimal transport (Agueh and Carlier). To make this tractable, sliced variants compute barycenters by projecting measures onto lines, solving 1D problems, and averaging over projections, yielding an efficient computational baseline (Bonneel et al.). Subsequent advances showed that the slicing mechanism itself shapes behavior: generalized slicing via alternative Radon transforms alters the geometry and quality of sliced OT estimates (Kolouri et al.). Beyond fixed random projections, optimizing projection directions can markedly improve discrimination and sample efficiency, as evidenced by max-sliced Wasserstein distances (Deshpande et al.). Pushing this further, learning a distribution over projections reduces variance and accelerates sliced OT computations (Nguyen et al.), indicating that projection selection is a powerful lever. Parallel work on robustness exposed that heterogeneous marginals can skew barycenters and proposed trimming to mitigate outliers, albeit at the cost of tuning hyperparameters (\u00c1lvarez-Esteban et al.). Together, these strands surfaced a gap: the standard (uniform-weight) sliced barycenter can be inefficient and can yield uneven barycenter-to-marginal distances under heterogeneity. The natural next step is to explicitly target marginal-distance fairness within the sliced framework and to leverage learned slicing distributions for efficiency. The paper synthesizes these insights by casting fairness as a constrained SWB problem and introducing hyperparameter-free surrogate objectives, while adopting slicing distribution selection to achieve practical, efficient computation.",

    "abstract": "The Sliced Wasserstein barycenter (SWB) is a widely acknowledged method for efficiently generalizing the averaging operation within probability measure spaces. However, achieving marginal fairness SWB, ensuring approximately equal distances from the barycenter to marginals, remains unexplored. The uniform weighted SWB is not necessarily the optimal choice to obtain the desired marginal fairness barycenter due to the heterogeneous structure of marginals and the non-optimality of the optimization. As the first attempt to tackle the problem, we define the marginal fairness sliced Wasserstein barycenter (MFSWB) as a constrained SWB problem. Due to the computational disadvantages of the formal definition, we propose two hyperparameter-free and computationally tractable surrogate MFSWB problems that implicitly minimize the distances to marginals and encourage marginal fairness at the same time. To further improve the efficiency, we perform slicing distribution selection and obtain the third ",
