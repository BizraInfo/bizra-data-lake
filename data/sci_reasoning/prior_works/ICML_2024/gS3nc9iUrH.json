  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014representing molecules as random walks over interpretable graph grammars\u2014emerges from two converging lines of work: grammar-constrained molecular generation and sequence-based representations of graphs. On the grammar side, GrammarVAE established the power of formal grammars for validity and smoother optimization in molecular design, and SELFIES further showed that representation-level constraints can guarantee validity and improve data efficiency. Moving beyond strings, JT-VAE introduced a hierarchical, motif-centric decomposition of molecules, laying the groundwork for interpretable and valid generation. Molecular Hypergraph Grammar formalized this perspective with explicit graph/hypergraph grammars, ensuring compositional validity and offering a principled space for optimization.\n\nOn the sequence/trajectory side, node2vec and NetGAN demonstrated that random-walk sequences can compactly capture graph structure for learning and even generative modeling. The present work fuses these ideas: it equips the chemically meaningful, hierarchical design space defined by a graph grammar with a random-walk parameterization. This yields a unified, data-efficient representation that supports both molecule generation and property prediction while preserving interpretability. Moreover, by aligning grammar productions with chemically intuitive motifs, the approach inherits the interpretability and synthesizability benefits historically associated with substructure-based descriptors like ECFPs, but now within a generative, principled grammatical framework. The result is a model that connects validity, interpretability, and efficiency through random-walk trajectories over an explicit molecular design grammar.",
