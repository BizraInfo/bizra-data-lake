  "synthesis_narrative": "ACM-MILP\u2019s core innovation\u2014adapting constraint modifications using a learned latent space while preserving constraint interrelations via community detection\u2014rests on two direct pillars: learned structural representations of MILPs and the centrality of community structure for instance hardness. On the MILP side, Gasse et al. (2019) provided the variable\u2013constraint bipartite graph view and learned embeddings that make it natural to embed constraints and reason about their relationships, a foundation ACM-MILP directly uses for probability-based, latent-space-driven constraint selection. Earlier, Khalil et al. (2016) established the value of exploiting problem structure and features in MILPs for learning-guided decisions, underscoring the inadequacy of structure-agnostic random edits that ACM-MILP replaces.\n\nFrom the instance-generation perspective, Gir\u00e1ldez-Cru and Levy (2016) showed that preserving community structure is crucial to maintaining realism and hardness in generated SAT instances, directly inspiring ACM-MILP\u2019s shift from single-constraint tweaks to community-aware, collective modifications. This is operationalized through community detection on the MILP\u2019s bipartite graph: Barber (2007) provides the bipartite modularity framework and Blondel et al. (2008) the scalable Louvain algorithm, both of which ACM-MILP extends to identify strongly related constraints for grouped edits. Finally, Bengio et al. (2021) articulate the broader gap\u2014data scarcity and distribution shift for ML4CO\u2014providing the motivation for ACM-MILP\u2019s hardness-preserving generation approach that advances beyond random perturbation baselines by explicitly modeling instance structure and interdependencies.",
