  "synthesis_narrative": "Rockmate\u2019s core contribution\u2014automatic, budgeted activation rematerialization that is both fast and near-optimal\u2014stands on a direct lineage of checkpointing and rematerialization research. The conceptual foundation is the trade-off between memory and recomputation introduced by gradient checkpointing (Chen et al., 2016) and the optimal checkpointing principles from reverse-mode automatic differentiation (Griewank & Walther, Revolve). These works establish the problem\u2019s essence: reduce peak activation memory by strategically discarding and recomputing intermediates. Checkmate (Jain et al., 2020) brought these ideas to general DNN computation graphs via ILP optimization, defining the modern problem formulation of optimal rematerialization on arbitrary DAGs but at a prohibitive whole-graph cost. Rotor (Eyraud-Dubois et al., 2022) then delivered a very fast scheduler for strictly sequential models, revealing that near-optimal schedules can be computed quickly when structure is exploitable. Rockmate unifies these strands by automatically detecting a widespread block structure in PyTorch models, then applying a Checkmate-style optimizer within each complex block (addressing Checkmate\u2019s scalability gap) and a Rotor-style sequential scheduler across the block sequence (overcoming Rotor\u2019s generality limitation). Insights from Gruslys et al. (2016) on sequential checkpointing further inform the use of sequential scheduling at the inter-block level. Together, these prior works directly motivate Rockmate\u2019s blockwise\u2013sequential hybrid that achieves Checkmate-like efficiency with Rotor-like speed.",
