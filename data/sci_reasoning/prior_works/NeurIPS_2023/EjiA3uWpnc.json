  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution is an SE(3)-equivariant neural operator that combines a coefficient-learning front-end with a residual operator layer, and reinterprets the resulting architecture as a convolution on graphons (InfGCN). This synthesis rests on three pillars. First, operator learning: Fourier Neural Operator (Li et al., 2021) established residual integral-operator layers parameterized in spectral bases for mappings between function spaces, while DeepONet (Lu et al., 2021) provided a complementary coefficient-learning (branch\u2013trunk) paradigm. The present work fuses these ideas by learning coefficients on continuous inputs and applying a residual operator, but crucially adapts the parameterization to respect SE(3) symmetry. Second, equivariance: the general framework of Group Equivariant CNNs (Cohen & Welling, 2016) motivates designing layers equivariant to group actions; Tensor Field Networks (Thomas et al., 2018) make this concrete for SE(3) via irreducible representations and spherical harmonics; and SE(3)-Transformer (Fuchs et al., 2020), along with practical building blocks codified in e3nn, demonstrate scalable, strictly equivariant interactions. These works directly inform the paper\u2019s equivariant coefficient projections and residual operator construction. Third, graphon perspective: by grounding the residual operator in the integral-operator view of graph limits introduced by Lov\u00e1sz & Szegedy (2006), the model is interpreted as a graphon convolution (InfGCN), bridging discrete graphs and continuous domains. Together, these strands enable a model that captures 3D geometric structure, preserves SE(3) equivariance by design, and leverages both discrete and continuous representations to achieve state-of-the-art performance.",
