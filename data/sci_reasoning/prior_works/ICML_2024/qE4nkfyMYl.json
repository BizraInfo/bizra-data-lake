  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014using a multivariate hypergeometric likelihood to jointly infer unknown total population size and category sizes under severe undersampling\u2014stands on two converging lines of prior work. From classical statistics, Chapman\u2019s 1951 capture\u2013recapture analysis provided the foundational idea that finite-population size can be identified via a (multi)hypergeometric likelihood when sampling occurs without replacement; the present paper generalizes this principle from single-category mark\u2013recapture to multivariate categories and modern ML settings. From modern machine learning, Kingma and Welling\u2019s VAE furnished the variational inference framework needed to operationalize this likelihood with continuous latent variables and amortized inference.\n\nThe empirical and methodological targets are shaped by dominant count-modeling baselines that assume with-replacement sampling. In recommendation and collaborative filtering, Liang et al.\u2019s Mult-VAE (multinomial decoder) and Gopalan et al.\u2019s Poisson factorization serve as primary systems; both treat the population size as fixed/known and cannot recover finite-population effects, motivating the paper\u2019s replacement of their likelihoods with the hypergeometric. Likewise, Lopez et al.\u2019s scVI established negative-binomial decoders for counts in deep generative models; the current work demonstrates that a hypergeometric decoder more faithfully captures finite-population sampling, improving both population-size estimation and latent representations under undersampling. Finally, in NLP, Miao et al. set multinomial decoders as default for bag-of-words VAEs; the new method directly addresses the multinomial\u2019s with-replacement limitation by adopting a hypergeometric likelihood that enables inference of the unknown population size.",
