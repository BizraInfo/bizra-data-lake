  "synthesis_narrative": "This paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014quantifying the randomness complexity required to achieve strong forms of stability, particularly replicability and differential privacy (DP), and proving a weak-to-strong upgrade\u2014builds most immediately on two 2024 threads. Dixon\u2013Pavan\u2013Vander Woude\u2013Vinodchandran (ICML 2024) initiated a direct study of the randomness needed for stability/replicability and introduced amplification-style arguments that convert weak guarantees into stronger ones with additional randomness. In parallel, Cannone\u2013Su\u2013Vadhan (ITCS 2024) analyzed the randomness complexity of DP mechanisms, developing techniques (e.g., limited-independence and extractor-style constructions) and lower-bound frameworks that the present work adapts and unifies across both DP and replicability.\nFoundationally, Bousquet\u2013Elisseeff (2002) formalized algorithmic stability and its connection to generalization, providing the conceptual backbone for asking how much randomness is necessary for stability. Dwork et al. (2015) further cemented the bridge between DP and stability/generalization in adaptive settings, motivating a common treatment of these notions under a shared randomness budget. Within DP, McSherry\u2013Talwar (2007) delineated the inherently randomized nature of private mechanisms via the exponential mechanism, offering concrete algorithmic templates whose seed length can be scrutinized. Finally, Kasiviswanathan et al. (2011) situated DP firmly within learning theory, clarifying the targets and constraints for private learners.\nTogether, these works supply both the conceptual unification (stability \u2194 DP) and the technical machinery (amplification, limited-independence, extractor-inspired analyses) that enable this paper\u2019s weak-to-strong theorem and its tight bounds on the random bits required to realize robust stability guarantees.",
