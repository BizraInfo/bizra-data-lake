  "synthesis_narrative": "ORIGAMISPACE\u2019s core innovation\u2014evaluating MLLMs on multi-step spatial reasoning under strict mathematical constraints using origami\u2014emerges from two converging lines of work: diagnostic visual reasoning benchmarks and geometry-with-diagrams problem solving. CLEVR established the blueprint for controlled, multi-step compositional reasoning, which ORIGAMISPACE repurposes for visuospatial origami, adding structured intermediates like the folding process and compiled flat patterns. From the math-and-diagram side, GeoQA introduced the formulation of solving geometry with explicit visual constraints, while UniGeo showed that representing reasoning as an executable, structured program substantially clarifies and evaluates the reasoning process. ORIGAMISPACE directly extends these ideas by defining a domain-specific CP code and step-by-step folding traces that are executable and verifiable.\nMathVista exposed the current limitations of MLLMs on visually grounded quantitative and geometric problems, explicitly motivating a benchmark that fuses spatial reasoning with hard constraints and demands multi-step consistency. Complementing these, GQA\u2019s focus on precise spatial relations informed ORIGAMISPACE\u2019s Spatial Relationship Prediction task, ensuring that relational understanding is evaluated alongside procedural reasoning. Finally, Tachi\u2019s Freeform Origami provides the geometric and kinematic foundations for representing crease patterns and folding sequences, enabling ORIGAMISPACE to define mathematically grounded supervision targets (compiled flat patterns, folding steps) and a code-generation endpoint. Together, these works directly shaped ORIGAMISPACE\u2019s problem formulation, task design, and representation choices, yielding a benchmark that tests spatial reasoning, mathematical correctness, and end-to-end executable generation in a unified origami domain.",
