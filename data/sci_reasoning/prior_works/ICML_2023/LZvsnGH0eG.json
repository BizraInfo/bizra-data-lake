  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of Kim and Yang is a single Lagrangian/ODE framework and discretization that unifies the two most widely used Nesterov accelerated schemes for convex and strongly convex objectives. This lineage begins with Nesterov\u2019s seminal 1983 method for smooth convex optimization and his 2004 strongly convex variant, which created the very dichotomy the authors seek to dissolve. The modern continuous-time viewpoint of acceleration\u2014crucial for the present unification\u2014comes from Su, Boyd, and Candes, who modeled Nesterov\u2019s method as an ODE but only for convex objectives, and from Wibisono, Wilson, and Jordan, whose Bregman Lagrangian provides a general variational scaffold for deriving accelerated flows. Building on these, the paper directly extends the Lagrangian approach to produce a single, parameterized dynamics that recovers both convex and \u03bc-strongly convex behaviors. Shi, Du, Jordan, and Su\u2019s high-resolution ODEs sharpened the continuous-time modeling but still required separate treatments for the two regimes; this explicit split is a key gap the unified AGM-G ODE closes. Krichene, Bayen, and Bartlett\u2019s connection between continuous-time mirror-descent dynamics and discrete accelerated algorithms informs the authors\u2019 derivation of a simple momentum discretization and its non-Euclidean generalization. Finally, OGM by Kim and Fessler represents the strongest convex-case baseline; the unified AGM preserves optimal O(1/k^2) performance while guaranteeing favorable behavior for ill-conditioned strongly convex problems, thereby bridging and improving upon the prior dichotomy.",
