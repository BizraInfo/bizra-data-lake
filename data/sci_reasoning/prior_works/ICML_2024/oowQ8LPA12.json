  "synthesis_narrative": "Early learned-systems work in databases established both the promise and the fragility of replacing classical structures with models. Kraska et al. framed indexing as learning a cumulative distribution function, showing dramatic speedups yet implicitly tying performance to the stability of data distributions. Ferragina and Vinciguerra advanced this direction with the PGM-index, giving provable error and space\u2013time bounds as a function of the key distribution\u2014evidence that rigorous guarantees are possible when distributional structure is explicit. In parallel, Mitzenmacher\u2019s theory of learned Bloom filters crystallized a key challenge: learned components can outperform classical counterparts on the training distribution but degrade under shift, underscoring the need for formal robustness characterizations.\nLearning-augmented algorithms offered a general methodology for such characterizations: Lykouris and Vassilvitskii analyzed algorithms with ML advice, proving bounded regret relative to classical baselines when predictions are imperfect. Complementing this, Ben-David et al.\u2019s domain adaptation theory provided divergence measures and generalization tools to reason about performance under distribution changes. On the applications side, learned cardinality estimation (e.g., Kipf et al.) showcased significant empirical gains but also sensitivity to drift, highlighting a gap between practice and guarantees.\nBuilding on these threads, the ICML 2024 paper introduces distribution learnability to unify and extend theoretical analyses across indexing, cardinality estimation, and sorting in dynamic datasets. It offers bounds that explain when and why learned methods retain advantages over non-learned alternatives after distribution shifts, translating ideas from learning-augmented algorithms and domain adaptation into database-specific, operation-level guarantees.",
