  "synthesis_narrative": "PhysX-3D\u2019s central contribution\u2014physical-grounded 3D asset generation with standardized annotations across absolute scale, material, affordance, kinematics, and function\u2014sits at the intersection of 3D generative modeling and physics-rich robotics datasets/simulators. On the generation side, DreamFusion established score distillation as a practical path from language to 3D, yet its outputs (like most follow-ups) prioritize geometry and appearance over physical usability. Objaverse catalyzed large-scale 3D training but lacks consistent physics, scale, and affordance labels, exposing an infrastructural gap that PhysX-3D directly targets. On the robotics/physics side, YCB introduced metrically accurate, physically characterized objects, motivating PhysX-3D\u2019s absolute-scale requirement for real-world deployment. PartNet-Mobility standardized kinematic structure (joint types and motion axes) for articulated objects, which maps naturally to PhysX-3D\u2019s kinematics dimension. GAPartNet further linked object parts to manipulation affordances, guiding PhysX-3D\u2019s affordance design that couples geometry with actionable function. Complementing these, SAPIEN showed that physics-centric simulation demands assets with articulated structure and material parameters, while ObjectFolder 2.0 demonstrated the value of multi-sensory, physically meaningful object attributes beyond appearance. Together, these works directly inform PhysX-3D\u2019s dataset schema and its end-to-end paradigm: retain modern 3D generative capacity, but constrain and annotate assets so they are metrically scaled, materially plausible, functionally annotated, and kinematically operable\u2014thereby transforming text/conditioned generation into simulation- and embodiment-ready 3D asset creation.",
