  "synthesis_narrative": "PPL\u2019s contribution emerges at the intersection of interactive imitation learning, preference-based learning, and model-based prediction. DAgger and HG-DAgger established the efficacy of learning from human interventions, but primarily applied corrections only at the current visited state, creating a local, myopic learning signal. PPL reframes that intervention as an implicit preference, thereby connecting to preference-based RL, notably Christiano et al.\u2019s human preference learning and Sadigh et al.\u2019s trajectory-segment preferences. This reframing enables the use of preference optimization machinery without requiring explicit pairwise labels; instead, a human takeover defines a relative judgment about what should happen versus what the agent attempted.\n\nTo project the supervisory signal into states the agent is likely to reach, PPL leverages the model-based insight of learning from predicted futures. Dreamer\u2019s imagined rollouts and MBPO\u2019s short-horizon modeling motivate PPL\u2019s preference horizon: the agent uses forecasts to apply preference optimization over L-step future states, propagating expert intent into safety-critical regions ahead of time. Finally, works like Deep TAMER show how continuous human input can shape policies online; PPL inherits the practicality of in-the-loop supervision but reduces annotation burden by harvesting preferences implicitly from interventions. Together, these strands yield a method that transforms sparse, local interventions into temporally extended, data-efficient preference signals over predicted rollouts, directly addressing the limitations of myopic correction in interactive imitation learning.",
