  "synthesis_narrative": "Score-based generative modeling through SDEs established continuous-time diffusion and probability-flow ODEs, making clear how the score and drift scale with the noise level and revealing the potential for unbounded behavior as the noise vanishes. The original DDPM framework defined the discrete schedules and training objective used broadly in practice, where extremely small timesteps concentrate error and instability. Improved DDPM later introduced SNR-based loss weighting and v-prediction to curb instabilities at very high or low noise, offering practical but heuristic mitigation of edge regimes. Elucidating the Design Space (EDM) systematized design choices, introducing log-SNR parameterization, a Karras timestep schedule, and a lower noise floor \u03c3_min that pragmatically avoids the zero-noise regime. Complementarily, DPM-Solver showed that integrating the ODE in log-SNR time reduces stiffness, providing a concrete time change that improves numerical behavior. Rectified Flow further demonstrated that reparameterizing dynamics to straighten trajectories yields better conditioning with bounded derivatives near endpoints. Together, these works expose that instability accumulates near vanishing noise, that loss weighting and hard cutoffs can alleviate it, and that appropriate time reparameterization improves both conditioning and integration. However, a principled diagnosis of the root singularity in diffusion dynamics remained missing. The present paper closes this gap by proving an infinite Lipschitz phenomenon as t\u21920 and synthesizing the insights from log-SNR parameterization and stiff ODE integration into a time-scaling scheme (E\u2011TSDM) that regularizes the Lipschitz behavior during both training and sampling, surpassing heuristic SNR weighting and \u03c3 cutoffs.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models, which employ stochastic differential equations to sample images through integrals, have emerged as a dominant class of generative models. However, the rationality of the diffusion process itself receives limited attention, leaving the question of whether the problem is well-posed and well-conditioned. In this paper, we uncover a vexing propensity of diffusion models: they frequently exhibit the infinite Lipschitz near the zero point of timesteps. We provide theoretical proofs to illustrate the presence of infinite Lipschitz constants and empirical results to confirm it. The Lipschitz singularities pose a threat to the stability and accuracy during both the training and inference processes of diffusion models. Therefore, the mitigation of Lipschitz singularities holds great potential for enhancing the performance of diffusion models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach, dubbed E-TSDM, which alleviates the Lipschitz singularities of the diffusion mode",
