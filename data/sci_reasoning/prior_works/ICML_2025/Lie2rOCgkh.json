  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014posterior causal estimands for retrospective attribution with continuous outcomes\u2014builds directly on the binary-outcome attribution literature and mediation theory. Tian and Pearl\u2019s work on probabilities of causation supplied the central attribution lens and the logic for identifying individual-level causal responsibility under assumptions like monotonicity, which this paper generalizes from binary to continuous outcomes via posterior intervention, total, and natural direct effects. Pearl\u2019s formulation of natural direct/indirect effects provides the conceptual template for the posterior natural direct effect, while Robins and Greenland\u2019s foundational treatment of direct/indirect effects anchors the causal decomposition the authors adapt to multi-cause settings.\n\nIdentification hinges on conditions that trace back to established frameworks. Imai, Keele, and Yamamoto\u2019s sequential ignorability gives a practical, testable path to identifying natural effects; the present work adopts this to justify identification of posterior estimands given observed data. Manski\u2019s monotone treatment response informs the monotonicity assumption the authors use to sharpen identification in observational settings. Finally, the paper\u2019s perfect positive rank condition echoes rank-preserving ideas from Robins and Tsiatis, imposing an ordering on counterfactual outcomes that enables identification for continuous responses; the broader bounding perspective of Balke and Pearl motivates how monotonicity-type restrictions yield identifiable quantities when full information is unavailable. Together, these works directly scaffold the paper\u2019s shift from binary to continuous-outcome causal attribution and its accompanying identification and estimation results.",
