  "synthesis_narrative": "Early-cycle, feature-engineered prediction of battery lifetime demonstrated that a small number of initial cycles can reliably forecast end-of-life, with Severson et al. defining the task, features, and random-forest baselines that became de facto standards. Attia et al. showed how such early-life predictors can be operationalized in closed-loop fast-charging optimization, highlighting the importance of reproducible workflows that transfer across datasets and use cases. The BEEP library began to package data preprocessing and early-prediction featurization into software, but remained limited in scope of datasets, models, and unified benchmarking. The NASA PCoE Li-ion battery dataset established canonical RUL/SOH tasks, yet comparisons were often apples-to-oranges due to incompatible formats and evaluation protocols. Beyond batteries, Matbench proved that community benchmarks with standardized data, tasks, and leaderboards can accelerate progress through fair, repeatable comparisons. Long-term cycling collections such as the Oxford Battery Degradation Dataset provided diverse, real-world aging trajectories that stress-test models but lacked a common schema across sources.\nBuilding on these pieces, a clear opportunity emerged: consolidate disparate preprocessing, feature sets, datasets, and evaluation conventions into a single, standardized platform that spans classic and modern models. By encoding Severson-style features and NASA/OBDD task formulations within a Matbench-inspired benchmark framework\u2014and by broadening and systematizing the software capabilities pioneered by BEEP\u2014the current work creates a unified platform where methods are directly comparable, data interoperability is guaranteed, and end-to-end battery degradation modeling becomes practical and reproducible for both battery scientists and ML researchers.",

    "abstract": "Battery degradation remains a pivotal concern in the energy storage domain, with machine learning emerging as a potent tool to drive forward insights and solutions. However, this intersection of electrochemical science and machine learning poses complex challenges. Machine learning experts often grapple with the intricacies of battery science, while battery researchers face hurdles in adapting intricate models tailored to specific datasets. Beyond this, a cohesive standard for battery degradation modeling, inclusive of data formats and evaluative benchmarks, is conspicuously absent.  Recognizing these impediments, we present BatteryML\u2014a one-step, all-encompass, and  open-source platform designed to unify data preprocessing, feature extraction, and the implementation of both traditional and state-of-the-art models. This streamlined approach promises to enhance the practicality and efficiency of research applications. BatteryML seeks to fill this void, fostering an environment where expe",
