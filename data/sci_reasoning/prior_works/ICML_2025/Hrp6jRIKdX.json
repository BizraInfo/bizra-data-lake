  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core claim\u2014that diffusion models generalize through localized denoising operations\u2014rests on a precise convergence of denoising-based generative modeling and classical patch-wise denoising. DDPM formalized the discrete-time denoising objective and reverse process that modern diffusion models optimize, while score-based methods and their SDE formulation established that these denoisers approximate gradients of noise-smoothed densities at each noise level. Vincent\u2019s connection between denoising and score matching provides the mechanistic bridge: denoisers are local estimators of the score, implying that accurate local operations can approximate the training objective over much of the data distribution. Tweedie\u2019s formula then supplies the practical route to a theoretically optimal, training-free comparator: it connects the posterior mean denoiser to the score of the corrupted density, allowing an empirical Bayes-style construction of optimal empirical denoisers from data. On the algorithmic side, classical image restoration demonstrated that strong denoising can be achieved by aggregating local patch-wise estimators\u2014EPLL explicitly turns local patch denoisers into whole-image restoration and Non-Local Means shows that data-driven local averaging is effective without training. The present work synthesizes these threads: it instantiates Tweedie/score-based optimal empirical denoisers locally and aggregates them in an EPLL-like fashion, then shows these training-free constructions closely track neural diffusion denoisers across forward and reverse processes, offering a mechanistic explanation of generalization and improving MSE over prior approximations.",
