  "synthesis_narrative": "Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis introduced a latent-variable Gaussian generative model with EM inference that tied PCA to Factor Analysis, but constrained representation to a single linear subspace. Mixtures of Probabilistic PCA partially eased this by stitching local linear PPCA components, revealing that piecewise-linear patches can approximate curvature yet fail to impose a coherent global geometry. Principal Curves provided a constructive way to fit a smooth low-dimensional manifold through data with well-defined orthogonal projections and normal directions. In geometric statistics, Principal Geodesic Analysis showed how to replace straight lines with geodesics and work in tangent spaces around a Fr\u00e9chet mean, demonstrating that intrinsic coordinates can generalize PCA to curved spaces\u2014albeit deterministically. Pennec\u2019s framework supplied the core Riemannian tools\u2014Fr\u00e9chet means, exponential/log maps, and parallel transport\u2014that enable geodesic distances and tangent\u2013normal coordinate systems around manifolds. In neural population analysis, Gaussian-Process Factor Analysis established a probabilistic low-dimensional framework widely used in practice but restricted by a linear observation model; relatedly, GP-LVM offered probabilistic nonlinearity without explicit geometric structure or interpretable along-manifold coordinates. Together these works outlined a gap: a PPCA-like probabilistic model that respects a learned manifold\u2019s intrinsic geometry rather than relying on patchwork linearity or unstructured nonlinear mappings. The natural next step was to first fit a smooth manifold (\u00e0 la principal curves) and then endow it with Riemannian tools (from PGA and Pennec) to define geodesic and normal coordinates, embedding them in a PPCA-style generative model. This synthesis yields a geometry-aware probabilistic dimensionality reduction method that retains interpretability and tractable inference while capturing curved structure crucial for neural data.",

    "abstract": "Dimensionality reduction is critical across various domains of science including neuroscience.  Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) is a prominent dimensionality reduction method that provides a probabilistic approach unlike the deterministic approach of PCA and serves as a connection between PCA and Factor Analysis (FA). Despite their power, PPCA and its extensions are mainly based on linear models and can only describe the data in a Euclidean coordinate system around the mean of data. However, in many neuroscience applications, data may be distributed around a nonlinear geometry (i.e., manifold) rather than lying in the Euclidean space around the mean. We develop Probabilistic Geometric Principal Component Analysis (PGPCA) for such datasets as a new dimensionality reduction algorithm that can explicitly incorporate knowledge about a given nonlinear manifold that is first fitted from these data. Further, we show how in addition to the Euclidean coordinate system, a geome",
