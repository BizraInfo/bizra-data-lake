  "synthesis_narrative": "The core contribution\u2014proving that every metric admits an O(1)-IP-stable clustering and giving an efficient algorithm\u2014builds directly on the problem formulation and open gap left by Ahmadi et al. (ICML\u201922), who introduced IP stability, showed 1-IP feasibility is NP-hard, and could only guarantee O(n)-IP stability. To close this, the authors leverage classical randomized metric partitioning. The CKR multiway-cut rounding provides a Lipschitz separation guarantee that the probability a pair is cut scales with their distance. Combined with Bartal\u2019s and FRT\u2019s probabilistic tree embeddings and hierarchical decompositions, this enables a multi-scale construction where, for each point, most of its local neighborhood remains within its cluster with high probability, keeping its average intra-cluster distance within a constant factor of its average distance to other clusters.\n\nGupta\u2013Krauthgamer\u2013Lee\u2019s padded decomposition perspective further supplies per-ball containment guarantees essential for bounding per-point losses when partitioning at appropriate scales, a key step in achieving constant factors in general metrics. Conceptually, the work is situated within the broader stability literature (Bilu\u2013Linial), adopting the insight that structural stability notions can yield qualitatively stronger guarantees than worst-case approximations. Finally, the fairness-in-clustering line (Chierichetti et al.) motivates per-point guarantees and helps interpret IP-stability as an individual-level fairness/stability constraint. Together, these works provide both the formal objective and the decomposition toolkit that make the constant-factor existence and algorithms possible, and they extend naturally to max/min distance variants by requiring stronger per-ball containment properties at selected scales.",
