  "synthesis_narrative": "Proportional fairness in clustering was crystallized by the fairlet framework, which encoded demographic-parity-style constraints into a combinatorial structure that could be paired with classical k-clustering objectives. Subsequent progress showed that exact fairness is often too restrictive, and that permitting a controlled multiplicative violation can recover efficient approximations; in particular, bicriteria designs demonstrated that a (1+\u03b5) slack in group proportions can dramatically simplify algorithmic design while preserving utility. On the algorithmic side, fair clustering techniques were scaled in the offline setting, combining fairlets with local search to achieve practical performance and to clarify which parts of the pipeline bore the computational burden. Orthogonally, sliding-window stream processing introduced smooth histograms as a general blueprint to maintain summaries over the active window, and coreset constructions for k-means/k-median provided compact surrogates with strong cost guarantees suitable for streaming maintenance. Dynamic-and-streaming coreset frameworks further showed how to realize insertion-only k-clustering approximations in small space.\nBringing these strands together highlights a tension: insertion-only streaming approximations benefit from coresets, but the windowed, adversarial nature of sliding windows undermines strict proportional fairness. The natural synthesis\u2014implied by bicriteria fairness\u2014relaxes fairness by (1+\u03b5) and then marries smooth-histogram window maintenance with coreset-based k-clustering summaries. This yields near-optimal poly(k, \u03b5\u207b\u00b9, log n)-space algorithms while the impossibility of finite approximation under exact fairness explains the sharp separation from the insertion-only model.",

    "abstract": "We study streaming algorithms for proportionally fair clustering, a notion originally suggested by Chierichetti et al. (2017), in the sliding window model. We show that although there exist efficient streaming algorithms in the insertion-only model, surprisingly no algorithm can achieve finite ratio without violating the fairness constraint in sliding window. Hence, the problem of fair clustering is a rare separation between the insertion-only streaming model and the sliding window model. On the other hand, we show that if the fairness constraint is relaxed by a multiplicative $(1+\\varepsilon)$ factor, there exists a $(1 + \\varepsilon)$-approximate sliding window algorithm that uses $\\text{poly}(k\\varepsilon^{-1}\\log n)$ space. This achieves essentially the best parameters (up to degree in the polynomial) provided the aforementioned lower bound. We also implement a number of empirical evaluations on real datasets to complement our theoretical results.",
