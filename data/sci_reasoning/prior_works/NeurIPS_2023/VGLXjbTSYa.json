  "synthesis_narrative": "Delegated Classification fuses classic principal\u2013agent contract theory with statistical decision theory and modern empirical scaling laws to design incentive-aware ML delegation. On the economic side, Holmstr\u00f6m\u2019s moral hazard framework and informativeness principle justify tying compensation to observable, performance-related signals, while Grossman and Hart provide the canonical optimization setup for deriving optimal contracts under moral hazard. Innes\u2019s result is pivotal for the paper\u2019s core structural claim: with monotone likelihood ratios and limited liability, optimal contracts collapse to simple threshold schemes\u2014mirroring the debt/option-like payoffs known in incentive contracting. The paper\u2019s most distinctive theoretical bridge connects these contract structures to Neyman\u2013Pearson\u2019s optimal hypothesis testing: in the binary-action case, the budget-constrained, most powerful incentive scheme is isomorphic to a likelihood-ratio test with a threshold, formally linking contract optimality to classic statistical decision rules. This equivalence both clarifies why thresholds arise and provides a principled recipe for constructing them. Practically, the authors exploit contemporary insights on learning curves and scaling laws\u2014empirically documented by Hestness et al. and Kaplan et al.\u2014to estimate model performance from small-scale trials and forecast outcomes at deployment scale. This enables data-efficient contract design: using limited pilot data to set thresholds and payment levels that align incentives while respecting budgets. Together, these strands yield a clean, theoretically grounded, and empirically actionable framework for delegating ML tasks to rational agents.",
