  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core idea\u2014using pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models as control-ready perceptual backbones\u2014emerges from two converging lines of work. On the robotics side, CLIP and downstream systems like CLIPort demonstrated that internet-scale vision\u2013language pretraining can bootstrap manipulation, yet also revealed a bottleneck: contrastive features often lack the fine-grained visuo-spatial detail required for precise control. RT-2 further solidified the value of web-scale pretraining for action but still leaned on recognition-centric representations. On the generative modeling side, DDPM established denoising architectures whose U-Net internals learn rich multi-scale features, and Latent Diffusion (Stable Diffusion) introduced text conditioning via cross-attention, yielding representations aligned with spatial structure. Follow-up analyses such as Attend-and-Excite showed that cross-attention maps in diffusion models encode object-level grounding and localization, while ControlNet demonstrated that these models can be precisely steered by spatial conditions\u2014strong evidence that their internal states capture the spatial granularity control demands. Building upon these insights, the present work proposes extracting text-conditioned, intermediate features from Stable Diffusion to form Stable Control Representations, explicitly targeting the spatial precision missing from contrastive VL features. Thus, it reframes pretraining for embodied control from contrastive recognition to text-conditioned generative modeling, leveraging the diffusion U-Net\u2019s cross-attentional, geometry-aware representations to improve policy learning and transfer.",
