  "synthesis_narrative": "VASA-1\u2019s core advance\u2014holistic, lifelike audio-driven talking-face generation in real time\u2014sits at the intersection of two lines of work: latent-space diffusion for efficient, high-quality synthesis and video-learned facial motion representations for single-image animation. Latent Diffusion Models (Rombach et al., 2022) supply the key efficiency and scalability insight: train generative models in a compact latent, enabling 512\u00d7512 synthesis at interactive rates. VASA-1 transposes this idea to a dedicated face latent learned from videos, so diffusion operates directly on an expressive representation that captures facial nuances and head dynamics.\nFrom the image animation side, First Order Motion Model (Siarohin et al., 2019) and Zakharov et al. (2019) established how to animate a single image by learning motion from videos while preserving identity. VASA-1 preserves the single-image paradigm but replaces explicit keypoints/warps with a disentangled latent space that supports global, temporally coherent dynamics. Prior audio-driven works shape the problem definition and control signals: Wav2Lip (2020) set rigorous lip-sync expectations, PC-AVS (2021) highlighted disentanglement and pose control, while SadTalker (2023) improved natural head motion via 3DMM coefficients. VASA-1 achieves comparable or better synchronization and expressiveness without relying on 3D parametric intermediates by letting diffusion in a learned face latent jointly model lips, expressions, and head motion. EMO (2023) further motivated affective realism; VASA-1 operationalizes this goal by generating a wide spectrum of affect and introducing broader evaluation metrics, culminating in a unified, diffusion-based generator for lifelike talking heads.",
