  "synthesis_narrative": "Modern data-driven weather models demonstrated that large neural forecasters trained on reanalysis can achieve skillful medium-range predictions: Pangu-Weather showed strong performance by learning from ERA5 fields with 3D architectures, and GraphCast reinforced this by delivering competitive 10-day guidance, again from reanalysis. Early deep-learning work specific to typhoons, such as R\u00fcttgers et al., framed track prediction as a sequence learning problem using data proxies (e.g., satellite or reanalysis), but lacked explicit physical priors. In parallel, physics-guided learning advanced the idea of embedding domain knowledge into neural models; PGNN illustrated how incorporating physical guidance improves generalization, while PINNs proposed enforcing PDE residuals but proved difficult to scale to high-dimensional, global NWP settings. Classical tropical cyclone guidance such as the Beta and Advection Model (BAM) distilled the core physical insight that deep-layer environmental winds and the beta effect steer cyclone motion, effectively identifying the most predictive physical signals for track evolution. Operational NWP systems like the Met Office Unified Model (UM) provide these steering-relevant fields in real time, without the latency of reanalysis. Together, these works revealed a gap: reanalysis-powered learning is powerful but operationally delayed, while pure data-driven track models underuse well-known steering physics. The natural next step is to combine operational NWP fields that encode steering dynamics with a learning system guided by physics, avoiding heavy PDE residual enforcement. By conditioning a track predictor on UM-derived physically meaningful features, the approach preserves the strengths of data-driven forecasting while removing dependence on reanalysis and enabling reliable >72 h guidance.",

    "abstract": "In the face of escalating climate changes, typhoon intensities and their ensuing damage have surged. Accurate trajectory prediction is crucial for effective damage control. Traditional physics-based models, while comprehensive, are computationally intensive and rely heavily on the expertise of forecasters. Contemporary data-driven methods often rely on reanalysis data, which can be considered to be the closest to the true representation of weather conditions. However, reanalysis data is not produced in real-time and requires time for adjustment since prediction models are calibrated with observational data. This reanalysis data, such as ERA5, falls short in challenging real-world situations. Optimal preparedness necessitates predictions at least 72 hours in advance, beyond the capabilities of standard physics models. In response to these constraints, we present an approach that harnesses real-time Unified Model (UM) data, sidestepping the limitations of reanalysis data. Our model provi",
