  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014nearly tight lower and upper bounds for differentially private min s\u2013t cut and a private multiway k-cut algorithm with superior privacy scaling\u2014builds on three intertwined lines of work. First, foundational differential privacy machinery (Dwork\u2013McSherry\u2013Nissim\u2013Smith) and the exponential mechanism (McSherry\u2013Talwar) supply the template to privatize combinatorial selection problems like min-cut. Because the s\u2013t cut objective has bounded edge sensitivity, perturb-and-select strategies or exponential-mechanism-style scoring can output near-optimal cuts while preserving almost the same runtime as standard max-flow/min-cut algorithms, realizing the paper\u2019s \u201cprivacy at no runtime cost.\u201d Second, composition theorems (Dwork\u2013Rothblum\u2013Vadhan; Kairouz\u2013Oh\u2013Viswanath) define the natural baseline for multiway k-cut: running a private s\u2013t cut routine multiple times and composing privacy losses. The paper departs from this by exploiting graph structure to reduce the number and arrangement of private invocations, thereby achieving privacy guarantees that improve exponentially in k relative to naive advanced composition. Third, classical structure for cuts and multiway separation (Gomory\u2013Hu trees; Dahlhaus et al.\u2019s isolating cuts) enables turning multi-terminal separation into a carefully controlled set of s\u2013t cut computations on a laminar/structured family of cuts, which is crucial for tight privacy accounting and improved utility. Finally, general DP optimization frameworks and lower-bound techniques (Hardt\u2013Rothblum) inform the paper\u2019s near-tight accuracy lower bounds, aligning the achievable utility of their private min-cut procedures with principled limitations.",
