  "synthesis_narrative": "SchNOrb introduced the idea of directly learning Kohn\u2013Sham operators and wavefunction information in the atomic-orbital basis with symmetry-aware neural networks, and enforced basic orbital orthonormality through tailored losses, but was limited to small molecules and modest datasets. OrbNet demonstrated that symmetry-adapted atomic-orbital features provide a scalable, AO-centric representation for learning quantum-chemical observables across large and chemically diverse corpora, though it targeted energies rather than the operators underlying ground-state properties. The PubChemQC project established a practical pipeline for large-scale, PubChem-wide first-principles computation, showing how to assemble massive, standardized molecular quantum datasets at scale. Earlier, work on bypassing Kohn\u2013Sham with machine learning advocated physics-informed supervision, targeting electron-density and related quantities rather than purely data-fit losses. More recently, DM21 showed that embedding hard physical constraints into the learning objective reduces well-known DFT pathologies, improving generalization and physical fidelity. Finally, EGNN provided a light-weight, scalable equivariant message-passing architecture that encodes roto-translational symmetry for 3D molecular graphs and supports tensorial outputs compatible with operator symmetries.\nTaken together, these works reveal both the representation and architectural ingredients needed to predict operator-level quantities and the importance of physics-derived objectives for robustness, while also exposing two gaps: prior Hamiltonian predictors struggled to scale and energy-focused AO models did not recover operators or enforce ground-state physicality. By marrying an AO-centric, equivariant architecture with a PubChem-scale dataset and a constraint-driven loss aligned with wavefunction-derived observables, the present work naturally emerges as the next step to deliver scalable, physically faithful Kohn\u2013Sham Hamiltonian prediction.",

    "abstract": "Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a pivotal method within quantum chemistry and materials science, with its core involving the construction and solution of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. Despite its importance, the application of DFT is frequently limited by the substantial computational resources required to construct the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. In response to these limitations, current research has employed deep-learning models to efficiently predict molecular and solid Hamiltonians, with roto-translational symmetries encoded in their neural networks. However, the scalability of prior models may be problematic when applied to large molecules, resulting in non-physical predictions of ground-state properties. In this study, we generate a substantially larger training set (PubChemQH) than used previously and use it to create a scalable model for DFT calculations with physical accuracy. For our model, we introduce a loss function derived from physical principles, which we call Wavefunction A",
