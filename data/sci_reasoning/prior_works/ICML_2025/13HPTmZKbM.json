  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core idea\u2014upweighting easy target samples as judged by the pretrained model\u2019s loss to mitigate catastrophic forgetting\u2014stands at the intersection of three lines of work. First, Learning without Forgetting and knowledge distillation established that a prior model\u2019s outputs can regularize adaptation when original data are unavailable. While those works align predictions or logits, the present paper repurposes the pretrained model\u2019s signal to define a curriculum over the fine-tuning data via loss-based weights, shifting the locus of control from output/parameter matching to sample space.\nSecond, curriculum and self-paced learning demonstrated that emphasizing easy examples can beneficially shape optimization trajectories. The new method instantiates this principle in transfer: treating low-loss examples (for the pretrained model) as anchors that keep optimization near the source solution, thereby curbing drift responsible for forgetting.\nThird, parameter-space regularizers like EWC and L2-SP aim to preserve prior knowledge by constraining weight updates. The proposed approach is complementary: rather than penalizing parameter movement, it steers gradient contributions through data reweighting, avoiding reliance on old-task data, Fisher estimates, or specialized parameterization.\nFinally, importance weighting under covariate shift provides a distributional lens: low pretrained loss indicates samples close to the source manifold; upweighting them reduces effective shift during fine-tuning, aligning with the paper\u2019s theoretical claim that learning stalls in subspaces prone to overfitting. Together, these works directly underpin the paper\u2019s sample-weighted fine-tuning strategy for mitigating forgetting.",
