  "synthesis_narrative": "Topology-conditioned control emerged as a key theme in prior work. NerveNet proposed graph-structured policies that explicitly pass messages along a robot\u2019s body graph, showing that encoding morphology enables compact and generalizable control. Building on this, learning to control self-assembling morphologies with graph neural networks showed that as structures change, the same policy class can adapt online by leveraging graph-based communication among parts. In parallel, RoboGrammar introduced a graph grammar to generate valid robot topologies and coupled it to controller optimization, but its combinatorial search and decoupled pipeline exposed scalability and integration limits. Evolution Gym then crystallized embodiment co-design as a benchmark with modular morphologies and RL controllers, making clear the dual challenges of combinatorial design and the tight interdependence between morphology and control that slow optimization. Independently, RUDDER demonstrated that redistributing returns over time can dramatically improve temporal credit assignment in long-horizon RL. Finally, Transformer-based control across morphologies (e.g., Transform2Act) showed that self-attention can serve as a morphology-aware aggregator for control. Together, these works reveal that effective co-design needs (i) a morphology-aware yet lightweight representation that unifies design and control, and (ii) principled credit assignment to prevent one stage from dominating learning. BodyGen synthesizes these insights by using topology-aware self-attention to encode both body structure and control and by introducing temporal credit assignment to balance rewards between design and control, naturally addressing the efficiency bottlenecks highlighted by prior benchmarks and pipelines.",

With our findings, BodyGen achieves an average **60.03%** performance improvement against state-of-the-art baselines. We provid",
