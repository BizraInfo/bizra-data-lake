  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014an if-and-only-if characterization that additive value decomposition is valid precisely when the multi-agent MDP\u2019s transition operator is non-entangled\u2014sits at the intersection of two lines of work. From multi-agent reinforcement learning, Value-Decomposition Networks and QMIX established practical and widely used structural biases: summing per-agent utilities and monotonic mixing, respectively. These methods assumed, but did not fully explain, when such decompositions capture the true joint value. Earlier structured control frameworks\u2014Boutilier et al.\u2019s factored MDPs and Guestrin\u2013Koller\u2013Parr\u2019s coordination graphs\u2014showed that exploiting sparse, factored transitions can make decompositions accurate and tractable, hinting that the crux lies in how transitions couple agents.\n\nThe paper translates this intuition into a precise operator-level statement by importing separability concepts from quantum information. Peres\u2019 separability criterion anchors the notion that an operator\u2019s lack of entanglement certifies decomposability, which here becomes the non-entanglement of the transition kernel. Building on axiomatic approaches to entanglement measurement (Vedral et al.), the authors define a \u2018Markov entanglement\u2019 metric tailored to stochastic operators and prove it upper-bounds the error incurred by additive value approximations. Together, these influences yield a unifying theory: classical MARL decompositions are exact for separable (non-entangled) transition dynamics and degrade gracefully as measured entanglement increases\u2014thereby explaining when VDN/QMIX-like methods succeed and how far they can be pushed in the presence of interaction-induced coupling.",
