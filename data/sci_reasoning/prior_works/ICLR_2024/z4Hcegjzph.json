  "synthesis_narrative": "BEiT introduced masked image modeling for Vision Transformers by predicting masked visual tokens, crystallizing the pretext of learning robust representations from partially observed inputs. Masked Autoencoders then simplified this paradigm by operating on image patches, encoding only the visible subset and reconstructing the masked ones with a lightweight decoder, demonstrating that aggressive masking ratios can still yield strong representations. In parallel, the random projection literature established that linear dimensionality reduction can preserve geometric structure: the Johnson\u2013Lindenstrauss lemma provided rigorous distortion bounds for random projections, while orthogonal random features showed that enforcing orthogonality in the projection matrix reduces variance and better preserves information than i.i.d. Gaussian projections. Randomized matrix algorithms further detailed how data can be decomposed into a random subspace and its orthogonal complement, offering a practical way to partition information across complementary components of a signal.\nBringing these strands together highlighted an opportunity: replace discrete, binary masking in MIM with continuous, structure-preserving random orthogonal projections that act as controllable information throttles. The JL bounds and orthogonal-feature variance reductions suggest a principled way to guarantee limited distortion, while the randomized range/complement viewpoint naturally yields an \u201cunmasking\u201d signal from the complementary subspace for reconstruction. Within the MAE-style encode-visible/reconstruct-missing scaffold, this synthesis leads directly to a projection-based masking mechanism that enables locally varying masking degrees with theoretical noise control.",

    "abstract": "Masked Image Modeling (MIM) is a powerful self-supervised strategy for visual pre-training without the use of labels. MIM applies random crops to input images, processes them with an encoder, and then recovers the masked inputs with a decoder, which encourages the network to capture and learn structural information about objects and scenes. The intermediate feature representations obtained from MIM are suitable for fine-tuning on downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose an Image Modeling framework based on random orthogonal projection instead of binary masking as in MIM. Our proposed Random Orthogonal Projection Image Modeling (ROPIM) reduces spatially-wise token information under guaranteed bound on the noise variance and can be considered as masking entire spatial image area under locally varying masking degrees. Since ROPIM uses a random subspace for the projection that realizes the masking step, the readily available complement of the subspace can be used during unmasking to pro",
