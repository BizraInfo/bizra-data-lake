  "synthesis_narrative": "L-CAD\u2019s core insight is to unify language guidance with grayscale structure for colorization under any-level textual descriptions, achieved by riding on a strong pretrained text\u2013image diffusion prior and carefully controlling how text and structure interact during sampling. Latent Diffusion Models (Stable Diffusion) provide the cross-modal backbone whose learned color and semantics enable filling in unspecified regions, a necessity when descriptions are incomplete. Palette demonstrated that diffusion models naturally preserve luminance structure for colorization, motivating L-CAD to retain diffusion-based i2i framing while adding text conditioning. On the sampling side, Classifier-Free Guidance and DDIM give the levers for trading off conditional signals and shaping deterministic trajectories; L-CAD\u2019s novel sampler explicitly balances text tokens with grayscale constraints to produce instance-aware, non-destructive color edits. To curb ghosting and color bleeding, RePaint\u2019s resampling discipline and Blended Latent Diffusion\u2019s locality-preserving latent operations inform mechanisms that keep changes confined to semantically relevant regions. Finally, ControlNet\u2019s controlled conditioning suggests an architectural route to inject structure from the input image via alignment modules, ensuring spatial fidelity while the text prior supplies plausible colors. Together, these works directly scaffold L-CAD\u2019s contributions: leveraging a robust language prior, preserving local structure, and introducing an instance-aware sampling strategy that handles any-level descriptions in complex scenes.",
