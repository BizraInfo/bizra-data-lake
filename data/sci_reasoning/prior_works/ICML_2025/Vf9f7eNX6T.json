  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s central thesis\u2014that multimodal representation collapse arises from feature superposition in a capacity-limited fusion head\u2014stands on two converging lines of prior work. From the fusion side, Tensor Fusion Network (Zadeh et al.) and its low-rank successor (Liu et al.) formalized how modalities are combined in a shared representation, with LMF introducing explicit rank constraints. These architectures create the precise conditions\u2014shared neurons under tight rank budgets\u2014where the paper proves that noisy features from one modality can entangle with predictive features from another, masking the former and inducing collapse. Modern transformer-based fusion such as MulT (Tsai et al.) serves as the practical, high-capacity baseline where the phenomenon is empirically visible and where the proposed remedy must operate. From the representation theory side, toy models of superposition (Elhage et al.) provide the conceptual mechanism: when many features are packed into a limited subspace, interference arises via shared neurons. The paper translates this mechanism to multimodal fusion and formalizes collapse in that setting. To prevent collapse, the work leverages the knowledge distillation paradigm (Hinton et al.) and, in particular, cross-modal distillation (Gupta et al.), proving that distillation implicitly frees rank bottlenecks and disentangles modal representations. This insight motivates an explicit basis reallocation algorithm that reallocates the limited representational subspace across modalities, yielding robust fusion and improved handling of missing modalities.",
