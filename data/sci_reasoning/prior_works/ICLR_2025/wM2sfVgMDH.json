  "synthesis_narrative": "Diffusion models were adapted to control by Janner et al., who proposed planning with trajectory-level diffusion and showed that sampling could be steered by objective signals, seeding the idea that generative denoising could serve as a planner. Dhariwal and Nichol established classifier-guided diffusion, computing gradients of conditional likelihoods to guide denoising toward desired attributes\u2014a mechanism that generalizes naturally to multi-objective control signals. Ho and Salimans introduced classifier-free guidance, formalizing a tractable way to trade off data fidelity and conditioning strength during sampling, clarifying the knob to balance competing preferences. In robotics, Diffusion Policy showed that action-diffusion policies yield robust closed-loop control while preserving multi-modality, validating diffusion policies as controllers rather than one-shot generators. Within autonomous driving, UniAD argued for a unified architecture that jointly models prediction and planning so that downstream planning can account for interactive agents, laying a template for cooperative behaviors. DiffAD demonstrated diffusion-based end-to-end driving but still depended on rule-based refinements, revealing the need for principled guidance that enforces safety and objective balance during sampling. Together these works expose a gap: trajectory diffusion can plan, guidance can steer generation, and unified architectures enable cooperation, yet driving needs a flexible, multi-objective guidance scheme that removes hand-crafted fallbacks. The present work synthesizes trajectory diffusion with classifier-style guidance to learn a trajectory score and apply adjustable, differentiable objectives during denoising, unifying prediction and planning in a transformer policy that achieves safe, multi-modal, closed-loop driving without rule-based refinement.",

    "abstract": "Achieving human-like driving behaviors in complex open-world environments is a critical challenge in autonomous driving. Contemporary learning-based planning approaches such as imitation learning methods often struggle to balance competing objectives and lack of safety assurance,due to limited adaptability and inadequacy in learning complex multi-modal behaviors commonly exhibited in human planning, not to mention their strong reliance on the fallback strategy with predefined rules. We propose a novel transformer-based Diffusion Planner for closed-loop planning, which can effectively model multi-modal driving behavior and ensure trajectory quality without any rule-based refinement. Our model supports joint modeling of both prediction and planning tasks under the same architecture, enabling cooperative behaviors between vehicles. Moreover, by learning the gradient of the trajectory score function and employing a flexible classifier guidance mechanism, Diffusion Planner effectively achie",
