  "synthesis_narrative": "Continuous neural implicit fields made high-fidelity 3D shape representations practical: DeepSDF showed that signed distance functions can be learned as continuous fields conditioned on a code, enabling precise, watertight surfaces, while Occupancy Networks framed learning shapes directly in function space to capture detailed geometry. In population modeling, Gaussian Process Morphable Models provided interpretable, probabilistic shape spaces supporting analysis with covariates, but relied on linear, correspondence-based assumptions that limit expressiveness. Atlas-based computational anatomy, grounded in LDDMM, established that population variability can be described as deformations of a template via diffeomorphic flows, furnishing a principled geometric scaffold for population trends. Complementing this, geodesic regression formalized the regression of shapes on covariates within Riemannian geometry, typically modeling effects along geodesic trajectories and supporting hypothesis testing, yet not designed for disentangled, multi-feature interpretability in complex, nonlinear regimes. Neural Additive Models, in parallel, introduced an interpretable deep-learning recipe: feature-wise subnetworks whose outputs sum to a prediction, preserving additivity and attribution per feature. Together these works exposed a clear opportunity: marry the geometric interpretability of atlas-based and regression-based shape analysis with the fidelity of neural implicit fields, while importing NAM-style additivity to disentangle covariate effects. NAISR is the natural synthesis\u2014learning an implicit atlas and per-covariate deformation fields that add linearly in shape space, thus preserving interpretability, enabling patient-specific counterfactuals and shape transfer, and overcoming the linearity and correspondence constraints of classical statistical shape models.",

    "abstract": "Deep implicit functions (DIFs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for many computer vision tasks such as 3D shape reconstruction, generation, registration, completion, editing, and understanding. However, given a set of 3D shapes with associated covariates there is at present no shape representation method which allows to precisely represent the shapes while capturing the individual dependencies on each covariate. Such a method would be of high utility to researchers to discover knowledge hidden in a population of shapes. For scientific shape discovery purpose, we propose a 3D Neural Additive Model for Interpretable Shape Representation ($\\texttt{NAISR}$) which describes individual shapes by deforming a shape atlas in accordance to the effect of disentangled covariates. Our approach captures shape population trends and allows for patient-specific predictions through shape transfer. $\\texttt{NAISR}$ is the first approach to combine the benefits of deep implicit shape representations wi",
