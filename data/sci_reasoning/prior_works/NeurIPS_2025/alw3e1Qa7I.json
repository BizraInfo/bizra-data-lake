  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014projection-based Lyapunov functions that guarantee convergence of aggregate rewards and costs to an optimal region in fully heterogeneous weakly coupled MDPs\u2014sits at the intersection of two lines of work: decomposition-based relaxations for WCMDPs and Lyapunov methods for constrained stochastic systems. Whittle (1988) initiated the weakly coupled paradigm via a Lagrangian relaxation, decomposing multi-arm control into tractable per-arm subproblems. Hawkins (2003) and Adelman\u2013Mersereau (2008) developed this relaxation program for WCMDPs, yielding dual bounds and implementable heuristics\u2014precisely the structure needed to define the optimal reward\u2013cost region that the present paper targets. On the asymptotic side, Weber\u2013Weiss (1990) established that in large systems with homogeneous (or finitely many) types, index policies are asymptotically optimal, providing a benchmark the current work advances by proving the first asymptotic optimality in the fully heterogeneous average-reward regime.\nConcurrently, the constrained-queueing literature forged Lyapunov-based control. Tassiulas\u2013Ephremides (1992) introduced Lyapunov drift to ensure stability under constraints, while Stolyar (2004) showcased projection-based Lyapunov functions\u2014squared distances to a capacity/workload region via orthogonal projection\u2014to certify convergence and state-space collapse. Neely (2010) unified drift-plus-penalty approaches, linking utility optimality with constraint satisfaction. The present paper fuses these threads: it uses WCMDP Lagrangian/relaxation structure to define an optimal region and imports projection-based Lyapunov ideas to drive the (heterogeneous) system state toward that region, yielding an O(1/\u221aN) optimality gap that generalizes large-system guarantees beyond homogeneous settings.",
