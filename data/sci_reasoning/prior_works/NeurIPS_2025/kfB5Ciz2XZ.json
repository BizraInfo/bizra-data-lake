  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014optimizing a CVaR risk objective by synthesizing informative, high-loss inputs and training with loss-weighted importance sampling\u2014stands on two pillars: tail-risk optimization and guided generative modeling. Rockafellar and Uryasev\u2019s formulation of CVaR provides the precise risk measure and tractable optimization surrogate the authors target. Building on this, Namkoong and Duchi\u2019s distributionally robust optimization view shows that risk-averse training equates to reweighting distributions toward high-loss samples, offering a principled blueprint for the paper\u2019s reweighted target distribution and its loss-weighted estimator.\n\nOn the generative side, Song et al.\u2019s score-based diffusion framework supplies a flexible mechanism to sample from complex data distributions. Dhariwal and Nichol\u2019s classifier-guidance demonstrates how to steer diffusion trajectories using gradients of an auxiliary objective; the present work replaces the classifier objective with the reference model\u2019s loss, effectively turning risk signals into an energy to bias synthesis toward tail events. Rubinstein and Kroese\u2019s cross-entropy method contributes the rare-event sampling ethos\u2014adaptively shifting mass to the tail\u2014to which the paper adds modern diffusion-based synthesis.\n\nFinally, the optimization layer is grounded in importance sampling theory for stochastic optimization (Zhao and Zhang), ensuring variance reduction and convergence under the proposed loss-weighted scheme. Risk-sensitive gradient works (e.g., Tamar et al.) underscore the intrinsic high variance when targeting extreme quantiles, directly motivating the need for the paper\u2019s tail-focused sample generation. Together, these works converge to enable a coherent framework: generatively amplify rare, high-loss inputs, weight them correctly, and provably optimize a CVaR objective for robust fine-tuning.",
