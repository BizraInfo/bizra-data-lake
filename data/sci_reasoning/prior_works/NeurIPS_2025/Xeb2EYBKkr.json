  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014a tight characterization of how many short\u2011context transformers are needed to simulate a long\u2011context transformer\u2014rests on two concrete lines of prior work. First, sparse and local attention designs such as Sparse Transformers and Longformer defined the sliding\u2011window masking regimes that practitioners actually use for long sequences. BigBird strengthened this direction with theoretical guarantees on sparse attention\u2019s expressivity. Building directly on these masks and guarantees, the paper proves that sliding\u2011window structures admit optimal O(N/M) simulation with M\u2011length models, and quantifies the exact tradeoff in general settings, including matching lower bounds.\n\nSecond, recent practice showed that \u201cattention sinks\u201d enable streaming with bounded KV state (StreamingLLM). The authors formalize this mechanism and prove that sink tokens reduce the simulation requirement from the worst\u2011case O((N/M)^2) to the optimal O(N/M), thereby offering a principled explanation of why these heuristics work.\n\nSurrounding these architectural threads, foundational theory on transformers\u2019 computational power (On the Turing Completeness of Transformers) provides a rigorous framework to talk about simulating arbitrary transformer computations. Meanwhile, works probing self\u2011attention\u2019s limitations and length extrapolation strategies (Hahn\u2019s lower bounds; ALiBi\u2019s train\u2011short\u2011test\u2011long framing) crystallize the central gap: how to systematically leverage short\u2011context models for long inputs with guarantees. This paper closes that gap by giving constructive upper bounds and matching lower bounds across worst\u2011case and practically relevant masking/sink scenarios.",
