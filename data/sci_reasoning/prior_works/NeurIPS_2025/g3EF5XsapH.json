  "synthesis_narrative": "URDF-Anything\u2019s core contribution\u2014an end-to-end 3D multimodal language model that autoregressively reconstructs articulated objects (parts plus kinematics) and outputs URDF\u2014emerges by unifying three lines of prior work. First, Shape2Motion and PartNet-Mobility established the articulated-object formulation: objects decomposed into motion parts with joint types and parameters, defining the learning targets and benchmarks. These works also exposed a limitation: joint inference of segments and kinematics typically relied on bespoke architectures or multi-stage pipelines, making consistent part\u2013kinematics reasoning fragile. Second, the perception-as-language stream (Pix2Seq) showed that structured visual predictions can be modeled autoregressively as sequences, motivating URDF-Anything to emit a single sequence interleaving segmentation and kinematic tokens for tighter coupling and global consistency. Third, query-based transformer segmentation (DETR, Mask2Former) introduced learned tokens that attend to scene features to produce object/mask predictions; URDF-Anything extends this with specialized [SEG] tokens that interact directly with point-cloud features to yield fine-grained part masks while sharing context with kinematic heads. Finally, the emergence of 3D MLLMs (PointLLM, 3D-LLM) demonstrated practical interfaces between point-cloud encoders and language models; URDF-Anything adopts this modality-LLM bridge but repurposes it from open-ended QA to structured URDF reconstruction. Together, these works directly enable an autoregressive, token-driven 3D MLLM that jointly optimizes segmentation and kinematic parameters in a single coherent pass.",
