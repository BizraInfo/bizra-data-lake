  "synthesis_narrative": "Pseudo-counts established that exploration bonuses can be derived from density estimates over states, connecting novelty to visitation statistics in a principled way. Neural density models then instantiated this idea with PixelCNN, showing practical gains but also exposing computational burden and instability when the representation and data distribution shift during learning. To scale counts to continuous, high-dimensional observations, hashing-based methods proposed SimHash keys to approximate counts, demonstrating that non-parametric schemes can be both simple and effective yet susceptible to collision and rigidity. Random-encoder k-NN\u2013based state entropy showed that local density in feature space can drive efficient exploration without heavy training, while also revealing sensitivity to representation choice and challenges in maintaining coherent long-term statistics. Episodic novelty via k-NN memories highlighted the value of non-parametric, life-long signals, but its per-episode nature limited persistent count accumulation across thousands of episodes. In parallel, inverse dynamics\u2013based self-supervision provided a practical way to shape representations around controllable aspects of the environment, though its single-step formulation is often myopic in long-horizon tasks.\nSynthesizing these insights, the current work replaces parametric density with a streaming, non-parametric clustering estimator to compute pseudo-counts in embedding space, avoiding hash rigidity and k-NN locality while supporting life-long tracking. It complements this with a masked, multi-step generalization of inverse dynamics using transformers to learn temporally predictive embeddings that stabilize the density estimator, naturally addressing the nonstationarity and horizon limits surfaced by prior methods.",

    "abstract": "We introduce Robust Exploration via Clustering-based Online Density Estimation (RECODE), a non-parametric method for novelty-based exploration that estimates visitation counts for clusters of states based on their similarity in a chosen embedding space. By adapting classical clustering to the nonstationary setting of Deep RL, RECODE can efficiently track state visitation counts over thousands of episodes. We further propose a novel generalization of the inverse dynamics loss, which leverages masked transformer architectures for multi-step prediction; which in conjunction with \\DETOCS achieves a new state-of-the-art in a suite of challenging 3D-exploration tasks in DM-Hard-8. RECODE also sets new state-of-the-art in hard exploration Atari games, and is the first agent to reach the end screen in \"Pitfall!\"",
