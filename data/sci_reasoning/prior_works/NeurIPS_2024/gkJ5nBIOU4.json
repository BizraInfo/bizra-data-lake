  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014showing that server-to-worker communication can be strictly improved by correlating downlink compressors and that total bidirectional communication can improve with the number of workers\u2014emerges at the intersection of three lines of prior work. First, MARINA provided the architectural blueprint for compressed distributed optimization with nonconvex guarantees through a reference vector and compressed deviation updates; this work repurposes that template to the downlink and then extends it to M3 for bidirectional compression. Second, a sequence of compression methods\u2014DIANA and the broader literature on doubly-compressed communication\u2014established how to rigorously control variance and bias when both directions are compressed, but did not exploit inter-worker correlation on the downlink; the present paper closes this gap by introducing correlated compressors (instantiated via permutation sparsifiers) that provably reduce downlink complexity as workers increase. Third, stability tools for compression, from error feedback (Karimireddy et al.) to its refined analyses (EF21), motivate the momentum/memory step in M3 that preserves convergence while compounding communication savings. Finally, the function-similarity perspective popularized in federated optimization (FedProx) supplies the heterogeneity model under which worker-scaling gains can be formalized. Together, these strands directly inform MARINA-P\u2019s design with permutation compressors and M3\u2019s bidirectional extension, yielding improved worst-case bidirectional communication complexity under nonconvex objectives with similarity.",
