  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014a balanced binary angular margin loss for semi-supervised multi-label learning\u2014sits at the intersection of self-training SSL and angular-margin metric learning, while explicitly addressing positive/negative imbalance in multi-label settings. Pseudo-labeling (Lee, 2013) established the foundational self-training scheme later strengthened by teacher\u2013student consistency (Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017) and confidence-thresholded pipelines like FixMatch (Sohn et al., 2020). These frameworks enabled effective use of unlabeled data but also exacerbated asymmetries between positive and negative examples (especially with negative sampling), creating the variance bias the authors identify between their feature distributions.\n\nOn the representation side, angular-margin losses such as CosFace (Wang et al., 2018) and ArcFace (Deng et al., 2019) showed that optimizing on a hypersphere with explicit angular margins yields compact, separable feature clusters. This angular view invites reasoning about feature angle distributions per label, which the present work leverages by estimating and transforming these distributions under a Gaussian assumption. Complementing this, imbalance-aware margin and loss design\u2014LDAM (Cao et al., 2019) and Asymmetric Loss (Ridnik et al., 2021)\u2014demonstrated that adjusting decision margins or weighting differently for positives and negatives can counter skewed data. The new loss synthesizes these insights: it adapts the angular-margin formulation to the binary one-vs-rest setting used in multi-label classification and balances positive/negative angle variances per label, estimated iteratively from labeled and pseudo-labeled data. The result directly targets pseudo-label\u2013induced variance bias while preserving the discriminative power of angular-margin learning within modern SSL pipelines.",
