  "synthesis_narrative": "GeoSVR\u2019s core innovation\u2014an explicit sparse-voxel framework for accurate, detailed, and complete surface reconstruction\u2014arises from unifying two lines of prior work: explicit voxel radiance fields and uncertainty-aware geometric supervision. On the representation side, PlenOctrees and NSVF established that sparse voxel/octree carriers can efficiently model radiance fields by focusing computation on occupied space, while Plenoxels showed that direct optimization of per-voxel coefficients can rival neural networks. GeoSVR leverages these insights but redirects them from rendering speed to geometric fidelity, exploiting sparse voxels\u2019 topology to preserve coverage and enable localized surface refinement. In parallel, the rise of Gaussian Splatting delivered fast, high-quality rendering yet revealed structural limitations for watertightness and geometric clarity; this directly motivates GeoSVR\u2019s move away from point/ellipsoid primitives toward volumetric sparsity with stronger geometric priors. To ensure correct scene convergence, GeoSVR adapts DS-NeRF\u2019s principle of supervising with monocular depth while explicitly modeling uncertainty, grounding its voxel-uncertainty depth constraint in Kendall & Gal\u2019s heteroscedastic formulation to attenuate unreliable cues. Finally, large-scale, memory-efficient sparse volumetric structures\u2014pioneered by Voxel Hashing\u2014inform GeoSVR\u2019s practical design, enabling scalable storage and neighborhood-aware refinement within sparse voxel grids. Together, these works directly shape GeoSVR\u2019s key contribution: a sparse-voxel, uncertainty-regularized reconstruction pipeline that combines the completeness and locality of voxels with robust depth-driven constraints to achieve geometrically accurate surfaces.",
