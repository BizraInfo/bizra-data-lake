  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contributions\u2014necessary conditions that rule out tight generalization bounds for unstable algorithms, sufficient conditions ensuring tightness for loss-stable algorithms, and a final characterization via conditional variance of the algorithm\u2019s loss\u2014trace directly to three intertwined lines of work. First, Gastpar et al. (2023) provided the baseline framework for tightness over distribution families; the current paper extends that framework from problems to algorithms. Second, classical stability theory\u2014Bousquet and Elisseeff (2002) and Shalev-Shwartz et al. (2010)\u2014supplies both the conceptual and technical foundation: stability as the mechanism behind generalization, and its near-necessity for learnability. These ideas are sharpened here into algorithm-focused impossibility results (instability precludes tightness) and sufficiency results (loss-stability yields tightness). Hardt, Recht, and Singer (2016) operationalize stability for practical procedures like SGD, directly motivating the claim that commonly used, loss-stable algorithms fall on the \u201ctight-bounds\u201d side of the characterization. Third, variance-sensitive generalization techniques (Maurer and Pontil, 2009) and conditioning-on-algorithm viewpoints from information-theoretic bounds (Steinke and Zakynthinou, 2020) inspire the paper\u2019s culminating criterion that links tightness to the conditional variance of the algorithm\u2019s loss. Finally, the work is motivated by demonstrated gaps in uniform-convergence explanations (Nagarajan and Kolter, 2019), pushing toward precise conditions under which algorithm-dependent, distribution-aware bounds are tight\u2014or provably cannot be.",
