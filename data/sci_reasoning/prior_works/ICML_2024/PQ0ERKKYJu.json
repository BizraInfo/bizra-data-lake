  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014a principled case that satellite data constitutes a distinct machine learning modality\u2014rests on concrete evidence from benchmarks and methods that exposed persistent mismatches with standard computer vision practice. Foundational datasets such as BigEarthNet established large-scale, multispectral, multi-label classification and revealed the inadequacy of RGB/ImageNet-centric pipelines. SEN12MS further cemented the intrinsically multi-sensor character of Earth observation by aligning SAR and optical imagery, highlighting fusion and resolution issues that conventional vision overlooks. FMoW brought geodiversity and temporal revisits to the fore, making geographic and temporal distribution shifts unavoidable concerns. WILDS then formalized robustness under natural shifts (including FMoW-WILDS), pinpointing evaluation gaps that generic vision benchmarks do not capture and motivating SatML-specific robustness protocols.\nMethodologically, Seasonal Contrast demonstrated that satellite-aware self-supervised learning\u2014using temporal positives and physics-informed augmentations\u2014outperforms generic SSL, offering a concrete success that inspires the modality-specific stance. Challenge-led evidence from SpaceNet 6 showed that off-the-shelf detectors fail under clouds and varying acquisition conditions and that SAR\u2013optical fusion is necessary, underscoring unique sensing constraints. Finally, RemoteCLIP\u2019s domain-specialized vision\u2013language pretraining validated that general web-scale models underperform without RS-specific data and objectives, reinforcing the need for satellite-focused foundation models. Together, these works directly shaped the paper\u2019s argument that satellite data\u2019s sensing physics, multi-sensor structure, spatiotemporal dynamics, and deployment realities warrant a dedicated SatML research agenda.",
