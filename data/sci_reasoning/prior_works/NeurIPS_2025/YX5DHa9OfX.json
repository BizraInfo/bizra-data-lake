  "synthesis_narrative": "Pluralistic Stochastic Dominance (PSD) reframes imitation learning to ensure that an imitator supports the full diversity of demonstrated behaviors while outperforming or matching them under broad reward uncertainty. This reorientation grows from two converging lines of prior work. First, Bayesian IRL and Maximum Entropy IRL established principled ways to reason under reward uncertainty and to model expert behavior distributionally, but they typically enforce matching in expectation or via feature moments. GAIL further popularized expectation-driven occupancy matching, crystallizing a limitation: such objectives can collapse distinct modes of behavior. InfoGAIL showed one practical remedy\u2014introducing latent variables and mutual information to uncover multiple modes\u2014but without guarantees about reward-sensitive performance. The second line concerns learning and comparing full return distributions. Distributional RL introduced return-distribution modeling, providing the substrate on which PSD defines stochastic dominance criteria, thereby moving beyond expectations to order entire distributions across a set of candidate reward functions. To operationalize pluralistic support alignment, PSD leverages optimal transport. Building on Primal Wasserstein Imitation Learning\u2019s insight to align expert and learner samples with OT, PSD extends matching to trajectory pairs and focuses on policy support to preserve qualitative diversity. Finally, computationally, Sinkhorn\u2019s entropic OT enables scalable alignment across many trajectories, making PSD\u2019s dominance-based objective tractable. Together, these works directly shaped PSD\u2019s core contribution: a distributional, OT-grounded imitation objective that guarantees pluralistic behavior via stochastic dominance over uncertain rewards.",
