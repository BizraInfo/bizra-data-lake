  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014a unified, nonasymptotic theory of generalization for kernel regression across realistic regimes\u2014emerges from two converging lines of prior work. On the kernel side, Liang and Rakhlin\u2019s formulation of ridgeless kernel regression and excess risk in terms of eigenstructure provided the baseline analytic template, while Caponnetto\u2013De Vito established the classical rates for regularized kernel regression that any comprehensive theory must recover. El Karoui\u2019s high-dimensional spectral analysis of kernel random matrices directly inspired the present paper\u2019s key technical innovation: relative perturbation bounds for kernel eigenvalues tailored to realistic data distributions. These perturbation tools enable a single analysis to cover common kernels, interpolate between high- and fixed-dimensional regimes, and yield explicit rates in both ridgeless and regularized settings.\nOn the phenomenon side, Bartlett\u2013Long\u2013Lugosi\u2013Tsigler\u2019s theory of benign overfitting in linear regression, together with Hastie\u2013Montanari\u2013Rosset\u2013Tibshirani\u2019s characterization of ridgeless risk and dimensional effects, framed the central questions this paper answers for kernels\u2014showing benign overfitting in high dimensions and tempered behavior in fixed dimensions under realistic assumptions. Mei\u2013Montanari\u2019s precise asymptotics for kernels under Gaussian high-dimensional models highlighted the limitations of narrow setups; the current work addresses this gap by providing unified upper bounds that apply broadly. Finally, the NTK framework of Jacot\u2013Gabriel\u2013Hongler supplies the bridge from kernel regression to neural networks, allowing the new kernel bounds to translate into time-dependent generalization guarantees for networks trained in the kernel regime.",
