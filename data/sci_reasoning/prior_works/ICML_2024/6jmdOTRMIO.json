  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of Scalable AI Safety via Doubly-Efficient Debate is to turn the original debate proposal into protocols where an honest agent can prevail using only polynomial work, and to extend the guarantees to stochastic AI systems. The direct lineage starts with AI Safety via Debate (Irving et al., 2018), which formulated debate as a scalable oversight mechanism but relied on deterministic models and effectively exponential honest simulation; these are the explicit shortcomings the new paper resolves. The feasibility of using interaction to check complex reasoning is grounded in IP = PSPACE (Shamir, 1990), and operationalized via LFKN\u2019s algebraic methods and the sum-check protocol (1992), which compress exponential computations into polynomial-time interactive verification\u2014precisely the technical lever that removes the exponential burden on the honest debater. Building on this, GKR (2008) introduced doubly-efficient interactive proofs, making both prover and verifier efficient; the present work imports this efficiency ethos to debate, aiming for honest strategies with polynomial resources. RRR (2016) further refines these delegations to constant-round settings, guiding the design of bounded-round, practically efficient debates. Finally, MIP = NEXP-style results (Babai, Fortnow, Lund, 1991) reinforce that multiple powerful agents can certify very hard computations, a paradigm the paper adapts to adversarial AI agents, including handling stochasticity by aligning interactive proof techniques with randomized system behavior. Together, these works directly enable the paper\u2019s doubly-efficient, stochastic-capable debate protocols.",
