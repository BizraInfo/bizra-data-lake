  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper targets the minimax characterization of communication-constrained distributed estimation of multinomial distributions under \u2113^p losses and devises refinement-based protocols that achieve the optimal rates across regimes, revealing an elbow at p = 2. Its lower-bound machinery is rooted in strong data-processing inequalities and geometric arguments for distributed estimation (Polyanskiy\u2013Wu; Han\u2013\u00d6zg\u00fcr\u2013Weissman), which translate bit budgets into quantitative limits on achievable risk. On the algorithmic side, the protocol architecture follows a coarse-to-fine blueprint inspired by successive refinement in source coding (Equitz\u2013Cover): an initial sketch yields a rough estimate that adaptively guides later, more targeted communication. Concrete primitives for compressing distributional information\u2014random hashing and sketching\u2014trace to the streaming/sketching literature (Alon\u2013Matias\u2013Szegedy) and to communication-efficient protocols tailored for discrete distributions (Acharya\u2013Sun\u2013Zhang), which demonstrate how heavy hitters, hashing, and public randomness can be orchestrated under tight bit budgets. Finally, regime-aware estimation and thresholding techniques from functional estimation of discrete distributions (Jiao\u2013Venkat\u2013Han\u2013Weissman) inform how the protocol treats heavy versus rare symbols and balance bias-variance across \u2113^p risks, helping to explain and attain the distinct rates on either side of p = 2. Together, these works directly enable the paper\u2019s refinement methods, customized tools (successive refinement, sample compression, thresholding, hashing), and matching lower bounds that establish near-complete minimax optimality.",
