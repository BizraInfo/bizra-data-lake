  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation is to formalize imitation learning with supplementary, imperfect offline data and to provide theoretically justified algorithms that exploit it without harming performance. Ross et al. (2011) established that behavioral cloning suffers from covariate shift and error compounding, a phenomenon exacerbated when mixing expert and non-expert samples. This diagnosis is reinforced by Ben-David et al. (2010), whose domain adaptation bounds explain why empirical risk minimization on a mismatched source distribution can degrade target performance\u2014precisely the paper\u2019s finding that na\u00efvely pooling expert and supplementary data may underperform expert-only BC. To remedy this, the authors\u2019 approach draws on covariate-shift correction via importance-weighted ERM (Sugiyama et al., 2007), aligning optimization with the expert distribution rather than the mixture.\nMethodologically, GAIL (Ho & Ermon, 2016) reframed IL as distribution/occupancy matching, providing the distributional perspective that motivates correcting rather than averaging across disparate datasets. In the offline setting, ValueDICE (Kostrikov et al., 2020) demonstrated that off-policy imitation can be stabilized by estimating distribution ratios, directly inspiring weighting/filtering mechanisms that the paper adapts to heterogeneous-quality data. Finally, empirical precedents\u2014DQfD (Hester et al., 2018) and T-REX (Brown et al., 2019)\u2014show that suboptimal demonstrations can be helpful if incorporated with the right objective. The present work synthesizes these threads: it proves when and why na\u00efve combination fails, and introduces theoretically grounded weighting/selection algorithms that leverage cheap, suboptimal data to surpass pure BC while avoiding out-of-expert-distribution pitfalls.",
