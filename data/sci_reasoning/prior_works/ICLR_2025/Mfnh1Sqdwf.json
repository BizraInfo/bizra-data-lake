  "synthesis_narrative": "Long-range sequence-to-expression modeling established that distal regulatory DNA contributes to transcriptional output, with Enformer showing how wide receptive fields can predict gene expression from sequence while leaving the identity of causal regulatory elements implicit. ExPecto demonstrated a two-stage route, predicting epigenomic signals from sequence and then aggregating them to explain expression, but relied on fixed windows and a downstream linear model. The Activity-by-Contact framework articulated a causal view: enhancer \u2018activity\u2019 measured by epigenomic signals, coupled with regulatory linkage, drives gene expression, concretizing the notion of active regulatory elements as the mechanistic units of control. In parallel, the Deep Variational Information Bottleneck formalized how to retain only predictive information while discarding nuisances, and L2X showed that IB can be used to learn instance-wise sparse feature selectors. Complementing these, L0/Hard-Concrete regularization provided differentiable gates to sparsify contributions in neural networks. Meanwhile, practical discovery of regulatory elements often relied on MACS peak calling, which detects enrichment but not causality with respect to expression.\n\nTogether these strands expose a gap: sequence-to-expression models and peak callers do not directly learn causal regulatory elements, while IB-based selection offers a principled way to isolate informative subsets. Seq2Exp synthesizes these ideas by conditioning both sequence and epigenomic representations on latent active elements and applying an information bottleneck with Beta-distributed gates to combine their effects, filtering non-causal components. This unifies Enformer-like long-range sequence modeling with ExPecto\u2019s epigenomic mediation under an ABC-inspired causal definition of activity, yielding an end-to-end framework that discovers influential regulatory regions beyond enrichment-based peaks.",

Here, we introduce Seq2Exp, a Sequence to Expression network explicitly designed to discover and extract regulatory elements that drive target gene expression, enhancing the accuracy of the gene expression prediction. Our approach captures the causal relationship between epigenomic signals, DNA sequences and their associated regulatory elements. Specifically, we propose to decompose the epigenomic signals and the DNA sequence conditioned on the causal active regulatory elements, and apply an information bottleneck with the Beta distribution to combine their effects while filtering out non-causal components. Our experiments demonstrate that Seq2Exp outperforms existing baselines in gene expression prediction tasks and discovers influential regions compared to commonly used statistical methods for peak detection such as ",
