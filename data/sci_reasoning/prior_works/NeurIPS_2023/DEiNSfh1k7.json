  "synthesis_narrative": "DreamSim\u2019s core contribution\u2014building a holistic perceptual similarity metric using synthetic, text-to-image data and human judgments\u2014stands on two intertwined pillars: modern generative synthesis and feature-based perceptual metrics. On the generative side, latent diffusion (Stable Diffusion) and earlier text-guided diffusion models like GLIDE enabled the authors to programmatically construct image pairs that vary along specific dimensions (e.g., object color, pose, background) while holding others constant. This controllability was essential for creating a large dataset with clear, consensus human judgments that probe mid-level and semantic aspects beyond low-level distortions.\nOn the perceptual side, DreamSim directly extends the LPIPS tradition of learning from human judgments, but moves from patch-level distortions (as in BAPPS) to global, semantic differences. The foundational idea of comparing images in deep feature space traces to perceptual losses for style transfer and super-resolution, which established deep features as proxies for human perception. DreamSim updates this recipe with stronger, semantically aligned representations: CLIP offers concept-level alignment, while self-supervised ViT features from DINO bring object-centric, foreground-focused signals. Empirically, these modern embeddings better capture human holistic similarity than traditional low-level metrics, and their combination\u2014trained against the newly curated synthetic-judgment dataset\u2014yields a perceptual metric that aligns with how people compare images in terms of layout, pose, and content. Together, controllable diffusion-based synthesis and semantically rich feature backbones directly enable DreamSim\u2019s advancement.",
