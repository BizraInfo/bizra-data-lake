  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of SubTB(\u03bb) is to unify and control the bias\u2013variance tradeoff in GFlowNet training by learning from partial subtrajectories, directly mirroring TD(\u03bb)\u2019s \u03bb-returns. The foundational GFlowNet paper by Bengio et al. established the problem of training a sequential sampler for an unnormalized reward and introduced local conservation-based objectives, which are efficient but biased. Malkin et al.\u2019s Trajectory Balance (TB) then provided a full-trajectory objective with superior credit assignment but higher variance and slower convergence. Their broader foundations work explicitly articulated this tension between local (state/edge) and global (trajectory) objectives, setting up the exact gap SubTB(\u03bb) aims to close. Sutton\u2019s TD(\u03bb) contributed the central idea: interpolate between one-step and Monte Carlo targets using \u03bb to balance bias and variance. SubTB(\u03bb) transposes this principle to GFlowNets by enforcing subtrajectory-level consistency constraints and recovering TB at \u03bb=1 while approaching local updates as \u03bb\u21920. Empirical successes with \u03bb-weighted returns in RL, exemplified by Generalized Advantage Estimation, further motivate the practical benefits of a tunable \u03bb for stability and speed. Finally, PCL\u2019s multi-step path-consistency perspective situates TB\u2014and thus SubTB(\u03bb)\u2014within a lineage of trajectory-level consistency objectives, with SubTB(\u03bb) extending them to variable-length partial episodes tailored to GFlowNets.",
