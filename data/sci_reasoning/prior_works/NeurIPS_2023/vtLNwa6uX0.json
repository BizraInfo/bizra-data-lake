  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s central contribution\u2014recasting neural-network parameter spaces as Riemannian manifolds with explicit metrics to restore reparameterization invariance\u2014stands on two pillars: the information-geometric foundation and concrete pathologies in current practice. Amari\u2019s natural gradient formalized learning as steepest descent under the Fisher\u2013Rao metric, guaranteeing coordinate-invariant dynamics. Ollivier further specialized intrinsic, network-aware metrics, reinforcing that neural nets possess a natural geometry whose invariances should be respected. On the applied side, K-FAC operationalized metric-aware optimization and demonstrated partial invariance under affine layer reparameterizations, illustrating practical benefits of geometric reasoning.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Dinh et al. exposed that conventional, Euclidean-based quantities\u2014like sharpness\u2014are ill-posed under common reparameterizations, undermining claims that link flatness to generalization initiated by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber. The present work addresses this tension by showing that if one keeps the metric explicit and applies proper tensor transformation rules, curvature (Hessians), optimization trajectories, and even probabilistic modes become well-defined and invariant across parameterizations. This aligns with Girolami and Calderhead\u2019s insight that probabilistic inference requires a metric and associated volume element to achieve coordinate-invariant dynamics and sensible notions of density and modes. Finally, invariance-motivated optimization schemes such as Path-SGD exemplify how choosing an appropriate geometry mitigates reparameterization artifacts; the paper unifies these strands into a coherent Riemannian framework, clarifying when and how flatness, optimization, and Bayesian quantities should be measured in neural networks.",
