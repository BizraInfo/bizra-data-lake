  "synthesis_narrative": "Coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) established a single-shot acquisition model that compresses spectral cubes into a coded 2D measurement, setting the forward operator that reconstruction methods must invert. Deterministic physics-based solvers such as Generalized Alternating Projection (GAP) became fast baselines for SCI, but their TV-like priors often oversmooth fine textures and high-frequency spectral-spatial details. In hyperspectral representation, HySime showed that HS/MS data reside in a low-dimensional spectral subspace that can be estimated from the data, while unmixing theory formalized linear mixture factorization into spectra and abundances; together, these works provided a compact, physically meaningful embedding of spectra that can be inverted. On the generative side, Denoising Diffusion Restoration Models proved that pretrained diffusion models can be adapted to linear inverse problems by enforcing measurement consistency, and Diffusion Posterior Sampling generalized posterior-guided sampling using the known forward operator. Complementarily, Palette illustrated that conditional, coarse-to-fine diffusion can inject high-frequency details starting from a lightweight predictor\u2019s rough estimate.\nCollectively, these insights suggested a path: map the high-dimensional MSI into a low-dimensional, reversible spectral subspace where powerful pretrained RGB diffusion priors are applicable, use a fast physics-based predictor for an initial estimate, and perform physics-guided diffusion refinement focused on recovering lost high frequencies. PSR-SCI naturalizes this synthesis by unmixing-driven spectral embedding to bridge MSIs with RGB diffusion, and by integrating SCI measurement consistency during sampling to overcome data scarcity and computational burdens of training MSI-specific diffusion models.",

    "abstract": "Spectral Compressive Imaging (SCI) reconstruction is inherently ill-posed because a single observation admits multiple plausible reconstructions. Traditional deterministic methods struggle to effectively recover high-frequency details. Although diffusion models offer promising solutions to this challenge, their application is constrained by the limited training data and high computational demands associated with multispectral images (MSIs), making direct diffusion training impractical. To address these issues, we propose a novel Predict-and-unmixing-driven-Subspace-Refine framework (PSR-SCI). This framework begins with a light-weight predictor that produces an initial, rough estimate of the MSI. Subsequently, we introduce a unmixing-driven reversible spectral embedding module that decomposes the MSI into subspace images and spectral coefficients. This compact representation facilitates the adaptation of pre-trained RGB diffusion models and focuses refinement processes on high-frequency",
