  "synthesis_narrative": "The core of Fast Timing-Conditioned Latent Audio Diffusion fuses two decisive lines of prior work: latent diffusion and fully convolutional audio autoencoding. Rombach et al.\u2019s latent diffusion framework is the architectural foundation, enabling compute-efficient generation by operating in a compressed latent space. AudioLDM then brought this idea to text-to-audio, demonstrating that CLAP-conditioned diffusion in an audio latent can yield strong text coherence\u2014but largely at 16 kHz, mono, and fixed lengths. The present work directly extends that design by introducing timing embeddings to control duration and by upgrading the latent path to 44.1 kHz stereo with a fully convolutional VAE, taking inspiration from RAVE\u2019s fully convolutional variational autoencoder to support variable-length inputs and fast decoding.\n\nA parallel track of discrete-token codecs (e.g., EnCodec) underpins baselines like MusicGen and AudioGen, but these pipelines typically require autoregressive decoding and struggle with fast, long, high-fidelity stereo; these limitations explicitly motivate the paper\u2019s choice of a continuous, fully convolutional latent. MusicLM crystallized the goal of coherent, long-form text-to-music generation, yet relies on heavy multi-stage token modeling and doesn\u2019t emphasize fast stereo rendering. By combining CLAP-style text conditioning with novel timing embeddings within a latent diffusion setup, the paper directly addresses these gaps\u2014achieving efficient, controllable, long-form 44.1 kHz stereo generation that produces music with structure and spatialized sound.",
