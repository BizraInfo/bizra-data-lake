  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of this paper builds squarely on the ray-based formulation of hard-label attacks introduced by OPT (Cheng et al., 2019), which turns decision-only attacks into a continuous optimization problem g(\u03b8) given by the distance to the adversarial region along a ray, measured via binary search. Sign-OPT (Cheng et al., 2020) then provided the key practical tool\u2014the sign-based gradient estimator for g(\u03b8)\u2014that made this formulation query-efficient; the present work directly interrogates that estimator\u2019s quality and replaces it with a theoretically grounded, prior-guided alternative. Parallel advances in decision-based attacks, notably HSJA, reinforced binary search for boundary evaluation and efficient decision-only gradient estimation, practices that underpin how g(\u03b8) is evaluated here. RayS further cemented ray searching as a strong baseline for hard-label attacks, highlighting that the efficiency bottleneck lies in how directions are chosen and updated\u2014precisely the locus of this paper\u2019s improvement. The conceptual leap comes from the line of work on priors for black-box gradient estimation: Bandits with Priors (Ilyas et al., 2019) showed that injecting structured priors dramatically reduces estimator variance, while P-RGF (Guo et al., 2020) demonstrated that surrogate-model gradients can be used as transfer-based priors within random gradient-free methods. The present paper directly extends these insights to the hard-label ray objective, proposing a projection-based integration of surrogate priors into the gradient estimator, thereby improving ray search efficiency both theoretically and empirically.",
