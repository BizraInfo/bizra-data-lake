  "synthesis_narrative": "CyberHost emerges at the intersection of three maturing threads: audio-to-motion, human-structured conditioning, and one-stage video diffusion. Early audio-driven works such as Ginosar et al. established the core mapping from speech to co-speech gestures, and Wav2Lip crystallized the requirement for precise audio\u2013mouth alignment. However, these either stop at skeletal motion or are portrait-only, leaving full-body realism and hands unaddressed. In parallel, diffusion-based video generation matured with AnimateDiff\u2019s motion modules, providing a practical one-stage backbone for temporally coherent video synthesis. Conditioning mechanisms like ControlNet, together with dense human priors exemplified by DensePose, showed that injecting structural signals can stabilize human layout, yet prior pipelines largely remained video- or pose-driven. Audio-driven diffusion for portraits (e.g., EMO) then demonstrated that direct audio conditioning can replace two-stage designs, but it did not solve the harder half-body case with hand integrity and global identity consistency. CyberHost synthesizes these lines: it adopts a one-stage video diffusion backbone, extends ControlNet-style conditioning with richer human priors (including hand-centric cues) to address structural failures, and introduces a Region Attention Module that blends learnable identity-agnostic latents with identity-specific local features to improve critical regions. The result explicitly tackles the gaps of two-stage head-only systems while operationalizing dense human priors within a unified audio-driven generator.",
