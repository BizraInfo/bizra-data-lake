  "synthesis_narrative": "ThinK targets the high memory footprint of KV caches in long-context LLM inference by pruning along the channel dimension in a query-dependent way designed to minimize attention-weight loss. Its lineage connects directly to prior work on KV cache pruning and importance-based retention, theoretical insights on attention\u2019s low-rank structure, and empirical observations about uneven channel magnitudes in LLMs. Scissorhands is the most immediate antecedent, proving that aggressive KV cache pruning can preserve accuracy; ThinK advances this line by moving from token/head structures to a finer, channel-level pruning guided by the current query\u2019s needs. H2O\u2019s heavy-hitter oracle and StreamingLLM\u2019s attention-sink mechanism establish the broader paradigm of importance-driven KV retention under memory pressure; ThinK inherits this principle but applies it within the representation space (channels) rather than across tokens. Linformer provides the low-rank lens that justifies why many channel directions contribute little to attention, making principled pruning feasible. Meanwhile, SmoothQuant (and related activation quantization works) reveal heavy-tailed, uneven per-channel magnitudes in LLMs\u2014an empirical property ThinK exploits to identify low-impact channels. Finally, head-pruning evidence from Michel et al. underscores systemic redundancy in Transformer attention, motivating ThinK\u2019s structured, query-aware channel pruning that achieves significant KV memory savings (>20%) without accuracy loss.",
