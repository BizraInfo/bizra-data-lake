  "synthesis_narrative": "ST-TTC\u2019s core idea\u2014performing lightweight, real-time bias correction at inference by operating in the spectral domain and updating only a minimal set of parameters\u2014sits at the intersection of test-time adaptation, time-series shift correction, and frequency-aware forecasting. Tent and TTT provide the foundational blueprint for label-free adaptation at test time: limit updates to a small module and drive them with unsupervised or auxiliary objectives to ensure stability, speed, and generality. RevIN translates this paradigm to time-series forecasting, proving that simple, per-instance corrections can substantially reduce the impact of distribution shifts without retraining, thereby validating the value of a plug-in \u201ccalibrator\u201d that adjusts predictions online.\nOn the modeling side, Autoformer and TimesNet foreground the centrality of periodic structure and phase in long-horizon forecasting\u2014insights that directly motivate ST-TTC\u2019s choice to calibrate in the frequency domain, where periodic biases are compact and interpretable. FDA contributes the key mechanism: modulating amplitude (and respecting phase) in Fourier space to bridge domain gaps, which ST-TTC adapts into a phase\u2013amplitude modulation calibrator that mitigates periodic shifts specific to spatio-temporal data. Finally, LoRA informs the engineering of the flash updating mechanism, showing how parameter-efficient, low-rank updates can deliver fast, low-compute adaptation. Together, these works shape ST-TTC into a test-time computing framework that is model-agnostic, computation-conscious, and explicitly targeted at correcting non-stationary, periodic biases that undermine spatio-temporal forecasts.",
