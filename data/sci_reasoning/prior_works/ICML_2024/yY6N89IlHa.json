  "synthesis_narrative": "CLIF\u2019s core contribution\u2014a LIF-variant that creates complementary backpropagation paths to strengthen temporal gradients while preserving binary spikes\u2014sits squarely in the lineage of direct SNN training with surrogate gradients. The foundational bedrock comes from SuperSpike, SLAYER, and STBP, which established how to apply BPTT to LIF neurons using surrogate spike derivatives and temporal error propagation. Within that paradigm, CLIF identifies a concrete failure mode: temporal gradients vanish across time steps in standard LIF-based training. Recent works such as TET and Dspike explicitly targeted this issue, respectively via temporal loss reweighting and sharper (discontinuous) surrogates. CLIF addresses the same gap, but at the neuron-design level\u2014altering dynamics to open extra temporal gradient pathways\u2014thereby improving credit assignment without changing the training objective or sacrificing discrete spiking. The inspiration to endow neurons with additional internal dynamics that aid temporal learning traces to ALIF, where an auxiliary adaptive threshold state extends memory. CLIF similarly augments LIF with a complementary pathway, but keeps the design simple, hyperparameter-free, and compatible with standard surrogate gradients. Finally, prior neuron-centric optimization like Parametric LIF demonstrated that modifying intrinsic dynamics can materially improve trainability; CLIF advances this trajectory by specifically engineering the neuron's dynamics to mitigate temporal gradient decay, yielding consistent accuracy gains across datasets while maintaining SNN efficiency.",
