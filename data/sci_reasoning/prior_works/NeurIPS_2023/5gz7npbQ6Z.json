  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014identifying the causal effect in a linear SCM with a single proxy by exploiting cross-moments under non-Gaussian latent confounding\u2014sits at the intersection of proxy-variable identification and non-Gaussian causal discovery. On the proxy side, Miao\u2013Geng\u2013Tchetgen Tchetgen and Kuroki\u2013Pearl formalized how auxiliary variables (negative controls/surrogates) can restore identifiability, but typically require two proxies with conditional independence or bridge conditions. This NeurIPS paper directly advances that line by showing that, when the latent confounder is non-Gaussian, cross-moments of treatment, outcome, and a single proxy suffice for identification.\nNon-Gaussianity as an identification lever traces to LiNGAM and, more fundamentally, Reiers\u00f8l\u2019s identifiability results for errors-in-variables with non-normal disturbances. These works justify the paper\u2019s reliance on higher-order moments and the idea that Gaussianity is a knife-edge case where such moment-based identification fails. Methodologically, the approach aligns with Lewbel\u2019s heteroskedasticity-based identification: both exploit higher-order/cross-moment structure to overcome endogeneity without external instruments. Finally, the paper positions itself against Difference-in-Differences, whose semiparametric foundations (Abadie) elucidate the parallel-trends/equal-effect requirement; the authors show DiD emerges as a special unbiased case, whereas their cross-moment estimator remains valid more broadly under non-Gaussian confounding. Together, these threads crystallize into a single-proxy, cross-moment identification strategy that generalizes negative control ideas beyond their traditional two-proxy requirements.",
