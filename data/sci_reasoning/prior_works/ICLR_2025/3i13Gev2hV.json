  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation\u2014compositional entailment learning in a hyperbolic vision\u2013language space\u2014emerges from unifying asymmetric semantic order with hierarchical geometry and modern contrastive pretraining. CLIP established the dominant pairwise contrastive formulation for aligning images and texts, but its symmetric Euclidean similarity overlooks the inherently hierarchical and directional nature of visual\u2013linguistic concepts. Poincar\u00e9 Embeddings introduced hyperbolic geometry as a principled space for low-distortion hierarchical representation, laying the geometric foundation this work adopts. Building on that, Hyperbolic Entailment Cones provided a concrete mechanism for modeling asymmetric entailment as directional constraints in hyperbolic space; this idea is extended here to multi-granular compositions (object boxes to images, nouns to captions). Order-Embeddings of Images and Language first brought asymmetric order to cross-modal learning, directly inspiring the move from similarity to entailment objectives that this paper generalizes to hyperbolic geometry and composes across parts and wholes. On the data side, ViLD demonstrated how language supervision can induce region-level signals but lacked explicit hierarchical entailment, motivating the present method\u2019s shift to directional, hyperbolic composition. Finally, Grounding DINO supplies robust phrase grounding, making it feasible to automatically extract noun\u2013box alignments that instantiate the hierarchical scaffolding required by the proposed hyperbolic entailment training. Together, these works directly converge to enable a hyperbolic, composition-aware entailment framework for vision\u2013language representation learning.",
