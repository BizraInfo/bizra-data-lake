  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014a log-sum-ReLU (LSR) energy for Dense Associative Memory (DenseAM) derived from the Epanechnikov kernel\u2014sits at the intersection of associative memory energies and kernel density estimation (KDE). Hopfield\u2019s original energy-based formulation (1982) provides the dynamical systems substrate: attractor-based retrieval from an explicit energy function. Krotov and Hopfield\u2019s DenseAM (2016) demonstrated that choosing the separation (activation) function within this energy critically controls capacity and the shape of the attractor landscape; their subsequent analysis (2018) tied these choices to robustness and the emergence of non-trivial or spurious minima. Modern Hopfield Networks (Ramsauer et al., 2020) crystallized the community\u2019s default energy as log-sum-exponential (LSE), proving exponential capacity and connecting retrieval to attention mechanisms; this became the de facto baseline for high-capacity associative memories.\nDrawing from KDE, Parzen (1962) formalized density estimation as a sum over kernel contributions, and Epanechnikov (1969) identified the Epanechnikov kernel as MSE-optimal. The present work fuses these threads: it replaces LSE with a KDE-inspired log-sum over Epanechnikov-shaped contributions, operationalized via ReLU, to obtain an LSR energy. This swap preserves exact retrieval and exponential capacity without relying on explicitly exponential separation functions, while predictably reshaping the energy surface to produce abundant additional local minima. In doing so, the paper extends DenseAM design beyond exponential/softmax energies to a principled, optimal-kernel alternative that supports both massive storage and generative \u201ccreative\u201d attractors with competitive likelihoods.",
