  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s intellectual lineage begins with Dasgupta\u2019s 2016 formulation, which defined the cost-based objective and rigorous benchmark for hierarchical clustering that this work adopts wholesale. Subsequent non-private algorithmic progress\u2014exemplified by Cohen-Addad et al. (2018) and Moseley & Wang (2017)\u2014established approximation strategies and baseline performance for the Dasgupta objective and related hierarchical clustering criteria; these methods provide the concrete algorithmic templates the present paper adapts and analyzes under privacy constraints. On the privacy side, Dwork et al. (2006) furnished the sensitivity-based noise calibration principles that dictate the additive-error scaling in private optimization, while Hardt & Talwar (2010) supplied general lower-bound machinery that the authors leverage to prove \u2126(|V|^2/\u03b5) unavoidable error for any \u03b5-DP algorithm in this setting. To match these limits algorithmically, the paper directly applies the exponential mechanism of McSherry & Talwar (2007), yielding an exponential-time \u03b5-DP procedure attaining the optimal additive error. Finally, for the stochastic block model regime, Abbe, Bandeira, and Hall (2016) provide the separation conditions and exact-recovery guarantees that the authors translate into the private domain, showing that\u2014with suitable separation\u2014the proposed \u03b5-DP algorithm achieves 1+o(1) approximation and exact block recovery. Together, these works directly shape the problem formulation, lower-bound methodology, algorithmic constructions, and SBM recovery guarantees that constitute the core contributions.",
