  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of this paper\u2014defining a k-multilinear extension and building unified Frank\u2013Wolfe/continuous-greedy frameworks for constrained k-submodular maximization\u2014sits at the intersection of two lines of work. On the discrete side, Huber and Kolmogorov introduced k-submodularity and its domain, and Ward\u2013\u017divn\u00fd (followed by Iwata\u2013Tanigawa\u2013Yoshida) established the maximization problem and tight constant-factor algorithms, largely with combinatorial techniques. These works clarified the objective but left a conspicuous gap: the lack of a continuous relaxation analogous to the submodular multilinear extension, and weaker ratios for constrained cases (e.g., knapsack and matroid). On the continuous-optimization side, Vondr\u00e1k\u2019s submodular welfare result and Calinescu\u2013Chekuri\u2013P\u00e1l\u2013Vondr\u00e1k\u2019s matroid work crystallized the multilinear extension and continuous greedy (Frank\u2013Wolfe\u2013style) ascent on product-of-simplices domains, while Feldman\u2013Naor\u2013Schwartz extended this methodology to non-monotone functions; Chekuri\u2013Vondr\u00e1k\u2013Zenklusen then provided contention-resolution schemes to convert fractional solutions into feasible discrete ones under broad constraints. The present paper directly generalizes this continuous toolkit to the k-submodular domain by introducing a principled k-multilinear extension and proving key linearity/monotonicity properties that permit Frank\u2013Wolfe\u2013type updates and rounding under knapsack and matroid constraints. This design both explains and enables the step from prior 1/3 and 0.245 guarantees to 1/2 and 1/3, respectively, by importing the strongest multilinear-extension analyses into the previously discrete-only k-submodular setting.",
