  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014a signal-and-noise framework for evaluating language model benchmarks and guiding small-scale decision-making\u2014builds on three converging lines of work. First, scaling-law studies (Kaplan et al., Hoffmann et al.) demonstrated that model performance can be predictably extrapolated when measured with stable, information-rich metrics (e.g., loss), foregrounding the importance of evaluations that minimize measurement noise. Second, critiques of apparent discontinuities and \u2018emergent\u2019 abilities (Schaeffer et al.) showed how metric choice and aggregation can fabricate sharp thresholds, motivating the authors to formalize \u2018signal\u2019 as the ability to separate better from worse models and to recommend metrics/interventions that avoid thresholding artifacts and improve extrapolation accuracy. Third, reproducibility and evaluation frameworks in NLP (Mosbach et al.; Dodge et al.; HELM) documented substantial variance across seeds, training steps, and setups, and promoted error bars and principled reporting\u2014evidence that directly inspires the paper\u2019s definition of \u2018noise\u2019 as sensitivity to random variability and its emphasis on actionable interventions. Finally, large multi-task suites (BIG-bench) revealed heterogeneous task difficulty and scale-dependent behavior, underscoring the need for a principled way to assess which benchmarks truly discriminate among models (signal) and which are dominated by randomness (noise). Together, these works point to a clear gap: existing multi-task evaluations lack an explicit SNR lens. The present paper fills that gap by quantifying signal and noise, linking them to decision reliability and scaling-law prediction error, and prescribing concrete benchmark design changes to improve both.",
