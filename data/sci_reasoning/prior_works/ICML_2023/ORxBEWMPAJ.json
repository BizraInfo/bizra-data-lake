  "synthesis_narrative": "JAWS-X sits at the intersection of conformal prediction\u2019s distribution-free guarantees and the realities of data collected under shift and feedback. The conformal framework of Vovk, Gammerman, and Shafer (2005) provides the core validity principle and exchangeability assumption that this work seeks to relax. Split conformal prediction (Lei et al., 2018) made these guarantees practical but at the cost of label efficiency, using only a calibration split\u2014an inefficiency that JAWS-X explicitly addresses. The jackknife+ (Barber et al., 2021) showed how to recover label efficiency with rigorous finite-sample coverage via leave-one-out refits; JAWS-FCS takes this as its baseline and extends its guarantees to a non-exchangeable regime with feedback dependencies, while JAWS-X introduces computationally tractable relaxations that preserve coverage.\n\nOn the shift side, Shimodaira (2000) established the covariate shift paradigm and importance weighting, laying the foundation for weighted calibration. Building directly on this, Tibshirani et al. (2019) formulated conformal prediction under standard covariate shift through importance-weighted calibration; JAWS-X adopts this formulation and integrates it with jackknife+-style reuse of labels to overcome the trade-off between computational and statistical efficiency. Finally, Bottou et al. (2013) articulated how deployed policies create feedback-induced selection bias, motivating the feedback covariate shift setting addressed by JAW-FCS. Together, these works directly shape JAWS-X\u2019s key contribution: computationally practical, finite-sample valid predictive intervals under both standard and feedback covariate shift.",
