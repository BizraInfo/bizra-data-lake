  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014goal-conditioned exploiters and explicit opponent modeling within a StarCraft II league\u2014arises at the intersection of game-theoretic population training and representation learning for opponent behavior. AlphaStar introduced the practical league framework for full-game StarCraft II, operationalizing game-theoretic ideas with main agents and exploiters, but relied on unconditioned exploiters and limited online opponent awareness. PSRO formalized populations, best responses, and meta-strategies; NFSP further established training against population mixtures via average policies and best-response components. Building on these, the paper replaces many narrowly specialized exploiters with a single goal-conditioned exploiter, a natural application of UVFA that conditions a shared policy on exploitation targets (opponents/strategic goals), thereby approximating multiple best responses more efficiently.\nConcurrently, the work augments league agents with opponent modeling to enhance in-game responsiveness. DRON provides the template of conditioning an agent on an inferred opponent representation, while ToMnet offers a general approach for learning latent, predictive embeddings of an opponent\u2019s strategy from behavioral traces. Inspired by LOLA\u2019s emphasis on anticipating opponent adaptation, the paper designs agents to be responsive to evolving opponent strategies during play. Together, these strands yield a league that both covers opponent-specific weaknesses through conditional best responses and adapts online via opponent inference, delivering improved robustness and superhuman performance with far less compute than AlphaStar.",
