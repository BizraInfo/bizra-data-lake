  "synthesis_narrative": "EF-3DGS fuses two threads: real-time radiance field rendering with 3D Gaussian Splatting and the motion-centric sensing of event cameras. Kerbl et al.\u2019s 3DGS provides the core representation and fast optimization loop that EF-3DGS augments with event-based supervision. From the event vision side, Gallego et al.\u2019s contrast maximization (CMax) framework gives a principled way to extract motion information by warping events to maximize contrast, which EF-3DGS leverages to stabilize pose estimation under high-speed motion. ESIM formalizes the standard event generation model (log-intensity thresholding), furnishing the measurement model EF-3DGS differentiates through in its Event Generation Model (EGM) to fuse frames and events and enable supervision in the inter-frame intervals.\n\nRecent event\u2013radiance-field works such as E2NeRF show how to render or supervise radiance fields from events via differentiable event generation, directly inspiring EF-3DGS\u2019s event-aided losses while it adopts the Gaussian splat primitive for efficiency. Handling free trajectories builds on the broader idea of joint pose\u2013scene optimization from BARF, which EF-3DGS adapts to the splatting regime and enriches with event constraints. Finally, SplaTAM demonstrates how Gaussian splats can underpin tracking and mapping, while Ultimate SLAM highlights the practical advantage of fusing events with frames for robust motion in high-speed scenarios. EF-3DGS synthesizes these contributions into a unified system that uses EGM for continuous supervision and CMax-driven motion cues to achieve robust, event-aided 3DGS reconstruction under fast, unconstrained camera motion.",
