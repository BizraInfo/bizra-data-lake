  "synthesis_narrative": "This paper advances the learning-augmented algorithms paradigm by replacing coarse, global trust parameters with calibrated, per-instance guidance. The foundational shift is rooted in the robustness\u2013consistency framework of Lykouris and Vassilvitskii, which formalized how to exploit predictions without sacrificing worst-case guarantees. Purohit\u2013Svitkina\u2013Kumar\u2019s treatment of ski rental with predictions provided a canonical template for prediction-dependent competitive analysis, while Wei and Wajc exposed fundamental trade-offs that motivate more nuanced uncertainty quantification than aggregate error bounds. The calibration literature supplies that nuance: Guo et al. revealed that modern predictors are often miscalibrated and popularized practical post-hoc fixes, and Zadrozny\u2013Elkan established classical calibration tools that can transform raw scores into reliable probabilities. Building on these, the paper operationalizes calibrated outputs as actionable advice levels for online decisions, showing theoretically that in high-variance regimes calibrated information guides choices more effectively than alternative uncertainty quantification proxies. In the job scheduling case study, prior learning-augmented scheduling results (e.g., Im\u2013Moseley\u2013Pruhs\u2013Stein) demonstrate how predictions can improve flow time or makespan under robustness constraints; this work strengthens that narrative by showing that calibrated predictors unlock stronger, prediction-dependent performance improvements. Collectively, these strands directly inform the paper\u2019s core contribution: a principled bridge between ML-generated uncertainty and online decision-making that achieves near-optimal, fine-grained performance guarantees.",
