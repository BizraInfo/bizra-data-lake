  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014Stochastic Control Guidance (SCG) for training-free, non-differentiable rule guidance\u2014emerges from unifying guided diffusion with sampling-based stochastic optimal control. Prior guided diffusion methods defined the problem but left a critical gap: Dhariwal and Nichol\u2019s classifier guidance and Ho and Salimans\u2019 classifier-free guidance both hinge on differentiable signals (either a classifier or conditional model gradients), making them ill-suited for symbolic musical rules that are naturally non-differentiable. Diffuser reframed diffusion as trajectory generation under rewards, suggesting a control-theoretic lens, but it still relied on gradient-based shaping of the denoising process.\nSCG draws its mechanism directly from path-integral and entropy-regularized control. Theodorou et al.\u2019s path-integral policy improvement shows how to steer distributions using reward-weighted sampling with only forward evaluations, while Todorov\u2019s linearly solvable MDPs formalize exponentiated-reward weighting as the foundation of control-as-inference. SCG instantiates these ideas inside each reverse-diffusion step, reweighting samples by rule-derived scores without differentiating through the rules or the generator\u2014thereby delivering the first training-free guidance for non-differentiable musical constraints. Complementing SCG, the paper\u2019s latent diffusion architecture for symbolic music directly builds on Rombach et al.\u2019s latent diffusion principle, enabling high time-resolution piano-roll generation that can be modularly combined with SCG. Together, these works form the direct lineage that enables non-differentiable rule-guided, plug-and-play symbolic music generation.",
