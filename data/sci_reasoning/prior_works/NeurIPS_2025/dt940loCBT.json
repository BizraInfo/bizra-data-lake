  "synthesis_narrative": "SafeVLA\u2019s key contribution\u2014safety alignment of vision-language-action policies via constrained learning\u2014sits at the intersection of CMDP-based safe RL, adversarial risk elicitation, and modern VLA architectures. Altman\u2019s CMDP formalism provides the foundational lens to treat safety as explicit cost constraints, enabling principled optimization over safety\u2013performance trade-offs. Building on this, Constrained Policy Optimization offers a practical primal\u2013dual route to enforce constraints during policy improvement; SafeVLA adapts this machinery to high-capacity VLA policies. To proactively surface and reduce safety risks, the method adopts a min\u2013max stance reminiscent of Robust Adversarial RL, where adversarially generated hazards or prompts elicit failure modes that guide robustification. Complementing this, ideas from shielding inform SafeVLA\u2019s explicit safety requirement modeling and constraint enforcement, structuring what constitutes a violation and how to guard against it. Safety Gym shapes evaluation and cost accounting, standardizing how cumulative safety costs are measured and compared against task performance. Finally, RT-2 anchors the application domain by defining the VLA policy class that maps multimodal inputs to actions, while automated red teaming for LLMs motivates SafeVLA\u2019s active elicitation of unsafe behaviors to drive targeted constrained optimization. Together, these threads directly converge in SafeVLA\u2019s Integrated Safety Approach: model risks, elicit failures, constrain via CMDPs, and assure through focused evaluation.",
