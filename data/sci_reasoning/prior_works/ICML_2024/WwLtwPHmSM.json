  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of this paper\u2014fixed-budget best-arm identification (BAI) under Stochastic Rising Bandits (SRBs)\u2014sits at the intersection of two strands: the SRB modeling of pull-dependent means and the classical BAI algorithms and analyses. On the BAI side, the seminal work of Audibert and Bubeck (2010) introduced the fixed-budget algorithms UCBE and Successive Rejects (SR). The present paper directly extends these designs to the SRB setting: R-UCBE and R-SR retain the UCBE/SR allocation and stagewise rejection mechanics but modify confidence radii and gap surrogates to reflect that expected rewards increase with pulls. The broader pure-exploration framework and error-probability guarantees trace back to Bubeck, Munos, and Stoltz (2009), whose formulation underpins the fixed-budget objective pursued here. Further, insights from Karnin, Koren, and Somekh (2013) and Kaufmann, Capp\u00e9, and Garivier (2016) on instance-dependent hardness and change-of-measure analyses inform how the paper calibrates budgets and interprets complexity in a non-i.i.d., pull-dependent environment. On the modeling side, the SRB framework was established in prior work by the same authors (Mussi et al., 2023), but only for regret minimization. That paper explicitly left pure exploration in SRBs open, motivating the present contribution. In short, the current paper\u2019s algorithms are rising-aware extensions of UCBE/SR, and its guarantees adapt classical BAI principles to the SRB model introduced in earlier SRB work, thereby closing the identified gap.",
