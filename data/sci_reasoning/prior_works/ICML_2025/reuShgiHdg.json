  "synthesis_narrative": "ReferSplat\u2019s core innovation\u2014referring segmentation directly over 3D Gaussian splats with explicit spatial-relation reasoning\u2014emerges from two converging threads. First, Kerbl et al.\u2019s 3D Gaussian Splatting establishes the foundational point-based radiance representation that ReferSplat both optimizes and segments; without 3DGS, the paper\u2019s notion of assigning and reasoning over language features at the Gaussian primitive level would not stand. Second, the language-embedded 3D idea crystallized by LERF shows how to imbue a 3D radiance representation with open-vocabulary semantics, but its NeRF backbone and visibility-centric matching limit practical reasoning about occluded objects and relational descriptions\u2014gaps ReferSplat explicitly targets and for which Ref-LERF provides tailored data.\nWithin the Gaussian family, LangSplat and OpenGaussian are the most direct precursors, attaching vision\u2013language features to splats to enable text queries. ReferSplat positions these as primary baselines and extends them by introducing spatially aware language\u20133D modeling that reasons across neighborhoods of splats and inter-object layouts, thereby handling occlusions and language with relational cues. Complementing this, Panoptic Gaussian Splatting demonstrates semantic labeling in Gaussians but within a closed vocabulary, underscoring the need for open-vocabulary referring abilities that ReferSplat delivers.\nFinally, the problem formulation and key insight that relational reasoning is central to 3D language grounding trace to ScanRefer and 3DVG-Transformer. ReferSplat internalizes these lessons in a Gaussian setting, upgrading from object localization to fine-grained segmentation while preserving the relational grounding essential for real-world, language-driven 3D understanding.",
