  "synthesis_narrative": "Autoregressive co-kriging established a principled way to couple low- and high-fidelity simulators, letting fast approximations inform expensive predictions through a Gaussian-process hierarchy. Subsequent multi-fidelity GP regression refinements clarified how to model cross-fidelity correlations and propagate uncertainty coherently across inputs and fidelities. In parallel, Conditional Neural Processes showed how to meta-learn task-specific function priors from context sets, enabling fast adaptation to new tasks by conditioning on small, noisy observations. Deep kernel learning demonstrated that neural representations can be fused with GP inference to encode rich inductive biases while retaining calibrated uncertainty. In reliability-based design, EGRA crystallized the objective of optimizing designs by minimizing failure (rare-event) probabilities using kriging surrogates, while classical variance-reduction strategies such as Subset Simulation and active-learning schemes like AK\u2011MCS highlighted the practical difficulty of estimating very small probabilities without prohibitive numbers of high-fidelity simulations.\nThese strands collectively exposed an opportunity: combine multi-fidelity surrogates that reduce cost with meta-learned priors that inject domain knowledge, specifically for design objectives defined by tiny probabilities. The natural next step is to condition a GP-based multi-fidelity surrogate on a neural prior learned from auxiliary simulations, so the model generalizes across designs and fidelities while remaining uncertainty-aware in the rare-event tail. By aligning CNP-conditioned priors with co-kriging structure, one can target reliability-style objectives with far fewer high-fidelity evaluations, directly addressing the data inefficiency that limits EGRA, Subset Simulation, and AK\u2011MCS in extreme rare-event regimes.",

    "abstract": "The experimental discovery of neutrinoless double-beta decay (NLDBD) would answer one of the most important questions in physics: Why is there more matter than antimatter in our universe? To maximize the chances of discovery, NLDBD experiments must optimize their detector designs to minimize the probability of background events contaminating the detector. Given that this probability is inherently low, design optimization either requires extremely costly simulations to generate sufficient background counts or contending with significant variance. In this work, we formalize this dilemma as a Rare Event Design (RED) problem: identifying optimal design parameters when the design metric to be minimized is inherently small. We then designed the Rare Event Surrogate Model (RESuM) for physics detector design optimization under RED conditions. RESuM uses a pre-trained Conditional Neural Process (CNP) model to incorporate additional prior knowledge into a Multi-Fidelity Gaussian Process model. W",
