  "synthesis_narrative": "The core of S2P2 is a synthesis of Hawkes-style event-driven dynamics with modern deep state-space modeling and efficient scan-based computation. The classical Hawkes process (Hawkes, 1971) provides the key inductive bias\u2014latent states that decay between events and jump at event times\u2014which S2P2 preserves while removing linearity constraints via nonlinear state-space parameterizations. Early neural MTPP work (Du et al., 2016) established the baseline of learning intensities from data with RNNs, but their discrete-time recurrences under-capture continuous inter-event evolution. Neural Hawkes (Mei & Eisner, 2017) moved closer to the Hawkes inductive bias with decaying hidden states; S2P2 directly extends this idea by casting the hidden dynamics as a deep SSM with jump SDE updates and a nonlinear readout for intensities. To realize scalability, S2P2 adopts the structured state-space framework (Gu et al., 2022), using its parallel scan for linear recurrences to achieve linear-time training and sublinear scaling, something attention-based Hawkes variants like the Transformer Hawkes Process (Zuo et al., 2020) struggle with due to quadratic complexity and weaker continuous-time priors. Finally, the jump SDE machinery (Norcliffe et al., 2020) provides a principled way to interleave continuous dynamics with stochastic jumps at events; S2P2 adapts this to directly model marked event intensities. Together, these works form the direct lineage enabling S2P2\u2019s expressive, continuous-time, and scalable MTPP modeling.",
