  "synthesis_narrative": "TrackIME\u2019s core idea\u2014estimating an instance\u2019s motion from a set of tracked points and using it to prune correspondence search while handling occlusions\u2014stands at the intersection of classic point tracking, dense correspondence, and instance-centric propagation. Lucas\u2013Kanade provides the foundational notion of tracking sparse points under a local motion model; Brox and Malik advanced this by showing that grouping long-term point trajectories yields coherent object-level motion. Modern dense correspondence methods such as RAFT and recurrent multi-frame refinements like DROID-SLAM achieved strong accuracy but at high computational cost, typically relying on downsampled features or broad all-pairs search. TrackIME directly addresses this bottleneck by shifting from exhaustive matching to instance-guided pruning.\n\nConcurrently, the TAP-Vid benchmark crystallized the \u2018track any point\u2019 task and highlighted the importance of visibility and occlusion handling. TrackIME targets this setting but preserves full-resolution fidelity by shrinking the search region to the predicted instance footprint. The mechanism echoes two influential paradigms: VOS with space-time memory, which constrains computation to object regions and bridges occlusions via memory, and object tracking frameworks like SORT that predict motion to localize association windows efficiently. Synthesizing these lines, TrackIME aggregates multiple point trajectories to estimate instance motion, prunes the search to those regions to avoid downsampling losses, and compensates occluded points\u2014achieving efficient, accurate, full-resolution point tracking.",
