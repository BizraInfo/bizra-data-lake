  "synthesis_narrative": "Spectral Contrastive Loss established that augmentation-based self-supervision aligns learned features with the top eigenspace of a kernel or graph Laplacian induced by augmentations, pinpointing a concrete operator-theoretic target for pretraining. Earlier, theoretical analyses of contrastive learning introduced a formal pretrain\u2013then\u2013linear-probe pipeline and clarified how linear evaluation reflects representation quality in a stylized setting. Complementing this, the alignment\u2013uniformity view identified augmentation-driven alignment as the geometric bias that enables strong performance, while leaving open how to translate this geometry into statistical guarantees. Multi-view theoretical frameworks further codified augmentations as views and linked contrastive pretraining to downstream linear tasks, setting the stage for rigorous analysis with linear probes. On the statistical side, classic RKHS theory provided sharp estimation-error characterizations for regularized least squares under source and capacity assumptions, and benign overfitting results explained when ridgeless or highly overparameterized regression can still generalize due to spectral properties of the data kernel.\nBringing these strands together naturally suggested viewing augmentation-based pretraining as approximating an augmentation-induced RKHS target and the linear probe as RKHS regression. The operator viewpoint (eigenspaces of augmentation kernels) provides the approximation target, multi-view contrastive formulations supply the problem setup, and RKHS/generalization theory delivers model-complexity-free bounds. The remaining gap\u2014formalizing the augmentation geometry\u2014motivated the isometry property, which, combined with RKHS rates and benign overfitting insights, yields generalization guarantees that disentangle augmentation effects from encoder complexity.",
