  "synthesis_narrative": "Bipolar Self-attention (BSA) emerges at the intersection of efficient attention computation and spike-based neural processing. The original Transformer introduced dot-product attention with softmax, establishing row-stochastic weights and a probabilistic interpretation that BSA explicitly seeks to preserve under spiking constraints. Subsequent advances in softmax-free or approximated attention, notably Linear Transformers and Performer, demonstrated that expensive exponentials and quadratic-time operations can be sidestepped via kernelization and positive random features while still enabling principled normalization. This line directly motivates BSA\u2019s spike-native normalization that restores row-stochasticity without energy-intensive multiply\u2013accumulate or exponentials.\n\nOn the arithmetic side, XNOR-Net crystallized the idea that binary operations (XNOR\u2013popcount) can replace MACs, a key tenet for energy-efficient spiking computation. However, binary interactions cannot represent the sign structure needed for negative\u2013negative and positive\u2013negative query\u2013key interactions. Trained Ternary Quantization provided the conceptual and algorithmic bridge: ternary representations recover sign information at marginal extra cost, informing BSA\u2019s ternary spike matrix multiplication that captures richer membrane potential interactions while remaining hardware-friendly.\n\nFinally, making such a fully spike-driven attention mechanism trainable hinges on surrogate gradient methods for non-differentiable spikes, as consolidated by Neftci et al. Together, these works directly shape BSA\u2019s core: a ternary, spike-native attention that reinstates the probabilistic (row-stochastic) semantics of attention with minimal compute, closing the performance gap for spiking Transformers.",
