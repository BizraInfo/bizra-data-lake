  "synthesis_narrative": "TransMLA\u2019s key contribution\u2014converting widely deployed GQA-based LLMs into MLA models with full DeepSeek compatibility and measurable speedups\u2014stands on two converging lines of prior work. First, the DeepSeek series (V2/V3/R1) specifies the MLA architecture and Absorb operation that compress the KV cache through low-rank latent factors while preventing cache bloat. These works define the target operator semantics and runtime ABI that TransMLA must match; the paper\u2019s promise of \u201cfull DeepSeek compatibility\u201d means converted weights must function identically under MLA kernels introduced and stabilized across V2/V3 and used in R1 reasoning models.\nSecond, TransMLA starts from the industry-standard efficiency lineage of MQA and GQA (Shazeer, Ainslie et al.), where K/V sharing across heads reduces KV memory but trades off expressivity. Their parameterizations and initialization tricks enable principled mappings from grouped K/V to MLA\u2019s latent space, providing a concrete conversion path rather than retraining from scratch. To justify that MLA can exceed GQA expressivity at the same KV budget, the paper leverages the broader low-rank attention literature\u2014especially Linformer\u2019s results that attention often admits low-rank K/V projections without sacrificing quality. Finally, the conversion\u2019s practical mechanics mirror LoRA-style low-rank factorization with a subsequent merge (absorb) step that preserves tensor shapes and runtime efficiency. Together, these works supply the architectural target (MLA/Absorb), the source parameterization (GQA/MQA), the theoretical rationale for low-rank K/V, and the algorithmic toolkit for stable low-rank merging\u2014directly enabling TransMLA\u2019s seamless migration framework.",
