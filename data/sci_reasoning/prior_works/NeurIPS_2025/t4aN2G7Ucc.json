  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014dimension-adapted Nesterov acceleration (DANA) that improves loss scaling exponents over SGD and SGD-M\u2014sits at the intersection of momentum design, stochastic optimization limits, and power-law scaling theory. On the algorithmic side, Nesterov (2004) and Polyak (1964) supply the canonical momentum mechanisms and baselines. Classical stochastic acceleration results (Ghadimi & Lan, 2012) explain why, under conventional tuning, momentum often fails to improve noise-limited rates\u2014mirroring the paper\u2019s finding that SGD-M preserves SGD\u2019s exponents\u2014thereby motivating a new, problem-size\u2013aware tuning regime.\nOn the modeling side, the power-law random features setup and its parameterization by data and target complexities are grounded in spectral alignment ideas (Canatar, Bordelon, Pehlevan, 2021), which explain how the eigenspectrum and target structure dictate learning-curve phases. These tools enable the authors to predict four distinct loss-curve shapes and to derive where scaling momentum with dimension and complexity yields advantages.\nFinally, the broader scaling-laws literature (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022) and hyperparameter scaling via gradient-noise principles (McCandlish et al., 2018) set the objective: improving loss\u2013compute power laws and compute-optimality. DANA operationalizes this by adapting momentum hyperparameters to model size and data-target complexity, yielding provably improved exponents and better compute-optimal behavior. Together, these prior works directly underpin the paper\u2019s theoretical framework, algorithmic design, and empirical focus on outscaling SGD in both synthetic quadratics and large-scale language modeling.",
