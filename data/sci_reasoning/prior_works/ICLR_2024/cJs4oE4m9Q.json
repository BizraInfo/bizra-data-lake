  "synthesis_narrative": "Support Vector Data Description established the one-class paradigm of enclosing normal data within a minimum-radius hypersphere, formalizing the hyperball decision region. Deep One-Class Classification embedded this idea into deep networks by learning a latent representation while minimizing distances to a center and shrinking the radius, operationalizing hypersphere learning in practice. Deep Semi-Supervised Anomaly Detection retained the hypersphere center\u2013radius geometry while leveraging a few labeled anomalies, revealing sensitivity to representation mismatch and the tendency of high-dimensional features to spread radially. In parallel, DROCC sought tighter one-class boundaries by generating adversarial near-boundary samples, emphasizing the importance of compact decision regions around the normal manifold. From representation learning, SphereFace showed that L2-normalizing features to the hypersphere and optimizing angular geometry improves class separation, highlighting the benefits of constraining embeddings to a spherical manifold. Complementarily, Ring Loss demonstrated that pushing feature norms toward a fixed radius concentrates mass into a thin shell, reducing radial variance and effectively producing a hyperspherical shell.\n\nTogether these works suggest that while hypersphere-based anomaly objectives are powerful, they suffer when features do not conform to spherical geometry and when the hyperball boundary is not compact in high dimensions; simultaneously, hyperspherical embeddings and ring-style norm control indicate that geometric constraints and shell-like concentration can yield tighter regions. Building on these insights, the present work aligns feature distributions with the hypersphere assumption via an orthogonal transform and replaces the hyperball with a bi-hypersphere shell, synthesizing compactness and geometric compliance in a unified deep anomaly detection framework.",

In this paper, we first propose a novel deep anomaly detection model that improves the original hypersphere learning through an orthogonal projection layer, which ensures that the training data distribution is consistent with the hypersphere hypothesis, thereby increasing the true positive rate and decreasing the false negative rate. Moreover, we propose a bi-hypersphere compression method to obtain a hyperspherical shell that yields a more compact decision region than a hyperball, which is demonstrated theoretically and numerically.  The proposed methods are not confined to common datasets such as image and tabular data, but are also extended to a more challenging but promising scenario, graph-level anomaly detection, which le",
