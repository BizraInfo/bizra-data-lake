  "synthesis_narrative": "LSEnet\u2019s core idea\u2014recovering graph clusters and their number by minimizing a differentiable structural information (DSI)\u2014sits at the intersection of information-theoretic community detection and hyperbolic representation learning. The information-theoretic lineage traces back to Infomap (Rosvall & Bergstrom), which casts clustering as minimizing a description length of flows and naturally discovers hierarchical partitions without fixing K. LSEnet internalizes this principle but departs critically by defining a continuous, differentiable structural information tailored to node-attributed graphs, enabling gradient-based learning. This step builds on the broader foundation of graph/structural entropy measures surveyed by Mowshowitz & Dehmer, whose non-differentiable, topology-only formulations motivated LSEnet\u2019s differentiable, feature-aware DSI.\n\nTo operationalize hierarchical structure, LSEnet leverages hyperbolic geometry: Nickel & Kiela\u2019s Lorentz model provides a faithful geometric substrate for tree-like hierarchies, while Chami et al.\u2019s Hyperbolic GCN offers practical Riemannian layers and optimization tools. LSEnet extends these hyperbolic methods to encode and optimize the DSI-induced partitioning tree within Lorentz space.\n\nFinally, LSEnet responds to limitations in prevailing deep clustering pipelines. VGAE-style graph encoders followed by k-means and DEC-like objectives achieve strong results but require a pre-specified number of clusters. By replacing fixed-K assignment objectives with DSI minimization, LSEnet directly addresses this gap, yielding a principled, end-to-end approach to deep graph clustering with unknown K.",
