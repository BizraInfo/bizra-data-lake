  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014provable identifiability of unsupervised object-centric representations\u2014emerges at the intersection of two lines of work: practical slot-based object discovery and theoretical identifiability in nonlinear latent-variable models. Slot Attention, MONet, and IODINE established the modern problem formulation: scenes as compositions of object latents, with permutation-equivariant/invariant encoders producing object \u201cslots.\u201d Yet these influential systems lacked guarantees about when slots correspond to ground-truth objects. On the theory side, identifiability results for nonlinear ICA (Hyv\u00e4rinen et al.) and identifiable VAEs (Khemakhem et al.) showed that latent recovery becomes possible if one injects the right structure or auxiliary signals. Locatello et al.\u2019s impossibility theorem crystallized the gap: without inductive biases, unsupervised disentanglement is not identifiable. This paper closes that gap for object-centric learning by positing compositionality (scenes formed by combining object-specific mechanisms) and irreducibility (objects are the minimal units), and by analyzing invertible, compositional inference models tailored to sets. The Deep Sets representation theorem provides the mathematical backbone for treating objects as unordered entities and constraining the inference class. Together, these works directly shaped the new theory: practical object-centric architectures motivated the compositional assumptions; identifiability in nonlinear ICA/VAEs provided the analytical toolkit; and the impossibility result dictated the need for explicit inductive biases that the paper formulates and proves sufficient.",
