  "synthesis_narrative": "NaturalSpeech 3\u2019s core innovation\u2014explicitly factorizing both the speech codec and the generative model into content, prosody, timbre, and acoustic-detail subspaces\u2014emerges at the intersection of codec-based zero-shot TTS and diffusion-based generation. VALL-E crystallized the zero-shot, prompt-conditioned problem formulation using neural codec tokens, but its autoregressive language modeling over EnCodec\u2019s residual-quantized codes left speech quality, similarity, and prosody under-constrained. NaturalSpeech 2 demonstrated that switching to diffusion in codec space dramatically improves naturalness, providing the immediate backbone that NaturalSpeech 3 extends. AudioLM\u2019s multi-stage separation of semantic and acoustic tokens directly motivated a stronger, attribute-wise factorization; NaturalSpeech 3 generalizes this idea beyond a two-level hierarchy to four disentangled subspaces and aligns each with tailored prompts. The codec lineage from SoundStream to EnCodec supplied the discrete audio token infrastructure but also the key limitation: residual vector quantization entangles attributes across codebooks, hindering controllability and prosody fidelity. NaturalSpeech 3 directly addresses this by introducing a factorized vector quantizer that assigns disjoint subspaces to specific attributes, and pairs it with a factorized diffusion model that generates each attribute stream conditioned on its corresponding prompt. Foundationally, Grad-TTS established diffusion as a strong conditional generator for TTS, which NaturalSpeech 3 adapts and compartmentalizes to realize high-quality, controllable zero-shot synthesis.",
