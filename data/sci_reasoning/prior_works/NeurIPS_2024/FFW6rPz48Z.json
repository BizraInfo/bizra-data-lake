  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper fuses two lines of work: classical multi-task learning (MTL) as regularization and modern random matrix theory (RMT) for precise high-dimensional risk analysis. The MTL foundation is provided by Evgeniou and Pontil\u2019s regularized MTL framework and subsequent convex multi-task feature learning, which formalize how shared structure across tasks can be encoded and solved in closed form for linear models. Ando and Zhang further motivate leveraging common predictive subspaces so that single-task learners benefit from multi-task information\u2014exactly the operational goal of the present regularization scheme.\nOn the high-dimensional statistics side, Dobriban and Wager deliver deterministic-equivalent risk formulas for ridge regression, while Hastie et al. show how spectral characteristics, noise, and sample sizes govern out-of-sample error. These works supply the analytical blueprint the authors extend from single-task to multi-task settings, yielding closed-form training/testing error estimates and principled hyperparameter tuning. Louart et al. contribute RMT methods and universality insights that enable analysis beyond Gaussian designs, aligning with the paper\u2019s explicit non-Gaussian guarantees. Finally, De Mol, Giannone, and Reichlin connect ridge-type shrinkage to time-series forecasting efficacy, grounding the paper\u2019s application to multivariate forecasting.\nTogether, these prior works directly inform the paper\u2019s core innovation: an RMT-based, distribution-robust theory for multi-task linear regression that translates shared-task structure into precise performance predictions tied to covariances, signal hyperplanes, noise, and data scale.",
