  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014training-free enforcement of strict, domain-specific constraints within Stable Diffusion\u2014emerges from three converging lines of prior work. First, Latent Diffusion Models (Rombach et al.) and the DDPM framework (Ho et al.) supply the generative and sampling scaffolding, with latent-space efficiency critical for inserting computationally tractable constraint handling. Second, guidance-based diffusion (Dhariwal & Nichol) and diffusion posterior sampling for inverse problems (Chung & Ye) establish that external gradients\u2014originating from classifiers, likelihoods, or physics forward models\u2014can steer the sampling trajectory without retraining. This paper extends that idea from soft, probabilistic consistency to stricter satisfaction by embedding explicit constrained optimization steps into the reverse process. Third, classical optimization with learned priors, particularly Plug-and-Play ADMM (Venkatakrishnan et al.) and RED (Romano et al.), demonstrates how powerful denoisers can serve as priors within iterative solvers to satisfy data fidelity or feasibility constraints. The present work translates this denoiser-prior perspective to diffusion priors, effectively alternating between diffusion updates and constraint-enforcing steps. Finally, optimization-in-the-loop methods like DreamFusion validate the practicality of marrying diffusion scores with differentiable objective functions in a training-free way. Together, these works directly motivate a principled integration of Stable Diffusion with constrained optimization, enabling strict physics and functional constraint adherence for tasks such as material and inverse design without additional model training.",
