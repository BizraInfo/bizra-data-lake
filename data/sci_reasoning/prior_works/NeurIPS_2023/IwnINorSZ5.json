  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014conformal meta-learners that provide distribution-free predictive intervals for individual treatment effects\u2014emerges by fusing two mature literatures: conformal prediction and meta-learning for heterogeneous treatment effects. On the conformal side, Vovk\u2013Gammerman\u2013Shafer established the basic conformity-score machinery and marginal coverage guarantees, while Lei et al. provided the split conformal recipe that makes model-agnostic, finite-sample predictive inference practical. On the causal side, meta-learner templates by K\u00fcnzel et al. (S/T/X-learners) codified how to assemble nuisance models into CATE estimators via two-stage regression. Orthogonalization-centric learners\u2014Nie and Wager\u2019s R-learner and Kennedy\u2019s DR-learner\u2014supplied pseudo-outcomes whose construction attenuates nuisance estimation error, a property formalized by Chernozhukov et al.\u2019s double/debiased machine learning framework through Neyman-orthogonal scores and cross-fitting. TMLE (van der Laan and Rubin) further grounds the use of influence-function-based targets and doubly robust pseudo-outcomes that are amenable to stable second-stage regression. The present paper bridges these streams by applying split conformal prediction to the pseudo-outcomes generated by meta-learners and introducing a stochastic ordering criterion: marginal validity follows when pseudo-outcome conformity scores dominate the unattainable oracle ITE scores. It then verifies this condition for widely used two-stage learners (e.g., R/DR/X), thereby transforming point-estimation meta-learners into conformal meta-learners with rigorous predictive intervals for ITEs.",
