  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014casting diverse solution sampling for graph combinatorial optimization (CO) as conditional GFlowNet policy learning over carefully designed MDPs\u2014rests on two pillars: GFlowNet methodology and neural constructive approaches to CO. Foundational GFlowNet works (Bengio et al.) supply the sequential flow-based sampling paradigm for unnormalized targets, while Trajectory Balance (Malkin et al.) and Subtrajectory Balance (Madan et al.) provide robust long-horizon credit assignment and sample-efficient training\u2014capabilities that are crucial when constructing large graph solutions under hard constraints. Prior applications of GFlowNets to structured graphs, notably Bayesian structure learning (Deleu et al.), demonstrate how to encode constraints and posteriors over graph spaces as rewards and MDP dynamics, directly informing this paper\u2019s MDP design for varied CO tasks.\n\nOn the CO side, neural constructive and RL formulations (Bello et al.; Dai et al.) established the MDP viewpoint for building solutions step-by-step on graphs (e.g., MIS, MaxCut), exposing the exploration\u2013exploitation and long-range credit challenges that GFlowNets are well positioned to address. Attention-based amortized solvers (Kool et al.) showed the benefits of amortization across instances, motivating the paper\u2019s conditional GFlowNets that generalize across problem distributions while generating diverse, high-quality candidates. Integrating these strands, the paper leverages GFlowNets\u2019 diversity-promoting sampling and improved credit assignment to amortize search over graph CO solution spaces, yielding efficient discovery of multiple high-reward feasible solutions.",
