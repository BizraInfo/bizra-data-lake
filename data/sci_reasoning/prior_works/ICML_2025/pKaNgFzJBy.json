  "synthesis_narrative": "The core contribution of \u201cOn the Guidance of Flow Matching\u201d is a unified guidance framework for general flow-matching models, yielding training-free asymptotically exact guidance, new training-based guidance losses, and principled approximate gradient guidance. This builds directly on the foundations laid by Conditional Flow Matching, which formulates generative modeling by learning pathwise velocity fields along arbitrary interpolants; the new work augments that formulation with guidance terms in both training and sampling. Stochastic Interpolants provides the continuity-equation view and path-distribution calculus that the paper exploits to define guidance on general interpolants and to prove asymptotic exactness of its training-free method. From the diffusion side, Score-Based Generative Modeling through SDEs and DDIM establish the probability-flow ODE and deterministic ODE sampling perspectives; the present paper generalizes the idea of modifying ODE drifts for guidance from diffusion-specific dynamics to arbitrary flow-matching paths. Critically, the widely used diffusion guidance mechanisms\u2014classifier guidance (Dhariwal & Nichol) and classifier-free guidance (Ho & Salimans)\u2014serve as immediate baselines and inspirations: the authors\u2019 approximate guidance recovers classical gradient guidance as a special case, while their training-based objectives are the flow-matching analogues of classifier-free guidance. Together, these works directly shaped the paper\u2019s framework, which fills the explicit gap of principled, general guidance for flow matching beyond diffusion-only formulations.",
