  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014turning the CLIP training loss into a universal data selection metric (negCLIPLoss) and complementing it with norm-based signals\u2014stands on three converging lines of prior work. First, CLIP and its InfoNCE roots formalized contrastive learning with in-batch negatives and a symmetric image\u2013text objective. By directly reusing this loss structure at selection time, the authors transform a training principle into a scoring function, preserving the relative, competition-with-negatives signal that pure cosine alignment omits. Second, universal metric baselines such as CLIPScore and the widespread LAION practice of cosine-threshold filtering established that CLIP embeddings could guide web-scale filtering\u2014but did so with positive-only evidence. Insights from VSE++ and supervised contrastive learning underscored that negative structure (hard negatives and bidirectional alignment) is crucial for assessing the true distinctiveness of a pair, motivating negCLIPLoss\u2019s full-matrix view. Third, DataComp crystallized data selection as a core driver of CLIP performance and provided standardized protocols, encouraging methods that work across models without training specialized selectors. The paper advances this under-explored metric-driven path by (i) injecting the contrastive denominator into the selection score and (ii) exploiting representation geometry via embedding norms, yielding practical, model-agnostic filters that better correlate with downstream utility than cosine-only baselines.",
