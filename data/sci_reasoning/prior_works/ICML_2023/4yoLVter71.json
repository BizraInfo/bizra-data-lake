  "synthesis_narrative": "Quantile Credit Assignment (QCA) fuses two lines of prior work: distributional value estimation and variance-reduced policy gradients. The distributional RL foundation laid by Bellemare et al. introduced modeling full return distributions, which QR-DQN operationalized via quantile regression and quantile networks. Implicit Quantile Networks extended this by conditioning on quantile levels \u03c4, a mechanism QCA reinterprets as a latent measure of environmental luck. This reinterpretation is the key step that transforms distributional estimates into a luck-dependent baseline for policy gradients.\n\nOn the policy-gradient side, Greensmith et al. formalized unbiased baselines/control variates for variance reduction, while GAE became the dominant practical baseline; QCA explicitly improves upon this standard by replacing a single value baseline with a distribution-aware, \u03c4-conditioned baseline that remains unbiased yet lowers variance. Prior variance-reduction methods with action-dependent control variates (e.g., Liu et al.) exposed a gap: large variance reductions often required stronger critics or action dependence. QCA addresses this by exploiting distributional critics to obtain a powerful action-independent control variate rooted in quantile estimation. Finally, the HQCA variant draws inspiration from hindsight-based credit assignment exemplified by RUDDER, explicitly incorporating future trajectory information to better separate luck from skill. Together, these works directly enable QCA/HQCA\u2019s core innovation: unbiased policy-gradient estimators that use quantile-conditioned baselines to substantially reduce variance and improve credit assignment.",
