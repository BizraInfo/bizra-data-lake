  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014computable Clarke hyper-stationarity for bilevel optimization without demanding smooth or unique lower-level solutions\u2014sits at the intersection of classical nonsmooth analysis, parametric optimization, and modern weak-convexity algorithms. Clarke\u2019s foundational framework for generalized gradients provides the exact stationarity notion the authors target when the hyper-objective is nonsmooth. Rockafellar and Wets, together with Bonnans and Shapiro, supply the variational and perturbation-analysis toolkit for marginal (value) functions and set-valued mappings; these ideas motivate modeling the hyper-objective as a value function and clarifying how its subdifferential and curvature properties arise from the parametric dependence of the solution set. Robinson\u2019s strong regularity and implicit-function theory for generalized equations directly inspire the paper\u2019s set smoothness concept, which captures Lipschitz-like and variational stability of the lower-level solution map without requiring uniqueness or strong convexity.\n\nWithin bilevel optimization specifically, Ye and Zhu established value-function reformulations and stationarity principles that the present work extends to the Clarke setting. Crucially, once set smoothness guarantees weak convexity (pessimistic) or weak concavity (optimistic) of the hyper-objective, the algorithmic pathway opened by Davis and Drusvyatskiy\u2019s weakly convex optimization results becomes available to compute Clarke-stationary solutions. Finally, prior implicit-differentiation approaches such as Pedregosa\u2019s highlight the limitations of smooth/strongly-convex assumptions that this paper overcomes, replacing classical smooth hypergradients with robust Clarke subdifferential calculus grounded in set smoothness.",
