  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014tight characterization of the sample\u2013communication trade-off for federated Q-learning and the Fed-DVR-Q algorithm that attains it\u2014rests on two intertwined lines of prior work. From federated optimization, FedAvg established the intermittent communication template (periodic local updates with global averaging), while Local SGD theory quantified when such local progress can yield linear speedup and how infrequent synchronization induces client drift. Building on these, SCAFFOLD introduced control variates to actively correct drift, demonstrating that variance reduction is central to reconciling few communications with fast convergence. These ideas directly inform Fed-DVR-Q\u2019s distributed variance-reduction mechanism tailored to Q-updates.\nOn the reinforcement learning side, classical finite-time analyses of tabular Q-learning (e.g., Speedy Q-learning) provide the contraction-based backbone and benchmark dependencies on the discount factor for achieving near-optimal sample complexity. The modern variance-reduction program for MDPs with generative models sharpened these dependencies and furnished tools to reduce stochastic noise in Bellman updates, which Fed-DVR-Q adapts in a federated, sample-sharing context. Finally, the paper\u2019s converse bound adapts communication lower-bound methodologies from distributed optimization (\u00e0 la Arjevani\u2013Shamir) to the RL setting, revealing an intrinsic \u03a9(1/(1\u2212\u03b3)) communication cost for any algorithm that seeks linear sample-speedup across M agents. Together, these works converge to enable a federated Q-learning algorithm that is simultaneously sample-optimal and communication-efficient, while explaining why this joint optimality necessarily incurs the stated communication cost.",
