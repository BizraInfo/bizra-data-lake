  "synthesis_narrative": "Farseer\u2019s core contribution\u2014a refined, bi-variate loss surface L(N, D) that enables accurate extrapolation across model and data scales\u2014sits squarely in the intellectual lineage of neural scaling laws. Kaplan et al. (2020) and Henighan et al. (2020) established the empirical power-law relationships and fitting practices that make performance predictable as resources grow, while Hestness et al. (2017) provided early multi-domain evidence that such predictability is robust. Building on this, Hoffmann et al. (2022) introduced the compute-optimal Chinchilla law, formalizing the N\u2013D trade-off under fixed compute and setting the prevailing baseline for planning large-scale training runs.\n\nHowever, both practice and theory have revealed regimes where simple power laws can mispredict. Bahri et al. (2021) offered a theoretical account of when power laws emerge and where systematic corrections matter, motivating a more flexible functional form than a single-axis power law. Farseer operationalizes this insight by directly modeling the two-dimensional loss surface and fitting it across regimes, thereby reducing extrapolation error relative to Chinchilla when moving beyond the original data domain. Finally, Hernandez et al. (2021) linked pretraining scaling to downstream performance, underscoring the value of dependable extrapolation for real-world decision-making. By synthesizing these strands\u2014foundational empirical laws, compute-optimal trade-offs, theoretical guidance on deviations, and transfer predictability\u2014Farseer delivers a practically useful, higher-fidelity scaling law that lets small-scale ablations reliably inform large-scale LLM training strategies.",
