  "synthesis_narrative": "3DMRL tackles a central gap in molecular relational learning: existing multi-relational predictors (e.g., Decagon) rely largely on 2D topology even though true interaction behavior is governed by 3D geometry. Two strands of prior work bridge this gap. First, 3D molecular GNNs such as SchNet and EGNN establish that modeling local and global geometric structure\u2014and doing so with Euclidean equivariance\u2014yields powerful representations. Second, cross-modal pretraining like 3D-Infomax shows a pragmatic recipe for transferring 3D knowledge into 2D encoders using inexpensive conformers, avoiding costly quantum labels. To operationalize 3D supervision specifically for interactions, fast geometry generators are essential. ETKDG supplies scalable single-molecule conformers, while modern docking methods\u2014EquiBind and DiffDock\u2014extend this idea to molecular pairs, producing plausible protein\u2013ligand (or more general) interaction poses without QM calculations. Together, these works provide the blueprint for 3DMRL: construct a virtual 3D interaction environment using efficient conformer/docking generators; encode geometry with principles from equivariant learning; and pretrain a 2D relational model to internalize global and local 3D interaction cues. This combination directly enables 3DMRL to deliver 3D-aware MRL without prohibitive simulation costs and explains its strong out-of-distribution and extrapolation performance across real-world tasks.",
