  "synthesis_narrative": "RUM\u2019s central move\u2014replacing graph convolution with random-walk-driven, recurrent-memory aggregation\u2014directly arises from the interplay of three research threads. First, convolutional/message-passing GNNs (Kipf & Welling) provided the dominant template but revealed practical and theoretical limitations: expressivity capped at 1-WL (Xu et al.), oversmoothing from repeated Laplacian smoothing (Li et al.), and information bottlenecks leading to oversquashing (Alon & Yahav). These works collectively frame what RUM seeks to avoid: depth-coupled propagation that requires specialized sparse kernels, homogenizes features, and compresses long-range signals.\n\nSecond, random-walk-based propagation demonstrated a viable, non-local alternative. APPNP (Klicpera et al.) leveraged personalized PageRank to decouple feature transformation from propagation, showing that stochastic-walk diffusion can improve stability and mitigate oversmoothing. node2vec (Grover & Leskovec) established that sequences generated by biased random walks capture both topological and semantic structure, suggesting walks as a natural primitive for representation learning beyond synchronous neighbor averaging.\n\nThird, the RNN literature (Cho et al., GRU) supplied the mechanism to turn walk sequences into learnable, controllable memory. By merging features along sampled walks with gated recurrence, RUM replaces fixed diffusion with adaptive sequence aggregation, enabling long-range dependency handling without deep stacks of message-passing layers. Synthesizing these insights, RUM offers a non-convolutional, memory-efficient module that improves expressivity beyond 1-WL while attenuating oversmoothing and oversquashing, and it does so with simpler dense-kernel compute compared to conventional sparse GNN pipelines.",
