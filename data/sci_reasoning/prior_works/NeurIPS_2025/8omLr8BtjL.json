  "synthesis_narrative": "UFO\u2019s core contribution\u2014unifying fine-grained perception (detection and segmentation) and image-level vision\u2013language tasks behind an open-ended language interface with a retrieval-based segmentation mechanism\u2014emerges from two converging threads of prior work. First, CLIP established a robust shared embedding space that makes open-vocabulary learning and language-driven retrieval feasible. Building on this, GLIP showed that object detection can be naturally reframed as language grounding, and Pix2Seq demonstrated that detection targets can be emitted as sequences, bringing classical perception into a language-modeling paradigm. These works collectively motivate UFO\u2019s decision to represent object-level outputs as language tokens.\nSecond, open-vocabulary segmentation methods like CLIPSeg and OpenSeg revealed that pixel or region features can be aligned with text embeddings to obtain masks without category-specific heads. This directly inspires UFO\u2019s mask generation via embedding retrieval that operates solely through the language interface, avoiding bespoke decoders. Finally, generalist architectures such as Unified-IO validated that a single sequence interface can span detection, segmentation, and V+L tasks, paving the way for UFO\u2019s broader unification. Synthesizing these advances, UFO integrates object-level sequence modeling with pixel-level embedding alignment in a single language-centric framework, bridging fine-grained perception and vision\u2013language tasks while minimizing task-specific architectural components.",
