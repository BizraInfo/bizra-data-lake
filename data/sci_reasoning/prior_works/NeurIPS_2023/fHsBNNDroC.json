  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of Calibrated Stackelberg Games (CSGs) is to replace direct observation of the leader\u2019s action with calibrated forecasts and to show that, despite this informational constraint, the principal can still attain the classical Stackelberg commitment value. This rests on two intertwined pillars: Stackelberg commitment and calibrated forecasting. On the commitment side, Conitzer and Sandholm formalized computing the leader\u2019s optimal mixed commitment; CSGs show that carefully designed forecasts can replicate the same follower responses, recovering this benchmark payoff. The information-design perspective of Kamenica\u2013Gentzkow clarifies why: forecasts function as signals that steer the follower\u2019s best response subject to Bayes-consistency, and calibration enforces these Bayes plausibility constraints over time.\nOn the forecasting side, Foster\u2013Vohra established both the strategic relevance of calibrated forecasts\u2014best responses to calibrated predictions lead to equilibrium\u2014and the existence of calibrated forecasters in adversarial environments. Blackwell\u2019s approachability provides the geometric engine behind such calibration procedures. Building on these, the CSG paper strengthens guarantees via \u2018adaptive calibration,\u2019 delivering anytime, fine-grained robustness suitable for repeated strategic interaction. Finally, ideas from multicalibration (Hebert-Johnson et al.) inform the need for calibration that holds simultaneously across adaptively revealed conditions, aligning with the paper\u2019s uniform and adversarial guarantees. Together, these works directly shape the CSG framework, its algorithmic design for adaptive calibration, and the proof that calibrated signaling suffices to achieve optimal Stackelberg commitment utility.",
