  "synthesis_narrative": "This paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014modeling all DC decompositions of a CPWL function (over a fixed polyhedral complex) as a polyhedron given by the intersection of two translated cones, and linking irreducible/minimal decompositions to bounded faces/vertices\u2014emerges from a precise lineage. Hartman\u2019s DC representation theorem lays the conceptual foundation that nonconvex functions can be expressed as differences of convex ones. Fulton\u2019s toric support-function framework provides the structural fact that convex CPWL functions compatible with a fixed complex form a rational polyhedral cone, the exact geometric object the authors translate and intersect to parametrize DC decompositions. Lov\u00e1sz\u2019s extension and Edmonds\u2019 base polyhedron connect discrete submodularity to convex CPWL geometry and extremal polyhedral structure, directly informing the paper\u2019s correspondence between irreducibility/minimality and bounded faces/vertices of the decomposition polyhedron. On the algorithmic/related-problem side, Iyer and Bilmes\u2019s DS decomposition work motivates a polyhedral treatment of difference-type decompositions, which this paper elevates from discrete to continuous CPWL settings. Finally, Zhang\u2013Naitzat\u2013Lim\u2019s tropical characterization of ReLU networks frames CPWL/DC decompositions as central to neural network theory, while Tran and Wang\u2019s recent minimal-representation proposal highlights a gap the authors address by disproving that approach and replacing it with a correct polyhedral characterization tied to minimal-piece solutions.",
