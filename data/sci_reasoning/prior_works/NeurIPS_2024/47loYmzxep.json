  "synthesis_narrative": "E2E-MFD\u2019s key contribution\u2014an end-to-end, synchronous optimization framework that jointly learns multimodal image fusion and object detection while explicitly managing gradient interactions\u2014emerges at the confluence of task-agnostic fusion networks, end-to-end detection, and multi-task optimization theory. Classical IR\u2013VIS fusion methods such as DenseFuse and U2Fusion established that learnable fusion can preserve structure and detail, but they typically train fusion models independently of downstream tasks. In parallel, end-to-end detectors like DETR demonstrated the benefits of single-phase training that removes hand-crafted stages and post-processing. E2E-MFD unifies these directions by integrating the fusion module directly with the detection head in a single training loop, ensuring the fused representation is shaped by detection objectives.\nCritically, the paper addresses a central obstacle in joint training: conflicting gradients for shared parameters across objectives (fusion quality vs. detection accuracy). Foundational multi-task learning works\u2014MGDA\u2019s Pareto-based gradient composition, GradNorm\u2019s adaptive balancing via gradient magnitudes, and PCGrad\u2019s conflict-aware gradient surgery\u2014directly inform E2E-MFD\u2019s comprehensive gradient-matrix strategy. By adopting the principle of coordinating gradients to mitigate interference, E2E-MFD avoids the suboptimal minima common in stagewise or naively joint setups. Finally, insights from multispectral detection (e.g., illumination-aware Faster R-CNN) underscore the value of modality fusion for robust perception, while highlighting limitations of decoupled pipelines\u2014limitations E2E-MFD overcomes through synchronous, end-to-end optimization that boosts both fusion quality and detection mAP.",
