  "synthesis_narrative": "ACE\u2019s key contribution\u2014causality-aware entropy regularization in an off-policy actor-critic\u2014sits at the intersection of maximum-entropy RL, causal credit assignment, and optimization heuristics for restoring stalled learning. SAC provides the immediate algorithmic scaffold: an off-policy actor-critic objective augmented with an entropy bonus, along with practical training stabilizers; ACE inherits this framework and replaces the uniform entropy incentive with dimension-specific entropy weights. The conceptual basis for using entropy as a principled exploration driver traces to maximum-entropy decision making, which SAC operationalizes; ACE refines that principle by tying the strength of the entropy term to each action dimension\u2019s causal contribution to returns.\nCounterfactual reasoning from causal RL directly shapes how ACE measures these contributions. Methods like counterfactually-guided policy search and COMA demonstrate how to attribute outcomes to interventions on components (agents or actions) via counterfactual baselines. ACE internalizes this idea within a single agent by treating action dimensions as primitive behaviors and computing their marginal effect on reward, then prioritizing exploration where causal influence is high. Evidence from action-branching architectures further supports the premise that action dimensions merit separate treatment, legitimizing ACE\u2019s dimension-wise entropy modulation.\nFinally, ACE addresses the gradient dormancy that arises when learning over-focuses on a subset of dimensions. Inspired by literature showing that strategic resets or weight rewinding can revive stalled subnetworks, ACE introduces a dormancy-guided reset mechanism to reanimate under-trained primitives. Together, these strands yield a targeted, causality-aware exploration scheme that improves data efficiency and performance across diverse continuous control tasks.",
