  "synthesis_narrative": "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models framed generation as reversing a noisy forward process in input space, establishing the canonical position-space SDE and long denoising trajectory. Score-Based Generative Modeling through SDEs generalized this to continuous-time SDEs with reverse-time dynamics, cementing the mathematical toolkit for designing drifts and sampling procedures. Diffusion Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge then connected generative modeling to stochastic optimal control by constructing path measures that bridge noise and data via entropy-regularized control, demonstrating that choosing the right bridge can improve sampling efficiency. In parallel, Flow Matching for Generative Modeling showed that prescribing an interpolating path and matching its velocity field provides a direct, simulation-free way to learn continuous-time generators. Stochastic Interpolants unified these ideas by making explicit that the choice of path measure determines both the loss and the learned dynamics, suggesting freedom to craft better paths. Finally, Hypoelliptic Diffusion Models introduced kinetic, velocity-augmented dynamics where noise acts in velocity, revealing that phase-space structure and momentum can enable faster mixing and early formation of meaningful samples.\nBringing these threads together naturally suggests designing a controlled path in phase space: use SOC/Schr\u00f6dinger-bridge principles to prescribe an optimal interpolant, train it via velocity/flow matching, and leverage kinetic structure to obtain informative velocities that produce realistic states early in time. The resulting phase-space stochastic bridge directly addresses the long-trajectory inefficiency of position-space diffusion by exploiting momentum to guide trajectories and by learning the bridge dynamics most conducive to efficient sampling.",

DMs work by constructing a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) in the input space (ie, position space), and using a neural network to reverse it. In this work, we introduce a novel generative modeling framework grounded in \\textbf{phase space dynamics}, where a phase space is defined as {an augmented space encompassing both position and velocity.} Leveraging insights from Stochastic Optimal Control, we construct a path measure in the phase space that enables efficient sampling. {In contrast to DMs, our framework demonstrates the capability to generate realistic data points at an early stage of dynamics propagation.} This early prediction sets the stage for efficient data generation by leveraging additional velocity information along the trajectory. On standard image generation benchmarks, our model yields favorable performance over baselines in the regime of small Number of Function Evaluation",
