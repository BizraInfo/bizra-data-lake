  "synthesis_narrative": "The core contribution of this paper\u2014explaining how multiple induction heads arise and interact, and introducing an optogenetics-inspired framework for causal, training-time activation interventions\u2014rests on a tight lineage of mechanistic interpretability work. Olsson et al. established induction heads as a concrete match-and-copy circuit for in-context learning and documented their sudden emergence, defining both the object of study and the striking phase-change phenomenon this paper targets. Elhage et al.\u2019s framework for transformer circuits provided the formal language and decomposition of attention heads that underpins the paper\u2019s subcircuit specification and manipulation. Building on the circuit methodology advanced by Wang et al. for the IOI task, the present work extends multi-head dependency analysis to the IH setting, asking why multiple IHs co-emerge and how enabling subcircuits scaffold them. Nanda et al.\u2019s account of grokking as circuit formation on synthetic tasks identified the broader gap linking phase changes to mechanistic emergence; this paper fills that gap for induction heads by charting precursor subcircuits and their dynamics. Methodologically, Chan et al.\u2019s Causal Scrubbing and Meng et al.\u2019s activation-based causal tracing/editing directly inform the causal testing toolkit; the present work extends these inference-time tools into training-time interventions to manipulate IH formation. Finally, Turner et al.\u2019s activation steering inspired the \u2018stimulation\u2019 and \u2018silencing\u2019 edits used here, yielding a causal, training-time framework to probe and shape the emergence of in-context learning circuits.",
