  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper advances complete counterfactual (L3) identifiability by introducing exogenous isomorphism as a model-level condition ensuring that all counterfactual queries agree across admissible SCMs. This agenda is anchored in Pearl\u2019s SCM formalism and the Pearl Causal Hierarchy, which define what L3-identifiability entails. Foundational identification results at L2 (Shpitser & Pearl, 2006) and the completeness program for counterfactuals at L3 (Shpitser & Pearl, 2008) delineate the logical target: guaranteeing unique answers to all counterfactuals given assumptions. However, interventional equivalence results (Hauser & B\u00fchlmann, 2012) reveal that many models remain indistinguishable at L2, highlighting the need for stronger structural constraints if one aims for L3 certainty.\nTo construct such constraints, the paper leverages two lines of work. First, transportability (Bareinboim & Pearl, 2013) provides the conceptual lens of transporting causal information across settings, which the authors specialize into \u201ccounterfactual transport\u201d via bijections on exogenous variables in their Bijective SCMs. Second, identifiability from functional restrictions in triangular models\u2014exemplified by LiNGAM (Shimizu et al., 2006) and nonlinear additive-noise models (Hoyer et al., 2009)\u2014demonstrates how exogenous independence, triangularity, and monotonicity can lift model identifiability. Building on these insights, the paper defines exogenous isomorphism and derives sufficient conditions for EI-identifiability in Bijective SCMs and Triangular Monotonic SCMs. This unifies transport-based reasoning with structurally identifiable SCM classes, furnishing theory that bridges L2 methods and fully counterfactual-consistent inference and enabling practical neural TM-SCM implementations.",
