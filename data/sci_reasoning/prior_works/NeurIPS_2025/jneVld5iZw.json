  "synthesis_narrative": "DisMo\u2019s core idea\u2014an explicit, content-agnostic motion representation learned from raw video via image-space reconstruction\u2014stands on two intertwined lineages. First, classic disentanglement in video established that motion and content can be separated and learned without labels. Denton et al. introduced factoring static content from dynamics using frame reconstruction, and MoCoGAN operationalized this separation in generative modeling by maintaining distinct motion and content latent spaces. DisMo directly adopts and modernizes these principles, using reconstruction to isolate a generic motion code that is independent of appearance, identity, or pose.\n\nSecond, open-domain motion transfer research shaped DisMo\u2019s problem framing and highlighted critical gaps. Unsupervised keypoint-based animation (Siarohin et al., Monkey-Net) and its advances (FOMM, TPSMM) enabled correspondence-free transfer but tied motion to source geometry through deformation fields, leading to overfitting and limited cross-category generalization. Pose-driven transfer (Everybody Dance Now) demonstrated compelling results but required explicit correspondences and was restricted to human motion. With the rise of diffusion-based T2V/I2V, methods like Tune-A-Video showed a persistent entanglement between motion and content/prompt semantics, producing a motion\u2013adherence trade-off. DisMo responds by learning a reusable, abstract motion code from unconstrained videos that decouples dynamics from content, enabling open-world motion transfer across disparate categories without object correspondences while mitigating drift and overfitting observed in prior paradigms.",
