  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014training a preference model to detect watermark presence without access to genuine watermarks and then using it to guide black-box, one-shot forging\u2014sits at the intersection of neural watermarking, preference modeling, and transfer-based adversarial attacks. HiDDeN and StegaStamp established the post-hoc, neural watermarking paradigm (learned encoder/decoder and robustness to common transforms) that the present work explicitly targets. SynthID extends this to a real-world, proprietary, black-box detector, crystallizing the threat model in which forging must generalize across unknown schemes.\nOn the learning side, CLIP-based preference models such as the LAION Aesthetics Predictor showed that subtle, perceptual attributes can be captured by fine-tuning large vision backbones with weak or comparative supervision. The paper repurposes this idea to learn a \u2018watermarked vs. not\u2019 preference signal from procedurally constructed pairs, eschewing any need for genuine watermarks. RankNet\u2019s pairwise logistic ranking framework provides the precise loss used to train such a model effectively on relative labels.\nFor the attack mechanism, the work draws on universal and transfer-based adversarial insights. Universal Adversarial Perturbations demonstrated that a single, content-agnostic residual can reliably induce targeted behavior across images and models; the paper operationalizes this as a universal watermark-forgery residual that transfers to unseen detectors. Finally, Noiseprint offers a forensic antecedent: it learns imperceptible camera-model residuals using proxy supervision, validating that fine-grained, nonsemantic signals can be isolated without ground-truth labels\u2014exactly the principle enabling the paper\u2019s training pipeline and its black-box, transferable forging results.",
