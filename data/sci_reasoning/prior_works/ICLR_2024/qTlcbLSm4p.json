  "synthesis_narrative": "Cascaded Diffusion Models introduced a coarse-to-fine pipeline with a base generator followed by super-resolution diffusion upsamplers, but each stage began from fresh noise, severing any continuity in the diffusion trajectory. SR3 established the diffusion formulation for super-resolution, defining how to condition on a low-resolution input while denoising at the target resolution, yet it also operated from pure high-resolution noise. SDEdit demonstrated that one can inject noise into an existing image and then continue denoising, effectively treating an image as a valid intermediate state in the diffusion process. DDIM formalized the idea that diffusion states are characterized by their timestep-dependent signal-to-noise ratios, enabling deterministic mappings and consistent continuation between timesteps. EDM elevated SNR to the central lens for designing diffusion training and sampling, showing that aligning signal-to-noise across steps is key to stable generation. Latent Diffusion offered a strong high-resolution path via a lower-resolution latent space, serving as a practical baseline for fidelity and efficiency, while ADM established a pixel-space reference point for unconditional image quality. Together, these works revealed a gap: high-resolution methods either restart the stochastic process at each scale or avoid pixel space entirely, and none account for how the same nominal noise behaves differently across resolutions in the frequency domain. Relay Diffusion synthesizes these insights by treating diffusion states as SNR-defined entities and, inspired by SDEdit\u2019s continuation mechanism, constructs an equivalent high-resolution noisy state via blurring diffusion and block noise, allowing a single trajectory to persist seamlessly across resolutions and models.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models achieved great success in image synthesis, but still face challenges in high-resolution generation. Through the lens of discrete cosine transformation, we find the main reason is that *the same noise level on a higher resolution results in a higher Signal-to-Noise Ratio in the frequency domain*. In this work, we present Relay Diffusion Model (RDM), which transfers a low-resolution image or noise into an equivalent high-resolution one for diffusion model via blurring diffusion and block noise. Therefore, the diffusion process can continue seamlessly in any new resolution or model without restarting from pure noise or low-resolution conditioning. RDM achieves state-of-the-art FID on CelebA-HQ and sFID on ImageNet 256$\\times$256, surpassing previous works such as ADM, LDM and DiT by a large margin.
