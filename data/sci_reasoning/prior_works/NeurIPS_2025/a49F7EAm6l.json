  "synthesis_narrative": "DexFlyWheel\u2019s core advance\u2014a self-improving, scalable data flywheel for dexterous manipulation\u2014synthesizes three threads of prior work: demo-bootstrapped learning for hands, residual policy refinement, and iterative data aggregation with augmentation. DAPG established that dexterous policies benefit from an IL warm start followed by RL fine-tuning; DexFlyWheel adopts this pattern as its initialization. Residual Reinforcement Learning formalized learning corrective residuals atop a base controller/policy; DexFlyWheel embeds a residual RL stage to expand generalization while retaining the competence learned from demonstrations. To continually broaden coverage, the framework closes the loop with DAgger-style dataset aggregation: policies roll out in simulation, the resulting trajectories are folded back into the training set, and the cycle repeats. Two data-centric ideas make the loop efficient and robust: HER introduced trajectory relabeling as principled augmentation, and Self-Imitation Learning showed that mining the agent\u2019s own successful rollouts can directly supervise further improvement\u2014both inform DexFlyWheel\u2019s augmentation and selection of high-value trajectories. Finally, Dactyl demonstrated that large-scale sim rollouts and domain randomization can unlock dexterous skills; DexFlyWheel leverages simulation similarly but channels it into a structured flywheel that continuously refines data and policies. Complementing this, AWR-style offline-to-online updates justify using seed demonstrations while steadily improving from newly collected data. Together, these works directly enable DexFlyWheel\u2019s closed-loop IL\u2192residual-RL\u2192rollout\u2192augmentation cycle to scale data diversity and policy capability in dexterous manipulation.",
