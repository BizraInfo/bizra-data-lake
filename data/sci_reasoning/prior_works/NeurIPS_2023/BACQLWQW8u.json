  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of Subspace Identification for Multi-Source Domain Adaptation is a theory that guarantees disentanglement of domain-invariant and domain-specific variables under weaker, more realistic assumptions, and an accompanying variational model (SIG) that operationalizes it. This advances three converging lines of prior work. First, subspace and invariance ideas from domain adaptation\u2014Subspace Alignment and MSDA theory (Mansour et al.)\u2014provided the geometric and statistical framing for learning transferable representations from multiple sources, while methods like Domain Separation Networks showed the practical value of splitting shared and private features but lacked identifiability guarantees. Second, the invariance-across-environments paradigm\u2014formalized in ICP and extended algorithmically in IRM\u2014suggested that stable mechanisms across domains can anchor generalization, yet these approaches typically hinge on stringent assumptions (e.g., many environments or invariant label mechanisms) and do not pinpoint identifiable latent subspaces. Third, identifiability advances in representation learning\u2014especially iVAE\u2019s use of auxiliary variables with variational inference\u2014demonstrated that structured environment information can render nonlinear latent variables identifiable, albeit under restrictive distributional forms. The present paper synthesizes these strands by proving identifiability of the invariant and domain-specific subspaces using multiple domains as auxiliary structure, but without imposing heavy assumptions such as monotone transforms or invariant label distributions. The SIG model then implements this theory via variational inference, directly targeting the provably identifiable subspaces to mitigate domain shift in MSDA.",
