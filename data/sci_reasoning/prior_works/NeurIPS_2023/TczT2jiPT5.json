      "role": "Conceptual and methodological foundation for measuring importance over a set of near-optimal models",
      "relationship_sentence": "RID directly builds on the Rashomon-set view introduced by MCR, generalizing from interval bounds on importance across good models to a full distribution (importance over the entire Rashomon set) and coupling it with data-perturbation stability."

      "year": 2022,
      "role": "Computational/geometric characterization of Rashomon sets",
      "relationship_sentence": "RID leverages the notion that many models achieve similar predictive performance; Rashomon Curves provide tools and intuition for enumerating/characterizing these sets, which RID exploits to aggregate variable-importance across them."

      "role": "Canonical single-model variable-importance baseline via permutation",
      "relationship_sentence": "RID is motivated in part by the instability of single-model importances such as permutation importance from Random Forests, and replaces single-model estimates with a distribution over the set of good models."

      "role": "Widely used model-agnostic/global importance and attribution baseline",
      "relationship_sentence": "RID is designed to wrap around existing global importance metrics like SHAP, transforming a single-model attribution into a Rashomon-set importance distribution that reflects explanatory multiplicity and stability."

      "relationship_sentence": "RID adopts the principle that importance should be robust to reasonable data perturbations; it echoes stability selection\u2019s subsampling ethos while extending it to aggregate importance across many comparably accurate models."

  "synthesis_narrative": "The core contribution of the RID paper is to move from single-model variable importance\u2014often unstable and non-generalizable\u2014to a distribution of variable importance values computed across the entire Rashomon set of near-optimal models, while ensuring robustness under data perturbations. This advance sits squarely on the Rashomon perspective established by Fisher, Rudin, and Dominici, whose Model Class Reliance formalized measuring feature importance over classes of equally accurate models. RID extends this idea from interval bounds to a probability distribution that captures how frequently and to what extent features matter across good models. Semenova, Rudin, and Parr\u2019s Rashomon Curves further underpin RID by characterizing and operationalizing the geometry and content of good-model sets, enabling practical aggregation over them. The paper is also a response to limitations in widely used single-model importance methods\u2014permutation importance from Random Forests and SHAP\u2014which RID can wrap to produce set- and data-stable assessments. Finally, the robustness ethos of Meinshausen and B\u00fchlmann\u2019s stability selection informs RID\u2019s emphasis on stability to data perturbations, marrying model-set aggregation with subsampling-style reliability. Together, these works directly enable RID\u2019s central innovation: a flexible, model-agnostic framework that outputs a stable, distributional view of variable importance across many equally valid explanations of the data.",
