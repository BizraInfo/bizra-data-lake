  "synthesis_narrative": "Chen and Darwiche\u2019s central contribution\u2014showing how knowledge of functional dependencies can both unlock identifiability and reduce observational requirements\u2014sits squarely on the modern identification edifice built by Pearl and successors. Pearl\u2019s SCMs and do-calculus formalize causal effects and identifiability, while the ID algorithm of Shpitser and Pearl, together with Tian\u2013Pearl\u2019s c-component factorization, provides the operative machinery and obstructions (e.g., hedges) that define when and why effects are not identifiable. The present work\u2019s key move is a principled elimination of functionally determined variables that preserves identifiability-relevant structure; this relies on latent-projection-style reasoning from Richardson\u2019s ADMG framework and Verma\u2013Pearl\u2019s insights into how marginalization induces bidirected edges and algebraic constraints. By removing functional nodes appropriately, the procedure can disrupt hedge configurations, converting previously unidentifiable targets into identifiable ones under the same do-calculus/ID machinery. Moreover, because deterministic children carry no information beyond their parents, the analysis shows when such variables need not be observed, tightening the observational burden without sacrificing identifiability. The completeness of do-calculus (Huang\u2013Valtorta) guarantees that any new identifications exposed by these eliminations are reachable by standard rules. Finally, the algorithmic flavor and soundness of removing deterministic structure reflect longstanding techniques from probabilistic graphical models (as synthesized by Darwiche) for exploiting determinism while preserving essential inferential properties, here specialized to the causal identification setting.",
