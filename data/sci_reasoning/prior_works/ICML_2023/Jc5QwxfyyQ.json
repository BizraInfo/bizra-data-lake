  "synthesis_narrative": "The core of data2vec 2.0 is an efficiency-driven refinement of the data2vec framework, which learns by predicting contextualized target representations from an EMA teacher. That foundational teacher\u2013student setup traces to momentum-based self-distillation, popularized by BYOL and rooted in Mean Teacher\u2019s EMA targets, giving data2vec a mechanism for generating rich, label-free supervisory signals. Building on this, the primary efficiency leap comes from importing MAE\u2019s asymmetric masking insight\u2014do not encode masked tokens and instead use a lightweight decoder\u2014while translating it from pixel reconstruction to regressing teacher features, and crucially doing so uniformly across vision, speech, and language. The paper further reduces cost by amortizing teacher computation: teacher representations (from the EMA network) are reused across student updates, a direct extension of the teacher-student lineage that cuts redundant forward passes. These design choices are validated against strong, modality-specific baselines that framed the efficiency targets: wav2vec 2.0 for speech and RoBERTa for language. In both cases, the prior methods\u2019 strong accuracy but heavy compute shaped the objective to match quality at dramatically lower pretraining time. Together, the lineage from data2vec\u2019s contextualized targets, MAE\u2019s asymmetric masking, and EMA-based self-distillation yields a unified, fast SSL learner that retains cross-modal generality without the compute burden of prior modality-specific approaches.",
