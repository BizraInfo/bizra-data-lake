  "synthesis_narrative": "Simplex Random Features (SimRFs) emerge squarely from the random-feature lineage inaugurated by Rahimi and Recht, who framed unbiased kernel approximation via Monte Carlo features. Within this framework, variance\u2014and hence MSE\u2014became the central bottleneck, prompting the orthogonally coupled sampling of Orthogonal Random Features (ORF), which demonstrated that geometric correlations between projection directions can markedly reduce estimator variance. Structured ORF (SORF) then showed these couplings could be made computationally cheap, shaping the cost profile that SimRFs aim to match while improving accuracy.\n\nA parallel development in scalable Transformers made the exponential dot-product (softmax) kernel a prime target for random-feature methods. Performers introduced positive random features (PRFs) that enable unbiased, linear-time softmax attention (FAVOR+), but still relied on independent or orthogonally coupled sampling, leaving room for further variance reduction. SimRFs directly address this by replacing orthogonality with simplex-based geometric coupling and proving it is MSE-optimal among weight-independent geometrically-coupled PRFs; their SimRFs+ variant further attains asymptotic optimality when norm\u2013direction couplings are allowed. The theoretical backbone for this leap is the Welch bound on cross-correlation: simplex (equiangular) frames attain this limit, thereby minimizing pairwise correlations and, consequently, estimator variance. The kernelized-attention perspective from linear Transformers crystallized the application stakes, but the core intellectual advance is the geometric-optimal coupling of random features that subsumes and surpasses ORF/PRF baselines while preserving their practical efficiency.",
