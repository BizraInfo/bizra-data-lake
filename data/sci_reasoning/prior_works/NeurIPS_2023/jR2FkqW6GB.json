  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014generalized equilibria defined by asymmetric regret constraints and characterized as polytopes that are attainable by regret-minimizing algorithms\u2014builds on two intertwined lines: learning-to-equilibrium via regret minimization and commitment/leadership outcomes in games. Aumann\u2019s correlated equilibrium and its linear constraints supply the polyhedral template; when both players enforce swap/internal regret, the generalized equilibrium collapses to the correlated equilibrium set. Hart and Mas-Colell\u2019s result that no-internal/swap-regret dynamics converge to correlated equilibrium provides the behavioral rationale for encoding equilibrium through regret constraints. Blum and Mansour\u2019s constructions for internal/swap (\u03c6-) regret ensure that these constraints can be met efficiently against arbitrary opponents, justifying the reachability claims.\nBlackwell\u2019s approachability theory, together with the Abernethy\u2013Bartlett\u2013Hazan equivalence between approachability and no-regret learning, furnishes the geometric machinery to treat regret targets as approachable convex sets, yielding the paper\u2019s polytope-of-feasible-values characterization and the existence of algorithms that realize any point within it. On the game-theoretic side, Conitzer and Sandholm\u2019s Stackelberg framework and von Stengel\u2013Zamir\u2019s analysis of leadership with mixed strategies ground the paper\u2019s key asymmetric case (one no-swap learner, one unconstrained opponent) as an extension of Stackelberg with matching value. By unifying these strands, the paper shows how altering regret constraints reshapes attainable payoffs, and explains why deviating from standard no-swap learning against a no-swap opponent can strictly improve utility in broad classes of games without pure Nash equilibria.",
