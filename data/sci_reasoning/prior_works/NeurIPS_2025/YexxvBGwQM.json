  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014demonstrating that explicit \u201cthinking\u201d is often unnecessary for rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) on visual perception tasks\u2014sits at the intersection of two influential threads: reinforcement-style alignment with non-human, rule-based rewards and the recent emphasis on explicit reasoning traces. InstructGPT established the RLHF optimization scaffold, while Constitutional AI proved that rule-driven supervision can supplant human preference models\u2014together setting the stage for RFT, where verifiable rules determine rewards. Self-Rewarding Language Models further validated that simple, automatically computed outcomes can effectively drive improvement, directly informing the paper\u2019s No-Thinking-RFT with an equality-accuracy reward.\n\nIn parallel, Chain-of-Thought and the \u201cLet\u2019s think step by step\u201d line of work encouraged exposing intermediate reasoning, and Self-Consistency suggested that richer process signals improve performance. These works fostered the community intuition that thinking traces are central to successful reinforcement-style tuning. The present paper challenges that assumption in the visual domain, showing that when rewards are verifiable (e.g., exact match/equality), optimizing the final outcome suffices and explicit thinking brings no consistent gains.\n\nFinally, LLaVA provided the practical MLLM substrate for extending Thinking-RFT to image classification and for broad empirical comparisons. By uniting the RLHF/RFT lineage of verifiable, rule-based rewards with the reasoning-centric literature, the paper isolates when process supervision matters\u2014and finds that for perception-oriented MLLM tasks, simple rule-based outcome rewards enable robust RFT without thinking.",
