  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s main advance\u2014showing diffusion models are nearly minimax-optimal distribution estimators in total variation and Wasserstein distances over Besov classes\u2014rests on two converging lines of work. On the modeling side, Hyv\u00e4rinen\u2019s score matching introduced the Fisher-divergence objective that diffusion training minimizes, and Vincent\u2019s denoising score matching made multi-noise score estimation practical, which became the precise empirical loss analyzed here. Sohl-Dickstein et al. then introduced diffusion probabilistic models with forward noising and reverse-time generation, while Song and Ermon operationalized score-based generative modeling via annealed denoising score matching and Langevin sampling; Song et al. further unified these approaches through the reverse-time SDE formulation. Together, these works define the exact training objective and generative dynamics whose approximation and generalization behavior this paper studies.\nOn the statistical side, classical nonparametric theory (Donoho, Johnstone, Kerkyacharian, and Picard) formalized Besov smoothness and minimax benchmarks in L1/TV, and Niles-Weed and Rigollet characterized minimax rates for smooth densities in Wasserstein distance. These results specify the target optimal rates and low-dimensional adaptation regimes that modern generative models should meet. By marrying the score-based diffusion framework with Besov-space minimax theory, the present paper proves that minimizing empirical score matching yields generators attaining nearly minimax rates in TV and W1 and adapts to low intrinsic dimension\u2014closing a central theoretical gap left open by prior diffusion model work.",
