  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014an exact characterization of learnability with improving agents, including proper and online regimes via conservative, minimally consistent classifiers\u2014sits at the intersection of strategic behavior and classical learning theory. It is most immediately grounded in Attias et al.\u2019s formulation of learning with improvements, which revealed that agent effort to genuinely improve can shrink generalization error relative to standard PAC learning. Building from this, the authors replace broad, arbitrary improvement regions with structure that allows for exact characterizations, showing when conservative learners suffice.\n\nThis agenda connects back to strategic classification (Hardt et al.), which established how agents react to classifiers, and to performative prediction (Perdomo et al.), which formalized model-induced distribution shifts and equilibria. Together they motivate analyzing decision rules that remain stable once deployed, clarifying why conservative classification\u2014erring on restraint in granting positives\u2014can consistently perform well when agents respond by improving rather than gaming.\n\nOn the learning-theoretic side, the work leverages classical notions of minimal consistency and one-inclusion reasoning (Haussler\u2013Littlestone\u2013Warmuth) to craft an asymmetric minimal-consistency framework that matches the directional nature of improvements. For the online component, Littlestone\u2019s mistake-bound theory provides the canonical characterization that the authors adapt to the improvement setting, aligning conservative prediction schemes with low-mistake guarantees. Finally, incentive-aware modeling of effort (Kleinberg\u2013Raghavan) grounds the improvement regions behaviorally, reinforcing the paper\u2019s premise that appropriately conservative classifiers can both incentivize and benefit from genuine agent improvements while admitting precise statistical and online characterizations.",
