  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014characterizing the feasible reward set that rationalizes a given equilibrium in Markov games and resolving equilibrium ambiguity via entropy regularization\u2014sits at the intersection of inverse reinforcement learning, game theory, and regularized control. Littman\u2019s formulation of Markov games established the equilibrium-based substrate necessary to speak about reward rationalizability in multi-agent settings. Ng and Russell\u2019s IRL introduced the identifiability problem, showing many rewards can explain the same behavior, a tension that Abbeel and Ng operationalized via linear optimality constraints that describe the entire set of rewards making an expert policy optimal. The present paper generalizes this feasible-set view from single-agent policies to multi-agent equilibria, replacing optimality constraints with equilibrium constraints.\nTo disambiguate multiple equilibria consistent with demonstrations, the authors invoke entropy regularization. Ziebart\u2019s maximum entropy IRL provided the blueprint for using entropy to select a unique, behaviorally plausible solution in the face of ambiguity, while McKelvey and Palfrey\u2019s quantal response equilibria established an entropy-regularized equilibrium concept in games that typically ensures uniqueness and preserves strategic incentives. Finally, the paper\u2019s finite-sample analysis builds on two strands: Syed and Schapire\u2019s game-theoretic apprenticeship learning, which ties feature-matching error to policy performance, and Geist et al.\u2019s theory of regularized MDPs, which quantifies performance loss under entropy regularization. Together, these works directly enable a principled characterization of feasible rewards in Markov games, a uniqueness-inducing entropy-regularized variant, and performance guarantees for MAIRL.",
