  "synthesis_narrative": "BRO\u2019s core advance\u2014scaling critic capacity while maintaining sample and compute efficiency through heavy regularization and optimistic exploration\u2014sits squarely on three intertwined lines of prior work. First, SAC established a robust, off-policy, maximum-entropy actor-critic foundation for continuous control, while TD3 clarified how overestimation bias and target smoothing impact actor-critic stability. These two works provide the algorithmic substrate and the bias-control principles that BRO must preserve as it enlarges the critic. Second, ensemble- and uncertainty-driven exploration emerged from Bootstrapped DQN, showing that optimism grounded in value uncertainty can materially improve exploration efficiency; BRO operationalizes this idea in continuous control by coupling optimism with a strong SAC/TD3-style backbone. Third, a series of regularization insights made scaling feasible: DrQ demonstrated that simple but strong regularizers (e.g., augmentations) can vastly improve stability and sample efficiency, and CQL formalized how penalizing Q-values curbs overestimation when function capacity grows or data are sparse. Complementing these, distributional RL via QR-DQN provides a principled lens for reducing value overestimation and capturing uncertainty\u2014key when training larger critics. By fusing these ingredients\u2014SAC/TD3\u2019s stability, ensemble-based optimism, and strong critic regularization\u2014BRO shows that bigger, well-regularized critics can be an asset, not a liability, yielding state-of-the-art, sample-efficient continuous control.",
