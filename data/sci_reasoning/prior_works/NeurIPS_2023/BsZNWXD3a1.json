  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014automatically adapting user prompts into model-preferred prompts for text-to-image generation via supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning\u2014draws from three converging lines of work. First, diffusion-based text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al.) created a setting where prompt wording is highly consequential, furnishing both the application context and the evaluation bedrock. Second, the vision\u2013language ecosystem established reliable proxy signals. CLIPScore (Hessel et al.) offered a reference-free text\u2013image alignment metric to preserve user intent, while LAION\u2019s CLIP-based aesthetic predictor operationalized visual appeal; together they enable a composite, differentiable-in-spirit but black-box reward to guide prompt search. Third, research on prompt learning showed that model-preferred prompts can be learned rather than hand-crafted. AutoPrompt (Shin et al.) proved automatic discrete prompt engineering can outperform manual prompts, and CoOp (Zhou et al.) extended the concept to vision\u2013language models, demonstrating the benefits of model-specific prompting. Complementing these, Prompt Tuning (Lester et al.) showed small supervised datasets can effectively shape prompts, informing the paper\u2019s initial supervised fine-tuning on curated prompt pairs. Finally, the SFT\u2192RL pipeline is inspired by InstructGPT (Ouyang et al.), replacing human preference models with image-specific proxy rewards. Together, these works directly underpin the paper\u2019s design: learn an initial textual prompt adapter with SFT, then use RL to explore higher-reward prompts balancing aesthetics and faithfulness for Stable Diffusion.",
