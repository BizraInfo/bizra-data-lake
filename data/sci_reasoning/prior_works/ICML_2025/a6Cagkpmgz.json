  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014single-loop stochastic smoothed primal\u2013dual algorithms for nonconvex problems with linear inequality constraints\u2014rests on three pillars unified into one framework. First, Davis and Drusvyatskiy\u2019s Moreau-envelope perspective for weakly convex objectives enables treating nonconvexity via inexact gradient descent on a smooth envelope; the present work adapts this idea to constrained problems by estimating the envelope gradient with just one linearized augmented Lagrangian (primal\u2013dual) step. This primal\u2013dual step is grounded in classic ALM and proximal point principles (Rockafellar) and modern nonconvex primal\u2013dual theory (Hong\u2013Luo\u2013Razaviyayn), ensuring that a single stochastic update meaningfully approximates the proximal/envelope map while handling Lagrange multipliers for inequalities.\nSecond, the analysis of inequality constraints hinges on global error bounds: the Hoffman bound provides a quantitative link between residuals and distance to feasibility for linear systems, while Luo\u2013Tseng\u2013style error bound theory informs how residuals translate into stationarity guarantees. By combining these bounds with Moreau-envelope arguments, the paper derives convergence to approximate KKT points without projections.\nThird, the sample complexity targets are calibrated against nonconvex stochastic benchmarks: Ghadimi\u2013Lan\u2019s O(\u03b5^-4) rate and the near-optimal O(\u03b5^-3) rates from SPIDER. By integrating variance-reduction-style gradient estimation ideas into the envelope/primal\u2013dual estimator, the paper attains O(\u03b5^-4) and O(\u03b5^-3) sample complexities in their respective algorithmic regimes. Together, these strands yield a projection-free, single-loop stochastic primal\u2013dual method with optimal rates for inequality-constrained nonconvex optimization.",
