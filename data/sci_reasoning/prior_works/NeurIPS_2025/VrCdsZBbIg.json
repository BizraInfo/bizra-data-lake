  "synthesis_narrative": "Genesys\u2019s core contribution\u2014an LLM-driven, multi-agent system that proposes, critiques, implements, trains, and evaluates novel LM designs with a Ladder of Scales\u2014stands on three converging lines of prior work. First, scaling-law research by Kaplan et al. and the compute-optimal perspective of Hoffmann et al. directly motivate Genesys\u2019s progressive verification: run many cheap small-scale trials, then advance only the most promising designs to larger models under a tightening compute budget. This turns empirical scaling regularities into an explicit experiment-allocation policy.\nSecond, Genesys\u2019s \u201cgenetic programming backbone\u201d traces to evolutionary architecture/algorithm discovery. Regularized evolution (Real et al., 2019) establishes robust mutation\u2013selection loops for neural design, while AutoML-Zero (Real et al., 2020) shows that executable ML programs can be evolved end-to-end. Genesys adapts these ideas to LLM-mediated code generation for LM components, arguing this evolutionary substrate reliably yields runnable, high-quality designs relative to single-shot prompting. PromptBreeder extends this by demonstrating LLM-in-the-loop genetic operators for textual artifacts, informing Genesys\u2019s mutation, crossover, and self-referential improvements.\nThird, the system-level orchestration draws from multi-agent LLM frameworks and adversarial critique. CAMEL-style role specialization maps naturally onto research roles (proposer, reviewer, implementer, verifier), and debate-inspired adversarial reviewing (Irving et al.) provides a principled mechanism to stress-test proposals before expensive training. Together, these threads produce a closed-loop, compute-aware discovery pipeline in which LLMs not only propose but systematically winnow and validate LM architectures.",
