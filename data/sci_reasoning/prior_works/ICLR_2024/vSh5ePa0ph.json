  "synthesis_narrative": "A line of work on in-context learning in linear settings established both the experimental setup and the algorithms that emerge. Aky\u00fcrek et al. (2022) defined the synthetic meta-pretraining distribution of linear regression tasks with Gaussian-distributed parameters and documented that transformers learn an in-context algorithm closely resembling classical regression, creating the canonical linear-ICL benchmark. Building on this, Aky\u00fcrek et al. (2023) showed mechanistically that attention can implement gradient-descent-style updates from the context when trained on such tasks, clarifying how an algorithm emerges inside the model. In parallel, the Bayesian perspective was sharpened by Xie et al. (2023), who argued that ICL amounts to implicit Bayesian inference; in the linear\u2013Gaussian case this reduces to the ridge-regression predictor, a link grounded in the classic ridge formulation of Hoerl and Kennard (1970). Beyond mechanism, meta-learning theory by Baxter (2000) introduced task-sample complexity notions for learning inductive bias across tasks, while Tripuraneni et al. (2021) provided finite-sample guarantees for meta-learning in linear models, relating the number of tasks to out-of-task generalization. Taken together, these works suggested a precise opportunity: analyze a minimal attention model trained on linear\u2013Gaussian tasks and characterize how many tasks suffice for it to internalize the Bayes-optimal (ridge) predictor. The current paper synthesizes these insights by proving a statistical task-complexity bound for pretraining a single-layer linear-attention model and showing it achieves nearly Bayes-optimal risk on unseen tasks of fixed context length, thereby converting the heuristic Bayesian/GD narratives into sharp guarantees.",

In this paper, we study ICL in one of its simplest setups: pretraining a single-layer linear attention model for linear regression with a Gaussian prior. We establish a statistical task complexity bound for the attention model pretraining, showing that effective pretraining only requires a small number of independent tasks. Furthermore, we prove that the pretrained model closely matches the Bayes optimal algorithm, i.e., optimally tuned ridge regression, by achieving nearly Bayes optimal risk on unseen tasks under a fixed context length. These theoretical findings complement prior experimental research and shed light on the statistical foundations of ICL.",
