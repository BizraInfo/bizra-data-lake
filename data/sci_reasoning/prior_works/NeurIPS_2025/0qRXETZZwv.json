  "synthesis_narrative": "MERIT sits at the intersection of decision theory, robust optimization, and practical policy debates on randomized selection. From decision theory, von Neumann\u2019s minimax theorem legitimizes randomization when facing an adversarial or ambiguous environment, while Gilboa\u2013Schmeidler\u2019s maxmin expected utility provides the precise objective MERIT optimizes: the worst\u2011case expected hit rate of true top\u2011k selections under non\u2011singleton beliefs. Robust optimization, particularly the Ben\u2011Tal\u2013Nemirovski framework and the Bertsimas\u2013Sim tractable treatments of interval uncertainty, informs MERIT\u2019s modeling of overlapping confidence intervals as uncertainty sets and the derivation of a polynomial\u2011time, practically efficient algorithm. Classical robust discrete optimization (Kouvelis\u2013Yu) contributes structural insights for handling min\u2013max objectives over combinatorial selection spaces, which MERIT adapts to allow mixed (randomized) policies rather than purely deterministic choices.\n\nOn the application side, the literature advocating lotteries in science funding (Avin; Fang & Casadevall) identifies both the prevalence of evaluation noise and the appeal of randomness but lacks a principled objective and mechanism design. MERIT closes this gap by specifying an interpretable robustness criterion\u2014maximize worst\u2011case expected inclusion of the true top\u2011k\u2014and constructing the optimal randomized allocation consistent with interval uncertainty. Together, these strands directly shape MERIT\u2019s core innovation: a principled, axiomatic, and computationally tractable randomized top\u2011k selection rule that supersedes ad hoc lottery practices.",
