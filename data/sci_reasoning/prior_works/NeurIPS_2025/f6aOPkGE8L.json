  "synthesis_narrative": "UniTok\u2019s central insight is that the apparent conflict between reconstruction (generative tokenizers) and semantic supervision (contrastive understanding) is not intrinsic to the objectives; it emerges from the limited capacity of discrete token spaces. This view is grounded in the VQ-VAE lineage. VQ-VAE established discrete tokenization for images, while VQ-VAE-2 showed that increasing latent capacity through hierarchical quantization boosts fidelity\u2014hinting that capacity, not the loss type, is the bottleneck. DALL\u00b7E operationalized discrete VAEs as tokenizers for autoregressive generation, setting a strong precedent for the generative use case UniTok must satisfy. On the understanding side, CLIP introduced powerful image\u2013text contrastive supervision, and BEiT demonstrated that discrete visual tokens can drive discriminative pretraining. Attempts to combine these threads often reported loss interference; UniTok reframes this as a capacity issue and resolves it by scaling the discrete bottleneck.\n\nThe mechanism UniTok adopts\u2014multi-codebook quantization\u2014directly draws on evidence that multiple quantizers increase representational power, as seen in multi-level/residual quantization used in Jukebox. Conceptually, it also aligns with product quantization\u2019s factorization of latent spaces to realize large effective vocabularies without exploding codebook size. By expanding both vocabulary and bottleneck dimensionality via multiple codebooks, UniTok supports accurate reconstruction and rich semantics simultaneously, enabling a single tokenizer to serve visual generation and understanding, and achieving state-of-the-art rFID and zero-shot accuracy.",
