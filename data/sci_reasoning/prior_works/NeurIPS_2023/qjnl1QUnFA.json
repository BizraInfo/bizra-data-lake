  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of High-Fidelity Audio Compression with Improved RVQGAN is a universal, high-rate-efficiency audio tokenizer/decoder that preserves 44.1 kHz fidelity at ~8 kbps by combining residual vector quantization with adversarial and spectral reconstruction losses. This builds fundamentally on VQ-VAE, which introduced discrete codebooks enabling token-based modeling. From the image domain, VQGAN demonstrated that adversarial and perceptual objectives can dramatically improve reconstructions of vector-quantized autoencoders; the paper adapts this philosophy to audio while pairing it with residual quantizers.\nIn audio compression specifically, SoundStream established residual vector quantization with GAN training as a practical, universal codec paradigm; Improved RVQGAN inherits RVQ and adversarial training but strengthens codebook usage and loss design for 44.1 kHz and stricter bitrates. EnCodec then pushed fidelity with multi-band RVQ and strong adversarial/spectral losses, serving as the immediate benchmark and design template that this work refines and surpasses.\nThe adversarial and reconstruction objectives are grounded in HiFi-GAN\u2019s multi-scale/period discriminator and feature-matching strategies, and in the multi-resolution STFT loss popularized by Parallel WaveGAN\u2014both critical to minimizing artifacts while preserving timbre and transients. Finally, Jukebox showed the value of discrete high-fidelity audio tokens at 44.1 kHz for generative modeling, motivating a universal codec that can feed language models across speech, music, and environmental sound. Together, these works directly scaffold the paper\u2019s improved RVQGAN, yielding high-fidelity, low-bitrate, universal audio tokens.",
