  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014making token-based multimodal protein language models robust for structure modeling\u2014stands on a lineage that began with discretizing protein geometry. trRosetta established discrete structural targets (distograms and orientations), which, together with Foldseek\u2019s 3Di structural alphabet, defined practical structural tokens widely used for integrating 3D into learning systems; these are exactly the tokens whose fidelity limitations the paper diagnoses as tokenization loss. To overcome this, the paper imports two key architectural and supervision ideas. From AlphaFold and GVP-GNN, it borrows geometry-aware representations\u2014residue frames and scalar\u2013vector channels\u2014to make the multimodal PLM structurally cognizant, directly improving structure-token prediction and representation learning. From ByT5, it adapts the principle that finer-grained supervision alleviates tokenization errors, instantiating bitwise modeling of structure tokens and hybrid data-space objectives that tie discrete tokens back to continuous coordinates. The need for these advances is sharpened by the success of continuous SE(3)-equivariant generative models, exemplified by diffusion models for protein backbones, which highlight the gap in fidelity and diversity between discrete-token models and continuous approaches. Finally, the demonstrated sequence\u2013structure coupling power in ProteinMPNN informs the paper\u2019s multimodal objectives and evaluation, with the proposed design space yielding improved structure generation diversity and folding ability while retaining the efficiency and scalability advantages of token-based PLMs.",
