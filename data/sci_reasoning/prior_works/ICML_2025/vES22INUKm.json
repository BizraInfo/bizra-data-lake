  "synthesis_narrative": "The core contribution\u2014end-to-end error analysis of flow-matched continuous normalizing flows with Wasserstein-2 convergence guarantees\u2014rests on a lineage that unifies modeling, training, and geometric analysis. Neural ODEs (Chen et al.) and FFJORD (Grathwohl et al.) created the CNF framework and tractable training machinery, giving the model class whose error the present paper studies. Flow Matching (Lipman et al.) then proposed supervising CNFs by regressing to constructed velocity fields; this paper targets exactly that objective and addresses its major open limitation by proving distributional convergence and rates. The stochastic-interpolant view (Albergo & Vanden-Eijnden) crystallized regression to time-dependent vector fields along paths between source and target distributions, directly inspiring the FM-style supervision signals the analysis formalizes. On the theoretical side, the dynamic optimal transport formulation of Benamou & Brenier and the Wasserstein calculus developed by Ambrosio\u2013Gigli\u2013Savar\u00e9 provide the continuity-equation and W2-geometric tools to track how learned velocities move probability mass and to bound generative error. Finally, the probability-flow ODE perspective from score-based diffusion (Song et al.) informs the ODE-based proof strategy and motivates the mild Lipschitz score assumption under which the paper derives improved rates. Together, these works directly enabled the paper\u2019s main result: rigorous W2 convergence guarantees for FM-trained CNFs, with sharper rates under natural score regularity.",
