  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014a similarity-aware evaluation framework for drug\u2013target affinity prediction\u2014emerges directly from the lineage that defined similarity as central to DTI/DTA and from benchmarks that exposed the pitfalls of random splitting. Yamanishi et al. established the foundational formulation of DTI as learning across chemical and genomic similarity spaces, making similarity the natural axis for generalization. Building on that ecosystem, Pahikkala et al. (KronRLS/KIBA) and DeepDTA became standard baselines reported largely under random or weakly constrained splits; these practices created the precise overestimation the paper diagnoses when test samples resemble training data. Parallel advances in benchmarking emphasized similarity-aware evaluation: MoleculeNet popularized scaffold splits to reduce molecular structure leakage, while TAPE showed that stringent protein sequence-identity control is essential for assessing remote homology generalization. OGB further normalized scaffold-based splits across graph benchmarks, highlighting that domain-informed splits materially change conclusions. Yet TDC\u2019s widely adopted warm/cold drug/target/both splits remain coarse, lacking continuous control over similarity distributions. The present work unifies and extends these threads: it explicitly quantifies compound and protein similarity, formulates train/test partitioning as an optimization problem to match any desired similarity profile, and re-benchmarks canonical DTA models to reveal their sharp degradation on low-similarity regimes\u2014thereby addressing a critical gap left by heuristic or categorical split protocols.",
