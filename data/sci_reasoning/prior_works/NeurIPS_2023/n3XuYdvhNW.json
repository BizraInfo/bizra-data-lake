  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s central idea\u2014approximating squared Wasserstein distance by transporting along an optimally chosen one-dimensional projection and interpreting the result through generalized geodesics\u2014rests on two pillars: geodesic theory in Wasserstein space and efficient 1D OT computations via slicing. Ambrosio\u2013Gigli\u2013Savar\u00e9\u2019s formulation of generalized geodesics provides the exact conceptual scaffold for using a pivot measure; by constraining the pivot to lie on a line, the authors obtain a tractable specialization that explains the geometry of their proxy and justifies an upper-bound relation to the true WD. McCann\u2019s displacement interpolation further legitimizes constructing transport maps along geodesic paths, which min-SWGG emulates by inducing a map after an optimal projection.\nOn the algorithmic side, Bonneel\u2013Peyr\u00e9\u2013Cuturi\u2019s sliced-Wasserstein machinery established that projecting onto 1D, sorting, and aggregating yields SW with O(n log n) complexity; min-SWGG preserves this efficiency but, unlike standard SW, recovers a transport plan. Santambrogio\u2019s 1D monotone rearrangement formula is pivotal for the paper\u2019s closed-form result when one distribution lies on a line, enabling the fast scheme and differentiability. Projection optimization ideas popularized by Paty\u2013Cuturi\u2019s Subspace Robust Wasserstein distances inspire the search over directions; however, min-SWGG inverts the aim\u2014minimizing to get an upper bound and a plan instead of maximizing for a lower bound. Finally, Cuturi\u2019s Sinkhorn distances serve as the computational and practical benchmark: min-SWGG targets a complementary regime with SW-like speed yet with transport plans, making it suitable for gradient-based learning while tightening the link to true OT through its geodesic interpretation.",
