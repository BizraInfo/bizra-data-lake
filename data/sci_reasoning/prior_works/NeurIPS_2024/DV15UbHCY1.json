  "synthesis_narrative": "Tan et al.\u2019s central claim\u2014that LLM components bring little to no benefit for time series forecasting\u2014builds directly on the surge of LLM-for-TS methods and on strong TS-specific baselines. Time-LLM and GPT4TS epitomize the idea of adapting or instruction-tuning general-purpose LLMs for forecasting; by reconstructing these systems and systematically removing their LLM backbones, the authors show that performance is unchanged or improved, directly contesting these methods\u2019 core assumptions. In parallel, the foundation-model narrative advanced by Chronos and TimeGPT-1, which promotes language-style tokenization and large-scale pretraining for time series, motivates the paper\u2019s pretraining ablations. The authors find that pretraining confers no consistent gains over training from scratch, challenging the transfer-learning promise central to these works.\nCrucially, the paper anchors its critique in strong non-LLM architectures. PatchTST demonstrates that patching is a powerful inductive bias for TS, while iTransformer exemplifies effective attention structures tailored to TS. Tan et al. leverage these insights to show that patching plus basic attention can match or surpass LLM-based approaches. Finally, the DLinear study\u2019s lesson\u2014that simpler components are competitive\u2014shapes the authors\u2019 ablation philosophy and interpretation: complexity from LLMs is not inherently beneficial for forecasting. Collectively, these prior works provided the concrete LLM targets, the pretraining hypothesis to test, and the TS-specific architectural baselines that enabled Tan et al.\u2019s decisive negative result and practical guidance.",
