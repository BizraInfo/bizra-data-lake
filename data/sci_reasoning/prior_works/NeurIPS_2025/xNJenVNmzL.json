  "synthesis_narrative": "PiKE sits at the intersection of multi-task optimization and large-scale data mixture design. Early MTL work framed the problem as multi-objective optimization (MGDA), combining task gradients to guarantee descent, which established the importance of gradient geometry. Subsequent methods\u2014PCGrad, CAGrad, and Nash-MTL\u2014primarily addressed destructive interference by projecting, constraining, or bargaining over conflicting gradients. In parallel, adaptive weighting methods like GradNorm dynamically balanced losses using gradient magnitudes rather than the geometry of inter-task interactions. On the data side, multilingual and multi-domain pretraining practice relied on heuristic temperature-based sampling to rebalance datasets, while more recent approaches like DoReMi learned data mixtures via teacher-guided distribution reweighting.\nPiKE\u2019s key insight is that many large-scale pretraining settings exhibit low gradient conflict, shifting the optimization bottleneck from avoiding interference to exploiting synergy. It formalizes this shift by deriving a near-tight upper bound on average loss decrease that depends on gradient inner products across tasks, and then adapts task sampling weights to maximize this bound with negligible overhead. Conceptually, PiKE marries MGDA\u2019s descent-centric reasoning with the practical need for scalable data mixing, replacing conflict mitigation (PCGrad/CAGrad/Nash-MTL) and heuristic or teacher-driven mixture design (temperature sampling/DoReMi) with a single, gradient-interaction-driven rule. The result is a principled, efficient scheduler that leverages positive gradient interactions to accelerate multi-task pretraining while retaining theoretical convergence guarantees.",
