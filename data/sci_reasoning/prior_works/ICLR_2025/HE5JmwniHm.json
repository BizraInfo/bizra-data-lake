  "synthesis_narrative": "DLEFT-MKC fuses three influential trajectories: late-fusion clustering, multi-view/kernel consistency learning, and robust tensor low-rank modeling within a principled min\u2013max optimization framework. Early partition-level late fusion (Strehl & Ghosh, 2002; Fred & Jain, 2005) demonstrated how to combine base clusterings efficiently via co-association, but these methods treat base partitions as fixed, limiting adaptivity. DLEFT-MKC retains the computational advantages of late fusion while making a key leap: it dynamically optimizes base partition matrices during fusion, overcoming the performance ceiling imposed by static inputs.\nThe kernel k-means/spectral connection (Dhillon et al., 2004) and co-regularized multi-view clustering (Kumar et al., 2011) established how kernelized views can be aligned via shared structure or consistency terms; DLEFT-MKC builds on this by learning kernel/view weights and, crucially, capturing high-order cross-view dependencies. This is enabled by tensor modeling based on the t-product framework (Kilmer et al., 2013), which provides the algebraic machinery for representing multi-view relations as a low-rank tensor, and by TRPCA (Lu et al., 2019), which stabilizes learning under noise and distributional heterogeneity.\nFinally, to couple dynamic partition refinement, adaptive weighting, and robust tensor regularization, DLEFT-MKC casts learning as a nonconvex\u2013nonconcave minimax problem, drawing on recent gradient descent\u2013ascent advances (Lin et al., 2020). The result is a dynamic late-fusion MKC method that is both near-linear in practice and robust, extracting comprehensive multi-kernel information via high-order tensor correlations while adapting to varied data distributions.",
