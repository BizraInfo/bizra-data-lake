  "synthesis_narrative": "Aamand et al. advance frequency estimation by rethinking how sketch space should be allocated between heavy and light items, both with and without predictions. The classical Count-Min Sketch (Cormode\u2013Muthukrishnan) and CountSketch (Charikar\u2013Chen\u2013Farach-Colton) provide the canonical l1- and l2-oriented baselines; these works formalized point-query error as a function of shared collisions and variance, and established the now-standard memory\u2013accuracy trade-offs. Heavy-hitter methods such as Misra\u2013Gries and the Space-Saving algorithm demonstrated that explicitly isolating frequent items can dramatically reduce interference among counts, a structural idea that Aamand et al. leverage: by separating heavy elements (whether identified algorithmically or via an oracle) from the \u201clight\u201d tail, the new sketch concentrates resources where collisions most affect error.\n\nBuilding on the emerging learning-augmented paradigm, Hsu et al. (2019) introduced frequency estimation tailored by a learned heavy-hitter oracle. Aamand et al. directly engage this line: first, they give a novel, prediction-free sketch whose worst-case guarantees surpass Hsu et al.\u2019s learned method in certain parameter regimes; second, they augment their sketch with the same heavy-hitter prediction to achieve strictly improved error bounds. The robustness perspective of Lykouris\u2013Vassilvitskii informs their guarantees: predictions help when accurate but do not undermine worst-case correctness. Together, these prior works shape the paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014a principled heavy/light decomposition that yields tighter theoretical error and practical gains, and a clean pathway to further improvements when reliable heavy-hitter predictions are available.",
