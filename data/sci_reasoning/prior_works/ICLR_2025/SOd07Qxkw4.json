  "synthesis_narrative": "Noise-conditioned score modeling established that one can learn \u2207 log p\u03c3 at multiple noise levels, providing a concrete setup for approximate scores that can be quantified across time. Building on this, the stochastic differential equation formulation of score-based generative modeling introduced the probability flow ODE, a deterministic dynamic that shares marginals with the diffusion SDE and naturally invites ODE-based numerical analysis. DDIM then showed that deterministic non-Markovian updates trace probability flow ODE trajectories, sharpening the focus on ODE samplers as a practical and analyzable path for generation. In parallel, numerical advances demonstrated that higher-order ODE solvers\u2014particularly second-order schemes\u2014can dramatically cut function evaluations when integrating the probability flow ODE. From the sampling-theory side, the randomized midpoint method was proposed to reduce bias and improve complexity for log-concave targets by randomizing the evaluation time in a midpoint integrator. Most recently, this randomized midpoint idea was carried over to diffusion models, yielding the then-best iteration complexity O(d^{5/12} \u03b5^{-1}).\nThese threads together exposed a clear opportunity: combine the ODE viewpoint of diffusion sampling with a theoretically principled high-order, randomized integrator while explicitly accounting for \u03b5-accurate learned scores and avoiding log-concavity. By refining the randomized midpoint analysis on the probability flow ODE and calibrating randomized step sizes (learning rates) to balance discretization and score approximation errors, the present work achieves a sharper complexity of O(d^{1/3} \u03b5^{-2/3}) under weaker assumptions, a natural next step given the prior landscape.",

    "abstract": "Score-based diffusion models have achieved remarkable empirical performance in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence for their ability to generate high-quality new data instances from complex distributions. Improving our understanding of diffusion models, including mainly convergence analysis for such models, has attracted a lot of interests. Despite a lot of theoretical attempts, there still exists significant gap between theory and practice. Towards to close this gap, we establish an iteration complexity at the order of $d^{1/3}\\varepsilon^{-2/3}$, which is better than $d^{5/12}\\varepsilon^{-1}$, the best known complexity achieved before our work. This convergence analysis is based on a randomized midpoint method, which is first proposed for log-concave sampling (Shen & Lee, 2019), and then extended to diffusion models by Gupta et al. (2024). Our theory accommodates $\\varepsilon$-accurate score estimates, and does not require log-concavity on the target distributi",
