  "synthesis_narrative": "JKOnet*\u2019s core idea is to recast learning diffusion dynamics as identifying the free-energy functional that generates a Wasserstein gradient flow. This pivot traces directly to the Jordan\u2013Kinderlehrer\u2013Otto (JKO) scheme, which views diffusion as successive variational proximal steps in Wasserstein space. Ambrosio\u2013Gigli\u2013Savar\u00e9 provided the rigorous optimality conditions and convergence properties of these steps, allowing JKOnet* to derive a simple quadratic objective from the Euler\u2013Lagrange equations of a single JKO update and thereby sidestep the bilevel inner optimization typical of prior approaches. Otto\u2019s geometric interpretation of dissipative PDEs in Wasserstein space clarifies how parametrizing the energy functional\u2014rather than the drift\u2014yields identifiable structures and admits closed-form solutions when the energy is linear in parameters.\nCrucially, Carrillo\u2013McCann\u2013Villani\u2019s decomposition of free energy into potential, interaction, and internal (entropic/porous) components guides JKOnet*\u2019s representational design: the model learns each component from data, enabling interpretable recovery of the underlying diffusion process. While the Benamou\u2013Brenier dynamic formulation of optimal transport historically enabled computational access to Wasserstein distances, JKOnet* leverages the same variational machinery but collapses the learning problem to least-squares via first-order conditions, avoiding expensive inner OT solves. Finally, diffusion and score-based generative models (Ho et al.; Song et al.) motivated the departure from drift-only estimation: by learning the full energy functional that induces drift and diffusion, JKOnet* attains superior sample efficiency, accuracy, and closed-form estimators for linear parametrizations, delivering \u201clightspeed\u201d learning of diffusion processes.",
