  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014formal reranking laws for language generation\u2014sits at the intersection of long-standing reranking practice in NLP and foundational communication theory. On the NLP side, discriminative N-best reranking (Collins & Koo) and, more recently, self-consistency for chain-of-thought (Wang et al.) established the practical paradigm: generate many hypotheses and select the best. Diverse beam search (Vijayakumar et al.) further highlighted that correlations among candidates materially affect downstream selection, foreshadowing the paper\u2019s explicit analysis of statistical dependence among channels.\nOn the theory side, Shannon\u2019s formulation of reliable communication via redundancy provides the conceptual backbone: multiple samples act as redundant transmissions that can drive error to zero under suitable conditions. The analogy tightens through the lens of selection combining and diversity reception (Simon & Alouini), where a receiver chooses the most reliable branch; this maps naturally to a reranker choosing the most reliable hypothesis and motivates studying gains and limitations under dependent channels.\nTo rigorously capture imperfections in the selection process, the paper adopts classical ranking noise models: the Mallows distribution furnishes a principled, distance-based probabilistic model over permutations, while Zipf\u2013Mandelbrot rank-frequency behavior captures heavy-tailed ranking errors. Together, these works directly enable the paper\u2019s central results: precise, asymptotic conditions under which multi-sample generation with an imperfect reranker becomes effectively error-free\u2014even when hypotheses are statistically dependent\u2014thereby unifying empirical reranking practice with communication-theoretic guarantees.",
