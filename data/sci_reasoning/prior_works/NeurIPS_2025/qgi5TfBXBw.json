  "synthesis_narrative": "Offline RL\u2019s central challenge\u2014extrapolation error from out-of-distribution actions\u2014has been addressed along three main lines: density constraints, support constraints, and sample constraints. BRAC (density/KL regularization) and TD3+BC (BC regularization) exemplify density-control approaches that keep the learned policy close to the behavior policy but can be overly conservative when the dataset is suboptimal. BEAR advanced support-aware learning by constraining divergence to the dataset\u2019s support, while BCQ operationalized a concrete support constraint via a generative model and small perturbations around dataset actions; both, however, rely on accurate behavior or generative modeling. Sample-constrained methods like IQL and safety-oriented SPIBB restrict learning to in-dataset actions (or well-supported state-action pairs), improving stability yet often limiting improvement due to their conservatism.\n\nThe proposed adaptive neighborhood-constrained Q-learning synthesizes these insights by relocating the constraint to the Bellman target and defining the admissible action set as the union of local neighborhoods around dataset actions. This design directly inherits BCQ\u2019s intuition of staying near data but removes the need for behavior policy or generative modeling, addressing BEAR/BRAC\u2019s dependence on divergence estimation. By expanding beyond pure in-sample backups (IQL/SPIBB) to small, adaptive neighborhoods, it mitigates conservatism while still bounding extrapolation and distribution shift. Relative to pessimistic value regularization (CQL), it provides an explicit geometric control of OOD exposure rather than uniform underestimation. Collectively, these prior works motivate a constraint that is local, data-driven, and placed in the target backup, yielding a flexible yet theoretically grounded approximation to the ideal support constraint.",
