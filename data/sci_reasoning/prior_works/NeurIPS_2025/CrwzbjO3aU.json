  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014showing that under persistent uncertainty, regularized multi-agent learning in strongly monotone games exhibits recurrence with finite return times and a sharply concentrated long-run distribution near equilibrium\u2014builds on, and departs from, three main intellectual threads. First, Rosen\u2019s monotonicity theory provides the structural backbone: strong monotonicity ensures a unique, well-conditioned Nash equilibrium and yields the cocoercivity/strong monotonicity properties that the authors exploit to craft Lyapunov functions and stability inequalities. Second, deterministic regularized learning in games (e.g., Mertikopoulos\u2013Sandholm) and operator-theoretic stochastic approximation for monotone variational inequalities (e.g., Nemirovski et al.) supply the algorithmic and analytical scaffolding\u2014mirror/regularized updates and variational-inequality formulations\u2014while largely assuming full information or vanishing step-sizes. The present work pivots to the constant step-size, noisy regime where convergence fails, reframing the objective to recurrence and distributional concentration. Third, the study leverages ergodic theory for Markov processes (Meyn\u2013Tweedie) to obtain drift-based recurrence and return-time bounds, and draws conceptual and technical parallels with noisy game dynamics (Fudenberg\u2013Harris) and stationary distributions in perturbed best-response/logit dynamics (Blume). Finally, recent nonasymptotic analyses of noisy gradient dynamics (Raginsky et al.) inform how to quantify concentration of invariant measures, which the authors extend from optimization to multi-agent, strongly monotone interactions. This synthesis yields a precise, quantitative picture of long-run play under uncertainty and clarifies when these properties break down beyond strong monotonicity.",
