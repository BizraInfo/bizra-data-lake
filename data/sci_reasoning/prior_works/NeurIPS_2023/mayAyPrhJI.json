  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s central contribution\u2014recasting the Straight-Through (ST) estimator as a first-order method and introducing ReinMax as a second-order accurate surrogate via Heun\u2019s method\u2014builds directly on two strands of prior work. First, Bengio et al. (2013) originated and analyzed ST, and BinaryConnect (2015) demonstrated its practical value in binary networks, collectively establishing ST as the de facto tool for backpropagating through discrete operations despite its bias. This motivated a principled understanding of ST\u2019s approximation properties and the search for more accurate surrogates with minimal overhead. Second, a rich literature on gradients for discrete variables offers complementary approaches and baselines: REINFORCE (Williams, 1992) provides the foundational unbiased score-function estimator; NVIL (2014) introduced effective variance reduction via baselines; and REBAR (2017) and RELAX (2018) advanced unbiased estimators through reparameterization and optimized control variates. Parallel to these, Gumbel-Softmax (2017) enabled continuous relaxations for categorical variables, offering a different bias\u2013variance trade-off. The present work departs from both control-variate and continuous-relaxation paths by providing a numerical-analysis perspective: ST corresponds to a first-order approximation, so upgrading to a second-order method (Heun) yields higher accuracy without Hessians or significant compute. In doing so, it preserves the simplicity and efficiency that made ST successful while addressing its principal limitation\u2014bias\u2014thereby offering a practical, theoretically grounded alternative to prior estimators.",
