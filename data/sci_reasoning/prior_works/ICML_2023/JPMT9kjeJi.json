  "synthesis_narrative": "CounTS sits at the intersection of counterfactual explanation and sequential generative modeling. Pearl\u2019s causal framework provides the conceptual core: counterfactuals are computed via abduction, action, and prediction. Wachter et al. formalized counterfactual explanations as minimally perturbed inputs that achieve target outcomes; CounTS adopts this objective but elevates it to the time-series setting by enforcing temporal coherence and feasibility over trajectories. To make such counterfactual inference learnable end-to-end, CounTS builds on the variational causal machinery of CEVAE, extending the idea of counterfactuals through deep latent-variable models from static settings to sequences. This extension is enabled by variational state-space modeling\u2014specifically, the Structured Inference Networks/Deep Kalman Filters line\u2014which CounTS repurposes for posterior abduction from observed histories and forward generative rollout under interventions. On the actionability front, Ustun et al.\u2019s notion of cost-constrained, actionable recourse directly informs CounTS\u2019s design of temporal intervention constraints, while Karimi et al.\u2019s critique\u2014that recourse must align with causal interventions\u2014motivates embedding interventions within the learned generative model to ensure valid, feasible changes. Finally, DiCE serves both as a practical baseline and a source of evaluation criteria (proximity, sparsity, diversity), which CounTS adapts to sequential data; the model demonstrates superior, actionable counterfactual sequences without sacrificing predictive accuracy.",
