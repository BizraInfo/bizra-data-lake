  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper builds a principled, set-centric theory of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) by drawing on two complementary threads: the original IRL formulation and reward ambiguity, and modern sample-complexity theory for finite-horizon MDPs with generative models. Ng and Russell (2000) established the IRL problem and its inherent non-identifiability, while Ng, Harada, and Russell (1999) formalized reward-equivalence via potential-based shaping\u2014together motivating a focus on reward classes rather than unique solutions. Abbeel and Ng (2004) and Syed and Schapire (2007) pushed IRL toward a set-based view: the expert\u2019s optimality defines a set of reward functions (or linear weights) consistent with demonstrations, which can be used for robust policy construction. This paper elevates that perspective by defining the feasible reward set as the primary estimation target and giving a PAC framework for learning it. In contrast to Bayesian IRL (Ramachandran & Amir, 2007) and MaxEnt IRL (Ziebart et al., 2008), which resolve ambiguity by imposing priors or maximum-entropy principles to select a single solution, the authors aim to recover the entire set with frequentist guarantees. To ground this reframing theoretically, the work leverages and adapts lower-bound machinery from MDPs with generative models (Sidford et al., 2018), deriving the first minimax lower bounds for feasible reward set estimation with the characteristic H\u2013S\u2013A scaling. The result is a coherent lineage: classical IRL and reward-equivalence define the object, set-based apprenticeship learning suggests the target, and modern RL complexity theory provides the tools for tight minimax analysis.",
