  "synthesis_narrative": "DeepHalo\u2019s core innovation\u2014feature-based, controllable interaction orders with principled interpretability\u2014emerges at the intersection of behavioral choice theory and permutation-invariant neural set modeling. Classical discrete choice foundations (Luce, 1959) provide the benchmark MNL/IIA paradigm that assumes context-independent utilities; the very limitations of this view motivate modeling schemes that allow the composition of the choice set to influence preferences. Behavioral work on context dependence (Tversky, 1972; Tversky & Simonson, 1993) establishes both mechanisms and phenomena\u2014such as attraction and compromise effects\u2014that DeepHalo aims to capture, not merely reproduce, but decompose into identifiable first- and higher-order interactions.\nOn the modeling side, probabilistic set models like DPPs (Kulesza & Taskar, 2012) show how explicit pairwise interactions can encode context effects (e.g., similarity-driven repulsion), yet they remain structurally limited to order-2 effects. Neural set architectures (Deep Sets; Zaheer et al., 2017) deliver permutation invariance but largely aggregate independent item utilities, suppressing interactions; attention-based Set Transformers (Lee et al., 2019) introduce rich interactions but entangle them across orders, undermining interpretability. Theoretical advances in invariant/equivariant networks (Maron et al., 2019) demonstrate how k-ary constructions can control interaction order. DeepHalo synthesizes these threads: it retains permutation invariance, introduces explicit k-order feature-conditioned interaction terms, and yields interpretable decompositions aligned with behavioral phenomena. This resolves the trade-off between expressivity and interpretability that characterizes prior feature-based and neural approaches to context-dependent choice.",
