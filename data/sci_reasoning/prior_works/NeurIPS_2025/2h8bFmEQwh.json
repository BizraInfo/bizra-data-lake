  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014directly estimating the Fisher score for likelihood maximization in simulator-based models\u2014stands at the intersection of score estimation and likelihood-free optimization. Hyv\u00e4rinen\u2019s score matching provides the fundamental principle: learn gradients of log densities from samples without needing normalization, which the authors transpose from data space to parameter space to target \u2207\u03b8 log p(xobs|\u03b8). Vincent\u2019s denoising perspective justifies injecting local noise: simulating in a neighborhood around the current iterate effectively learns the score of a smoothed likelihood, explaining both the improved optimization landscape and the need to quantify smoothing bias.\n\nTo make this practical and fast, the work draws on scalable score estimation formulations such as sliced score matching, which yield quadratic objectives amenable to closed-form solutions under linear parameterizations\u2014directly enabling the paper\u2019s least-squares Fisher score surrogate. From the likelihood-free inference side, Wood\u2019s synthetic likelihood motivates smoothing the objective via simulations for robust MLE, while indirect inference contributes the idea of fitting an auxiliary (here, gradient) model to simulation output, naturally aligning with a linear, closed-form estimator. The sequential, localized simulation strategy echoes BOLFI\u2019s efficient allocation of simulator calls to informative regions. Finally, Robbins\u2013Monro provides the theoretical backbone for stable stochastic approximation with noisy gradient estimates, connecting the paper\u2019s bias\u2013variance analysis and convergence behavior. Together, these threads produce a principled, efficient pipeline for gradient-based maximization of intractable likelihoods via direct Fisher score estimation.",
