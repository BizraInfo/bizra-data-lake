  "synthesis_narrative": "CLIP-OGD\u2019s core contribution\u2014casting adaptive Neyman allocation as an online optimization problem and achieving O\u0303(\u221aT) Neyman regret\u2014sits at the intersection of classical experimental design and modern online learning. The target of the adaptive procedure is Neyman\u2019s 1934 optimal allocation, which minimizes the variance of the estimator by assigning proportionally to standard deviations. The design-based potential outcomes framework and variance formulas from Neyman (1923) supply the precise objective\u2014variance efficiency\u2014against which performance is judged, motivating the paper\u2019s Neyman Ratio and Neyman Regret metrics.\n\nAlgorithmically, the method borrows the Online Gradient Descent template and its O(\u221aT) regret guarantees from Zinkevich (2003), but must operate with partial information since counterfactual outcomes are unobserved. This motivates bandit-style gradient estimation as in Flaxman, Kalai, and McMahan (2005), and the comparison to the best fixed allocation mirrors the regret-to-best-fixed-action paradigm in Auer et al. (2002), where importance weighting under randomized assignment yields unbiased estimators.\n\nA practical obstacle is the high variance of importance-weighted gradients when propensities become small. CLIP-OGD addresses this by clipping the importance weights, an approach rooted in truncated/self-normalized importance sampling from Ionides (2008) and formalized for counterfactual learning by Swaminathan and Joachims (2015). This clipping yields stable gradients while introducing controlled bias, enabling tight concentration and, ultimately, the O\u0303(\u221aT) Neyman regret bound relative to the infeasible full-information Neyman allocation.",
