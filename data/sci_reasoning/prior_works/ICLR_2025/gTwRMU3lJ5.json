  "synthesis_narrative": "LoRA-Pro\u2019s core contribution\u2014showing that LoRA optimization is equivalent to full fine-tuning performed with a low-rank gradient and then exploiting this to adjust A/B gradients\u2014stands squarely on the LoRA formulation (Hu et al.), which defines the BA low-rank parameterization that LoRA-Pro analyzes and modifies. The broader premise that fine-tuning dynamics are largely confined to a low-dimensional subspace is grounded in Aghajanyan et al., motivating the viability of low-rank gradients as surrogates for full gradients. Multiple works exposed the performance gap between LoRA and full fine-tuning and sought to remedy it from different angles: AdaLoRA adapted rank budgets, ReLoRA increased effective rank via periodic merging, and DoRA reparameterized weights to better align update directions. PiSSA further emphasized the importance of subspace alignment by initializing LoRA along principal directions. Among these, LoRA+ most directly foreshadowed LoRA-Pro\u2019s optimization-centric remedy by showing that asymmetrically scaling A and B\u2019s learning rates (i.e., their gradients) yields consistent gains. LoRA-Pro unifies and advances these insights with a precise equivalence: the effective LoRA step is a constrained, low-rank gradient step, whose quality depends on how A/B gradients compose into that low-rank gradient. By deriving optimal A/B gradient adjustments to better approximate the full fine-tuning gradient, LoRA-Pro addresses the root optimization gap identified across prior work, narrowing LoRA\u2019s performance deficit without changing model rank or architecture.",
