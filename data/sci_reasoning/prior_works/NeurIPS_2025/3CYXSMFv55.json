  "synthesis_narrative": "ENMA\u2019s core contribution\u2014a tokenwise generative neural operator for spatio-temporal PDE dynamics trained with flow matching\u2014stands at the intersection of operator learning, set-conditioned function modeling, and modern latent generative techniques. Foundational operator-learning works such as DeepONet and the Fourier Neural Operator established that neural networks can learn mappings between function spaces to solve whole families of parametric PDEs. ENMA adopts this operator perspective but reframes prediction as generative forecasting in time, producing future fields as sequences of latent tokens.\n\nTo condition on irregularly sampled observations and auxiliary trajectories, ENMA leverages attention-based context aggregation introduced by Attentive Neural Processes, enabling permutation-invariant set-to-latent encoding and in-context generalization. Efficiency and scalability are achieved by predicting in a compressed representation, a design choice strongly informed by Latent Diffusion Models, which showed the benefits of modeling high-dimensional signals in learned latent spaces.\n\nFor the generative mechanism, ENMA draws on masked tokenwise generation strategies exemplified by MaskGIT, adapting masked autoregressive transformers to spatio-temporal tokens rather than discrete image codebooks. Crucially, training relies on flow-based objectives: Flow Matching supplies a stable, path-consistent way to learn deterministic transport fields, while Conditional Flow Matching enables conditioning on past states or auxiliary trajectories. Together, these strands yield ENMA\u2019s innovation: a flow-matched, masked-autoregressive neural operator that performs in-context, tokenwise generation of continuous PDE dynamics in a compact latent space.",
