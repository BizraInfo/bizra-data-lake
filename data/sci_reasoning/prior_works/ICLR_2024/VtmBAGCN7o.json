  "synthesis_narrative": "Role-playing as a mechanism for organizing LLM collaboration first emerged in CAMEL, where explicitly assigned roles and structured dialogues enabled two agents to pursue a shared goal more reliably through scripted exchanges. AutoGen then provided a general interaction substrate for multi-agent systems by formalizing conversation-driven orchestration, message passing, and human-in-the-loop options. In applied software engineering, ChatDev operationalized a company-style pipeline of specialized roles (e.g., product, design, coding, review), showing that multi-agent specialization can generate end-to-end software but also exposing brittle handoffs. In parallel, HuggingGPT demonstrated that an LLM can plan, decompose, and delegate complex tasks to specialized components, validating a controller-and-experts pattern akin to an assembly line. At the reasoning level, ReAct showed that interleaving thought with actions and observations improves reliability by grounding intermediate steps. Broad multi-agent studies like AgentVerse documented emergent cooperation alongside frequent coordination failures, underscoring the need for stronger procedural constraints.\nTogether, these works exposed an opportunity: while role specialization and conversation scaffolding enable multi-agent LLM workflows, they lack standardized, verifiable procedures for artifact handoffs, allowing errors to cascade. The natural next step is to codify human Standard Operating Procedures as executable prompt sequences that constrain each role\u2019s responsibilities, enforce checkpoints, and structure inter-agent verification\u2014realizing an assembly-line paradigm on top of conversation frameworks. This synthesis yields coherent, end-to-end collaborations that reduce cascading hallucinations and produce higher-quality software artifacts.",

    "abstract": "Recently, remarkable progress has been made on automated problem solving through societies of agents based on large language models (LLMs). Previous LLM-based multi-agent systems can already solve simple dialogue tasks. More complex tasks, however, face challenges through logic inconsistencies due to cascading hallucinations caused by naively chaining LLMs. Here we introduce MetaGPT, an innovative meta-programming framework incorporating efficient human workflows into LLM-based multi-agent collaborations. MetaGPT encodes Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) into prompt sequences for more streamlined workflows, thus allowing agents with human-like domain expertise to verify intermediate results and reduce errors.  MetaGPT utilizes an assembly line paradigm to assign diverse roles to various agents, efficiently breaking down complex tasks into subtasks involving many agents working together.  On collaborative software engineering benchmarks, MetaGPT generates more coherent solutions ",
