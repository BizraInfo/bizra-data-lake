  "synthesis_narrative": "X-Field\u2019s key contribution\u2014a physics-informed 3D representation for X-ray NVS and CT\u2014emerges from unifying classical CT physics with modern neural scene representations and efficient ray traversal. From the physics side, Toft\u2019s formulation of the Radon transform and Beer\u2013Lambert attenuation provides the mathematical backbone for treating X-ray measurements as line integrals of attenuation, while the Shepp\u2013Logan phantom demonstrates that anatomy can be fruitfully modeled as a sum of homogeneous ellipsoids with distinct attenuation coefficients. These two strands directly motivate X-Field\u2019s choice of ellipsoidal, piecewise-constant primitives and its attenuation-centric rendering equation.\n\nOn the algorithmic side, Siddon\u2019s exact path-length computation through voxels and the Amanatides\u2013Woo event-ordered traversal inform X-Field\u2019s efficient path-partitioning: the ray is decomposed into entry/exit segments across many overlapping primitives, enabling accurate, scalable accumulation of attenuation. This generalizes classical grid-based traversal to a quadric (ellipsoidal) setting.\n\nFrom the neural rendering side, NeRF contributes the end-to-end differentiable, ray-based optimization framework, which X-Field adapts by replacing radiance emission with physically grounded transmittance. 3D Gaussian Splatting inspires the use of many anisotropic, ellipsoidal primitives and practical large-scale optimization; X-Field departs by enforcing homogeneous interiors and resolving exact intersections rather than relying on smooth density accumulation. Finally, DeepDRR\u2019s differentiable X-ray rendering validates the integration of physics-based forward models into learning pipelines, guiding X-Field\u2019s training for both novel-view X-ray synthesis and CT reconstruction with reduced dose.",
