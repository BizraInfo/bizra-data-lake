  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper reframes the attention sink phenomenon as the manifestation of learned reference frames that anchor high-dimensional representational spaces. Early transformer designs such as BERT established a centralized anchor via the [CLS] token, creating a natural attractor in attention maps. Empirical studies in vision transformers reinforced this picture, showing class-token\u2013centric heads and head specialization patterns that mirror centralized anchoring. Architectures that explicitly introduce latent anchors\u2014Set Transformers with inducing points and Perceiver with a latent array\u2014demonstrate that centralized or distributed anchors can be built into the model, making sink-like patterns a predictable consequence of the reference structure.\n\nThe geometric role of positional information is pivotal: RoPE encodes positions as rotations in a shared feature space, while ALiBi imposes linear distance biases. Both instantiate coordinate systems with distinct inductive biases, directly shaping whether models favor centralized, distributed, or bidirectional reference frames\u2014and thus the specific form of attention sink that appears. Finally, mechanistic interpretability work on induction heads shows that structured attention circuits arise very early in training, supporting the paper\u2019s claim that reference frames emerge as near-optimal solutions for stabilizing token relationships in high-dimensional spaces.\n\nTogether, these strands\u2014anchor tokens and latent arrays, geometric positional schemes, and early-emerging attention circuits\u2014provide the intellectual scaffolding the paper synthesizes into a unifying geometric account of attention sink and its architectural determinants.",
