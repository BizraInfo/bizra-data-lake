  "synthesis_narrative": "Clark et al. showed that individual attention heads in BERT consistently align with specific dependency relations, establishing that syntactic attention patterns naturally arise in Transformers. Voita et al. went further by identifying that a small set of specialized heads carries much of the syntactic load and that ablating these heads harms performance, demonstrating a causal role for syntactic heads and providing a concrete intervention paradigm. Olsson et al. uncovered that particular attention circuits\u2014induction heads\u2014can appear suddenly during training at the moment of a sharp loss drop, revealing a phase-transition dynamic that links internal structure formation to optimization jumps. Saphra and Lopez introduced tools and a framing for following how linguistic properties develop over the course of training, emphasizing trajectories rather than endpoints. Shwartz-Ziv and Tishby argued that deep networks undergo phase-like transitions during optimization, suggesting discrete reorganizations of internal representations. Valle-Perez et al. articulated that neural networks are biased toward simple functions, offering a mechanism by which certain structured solutions can be preferentially discovered. Together, these works expose that syntactic structure can be embodied in attention heads, that such heads are causally important, that internal circuits can emerge abruptly with loss drops, and that training-time analysis and simplicity bias are critical to understanding these phenomena. Building on this, the current paper traces the emergence of syntactic attention structure throughout MLM pretraining, identifies a sudden, loss-aligned phase where these heads crystallize, and uses targeted interventions to show that this structure is necessary for subsequent grammatical capabilities, framing the effect through the lens of simplicity bias.",

    "abstract": "Most interpretability research in NLP focuses on understanding the behavior and features of a fully trained model. However, certain insights into model behavior may only be accessible by observing the trajectory of the training process. We present a case study of syntax acquisition in masked language models (MLMs) that demonstrates how analyzing the evolution of interpretable artifacts throughout training deepens our understanding of emergent behavior. In particular, we study Syntactic Attention Structure (SAS), a naturally emerging property of MLMs wherein specific Transformer heads tend to focus on specific syntactic relations. We identify a brief window in pretraining when models abruptly acquire SAS, concurrent with a steep drop in loss. This breakthrough precipitates the subsequent acquisition of linguistic capabilities. We then examine the causal role of SAS by manipulating SAS during training, and demonstrate that SAS is necessary for the development of grammatical capabilities.",
