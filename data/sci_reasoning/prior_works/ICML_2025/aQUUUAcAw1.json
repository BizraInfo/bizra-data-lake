  "synthesis_narrative": "Sparse-pivot\u2019s core innovation\u2014bringing a constant-factor, polylog-update correlation clustering algorithm to the database-query dynamic insertion model\u2014rests on two pillars: the dynamic model itself and pivot-based correlation clustering. The model and baseline were set by Cohen-Addad et al. (ICML 2024), who defined how an algorithm can access the evolving signed graph via database queries and update the clustering as nodes arrive; Sparse-pivot is expressly built to operate in this model and to remedy its main shortcoming: a large approximation factor. On the algorithmic side, Sparse-pivot decisively inherits and retools the pivoting paradigm from Ailon\u2013Charikar\u2013Newman, turning KwikCluster into a query-sparse, dynamically maintainable procedure. Its analysis borrows the local charging/triangle-inequality style of van Zuylen\u2013Williamson\u2019s deterministic pivoting framework to show that one can preserve constant-factor guarantees even when only a sparse subset of edges is queried per insertion. Foundationally, the work of Bansal\u2013Blum\u2013Chawla and Charikar\u2013Guruswami\u2013Wirth defined the min-disagreement objective and provided approximation and LP perspectives that anchor the target guarantee and guide the decomposition of disagreement costs in analysis. Finally, the online-correlation-clustering line (e.g., Ailon et al. 2014) underscored the limitations of irrevocable, arrival-based decisions, motivating dynamic models with reclustering; Sparse-pivot advances this direction by showing that a carefully designed sparse-pivot mechanism yields both strong theory (20+\u03b5) and practical improvements within the dynamic database-access setting.",
