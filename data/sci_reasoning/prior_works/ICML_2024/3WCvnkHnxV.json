  "synthesis_narrative": "PrE-Text\u2019s key contribution\u2014replacing on-device federated training with a differentially private synthetic text pipeline\u2014stands at the intersection of three strands of prior work. First, the federated learning literature (McMahan et al., 2017) and its DP extensions (Geyer et al., 2017) articulated the challenges of on-device optimization: limited device capacity, heavy communication, and complex deployment. These works defined the user-level privacy goal that PrE-Text seeks to satisfy while circumventing the operational burdens of FedAvg. Second, differential privacy methodology\u2014particularly R\u00e9nyi Differential Privacy (Mironov, 2017)\u2014provides the accounting backbone enabling tight privacy composition for iterative noisy mechanisms, allowing PrE-Text to offer concrete user-level epsilon guarantees in practical regimes. Third, recent advances in LLM-driven data synthesis showed that high-utility synthetic corpora can be created and used to train smaller models: Self-Instruct (Wang et al., 2022) and Evol-Instruct/WizardLM (Xu et al., 2023) established scalable, iterative instruction/data generation, while TinyStories (Eldan & Li, 2023) provided compelling evidence that small LMs can learn effectively from synthetic text alone. Bridging these, PATE (Papernot et al., 2017) offered a principled template for differentially private knowledge transfer into public/synthetic data. PrE-Text operationalizes this template in the language domain by combining evolution-style LLM synthesis with rigorous DP accounting, yielding a DP synthetic corpus that trains small models more efficiently and, when used to fine-tune larger models, delivers utility without exposing raw user data.",
