  "synthesis_narrative": "RHEL\u2019s central innovation\u2014computing exact loss gradients from finite differences of physical trajectories by exploiting time-reversal symmetry in Hamiltonian systems\u2014sits at the intersection of adjoint-based optimization, energy-based learning, and structure-preserving simulation. The adjoint-state lineage (Pontryagin\u2019s maximum principle) provides the mathematical backbone: RHEL proves that its echo protocol is formally equivalent to the continuous adjoint method, but executes this sensitivity analysis via forward physics rather than explicit Jacobian or backward adjoint integration. Neural ODEs translated adjoint sensitivities into mainstream ML practice and highlighted the benefits of reverse-time integration for memory efficiency; RHEL retains the adjoint exactness while replacing reverse integration with three forward physical passes that are amenable to non-digital hardware.\n\nMethodologically, RHEL inherits from equilibrium propagation the idea that exact gradients can emerge from differences between nearby physical steady states or trajectories, generalizing this two-phase concept to non-dissipative Hamiltonian flows with a variance-free, three-pass protocol. Its reliance on Hamiltonian, energy-conserving dynamics is grounded in the HNN program and made practical by geometric numerical integration: symplectic, time-reversible discretizations ensure that the echo faithfully transports the loss signal without numerical dissipation. The use of reversibility to eliminate activation storage resonates with reversible residual networks, reinforcing the compute/memory advantages of invertible dynamics. Finally, the very mechanism of an \u2018echo\u2019\u2014injecting a precise perturbation and refocusing it by time reversal\u2014harkens back to Hahn\u2019s spin echo, here repurposed to encode and recover gradients, enabling scalable training of deep state-space models and long-range temporal dependencies with only three forward simulations.",
