  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core idea\u2014using interaction paths as the primary unit for contrastive learning and designing both intra-path and inter-path objectives\u2014emerges from two converging threads. First, LightGCN established an effective CF backbone over user\u2013item bipartite graphs, while SGL adapted graph contrastive learning to recommendation via stochastic graph augmentations and node-level alignment. However, these augmentations can inadvertently separate semantically related nodes that lie along meaningful interaction paths, exposing a false-negative problem. NCL took a step toward fixing this by treating structural neighbors as positives, suggesting that positives should reflect local graph semantics rather than arbitrary augmented views.\nSecond, advances in graph/self-supervised learning highlighted the utility of path- or subgraph-level semantics. HeCo formalized meta-path semantic views in heterogeneous graphs and contrasted across such views, motivating the leap from node-level to path-level signals and the introduction of inter-path contrast. GCC showed that random-walk substructures can serve as anchor units for contrast, while node2vec and PinSage provided scalable, biased random-walk sampling mechanisms to extract informative paths in large recommender graphs.\nSynthesizing these insights, the paper reframes positives from individual nodes under random augmentations to sampled interaction paths, and it decouples supervision into intra-path alignment (target-to-path nodes) and inter-path alignment (path-to-path semantics). This directly addresses sparsity and false negatives by leveraging multi-hop relational signals that augment LightGCN-style CF embeddings with path-aware self-supervision.",
