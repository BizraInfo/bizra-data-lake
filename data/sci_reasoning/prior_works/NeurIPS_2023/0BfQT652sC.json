  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014characterizing the precise interplay between worst-case optimality, instance-dependent consistency, and light-tailed risk, and proposing a policy that achieves any target (\u03b1, \u03b2) while attaining optimal regret-tail decay\u2014rests on three pillars from prior work. First, Lai and Robbins established the instance-dependent lower bounds and consistency paradigm that define what it means to be distribution-dependent optimal. Second, the UCB lineage (Auer et al.; Auer and Ortner) provided finite-time and high-probability analyses linking expected regret to deviation probabilities, setting methodological templates for controlling regret tails. Third, KL-based and carefully tuned confidence policies (Garivier and Capp\u00e9\u2019s KL-UCB; Lattimore\u2019s OCUCB) demonstrated how sharper, information-theoretic confidence radii yield exponential-type deviations and can simultaneously balance worst-case and instance-dependent performance.\n\nAudibert and Bubeck\u2019s MOSS clarified the minimax frontier and exposed tension with instance-dependent optimality, directly motivating a calibrated trade-off rather than a single operating point. Building on these insights, the paper formalizes how the order of expected regret dictates achievable tail decay and designs a policy whose confidence structure interpolates between minimax and instance-dependent regimes while preserving exponential tail behavior with only polynomial prefactors\u2014proving this rate is unimprovable. Finally, the non-stationary extension leverages the Besbes\u2013Gur\u2013Zeevi framework to transplant these guarantees beyond the stationary setting, showing that the proposed tail-optimal trade-offs persist under controlled reward drift.",
