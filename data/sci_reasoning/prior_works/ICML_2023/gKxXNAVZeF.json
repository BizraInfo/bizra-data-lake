  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s main contribution\u2014nonparametric, nonasymptotic inference for means under local differential privacy via a generalized randomized response mechanism\u2014rests on two intertwined lineages: local privacy mechanisms and time-uniform inference. On the privacy side, Warner\u2019s seminal randomized response introduced the core idea of privatizing individual reports, which later matured into the formal local DP framework and mean-estimation theory in Duchi et al. (2013). Subsequent advances, notably Kairouz et al. (2016) and Bassily et al. (2015), characterized and deployed generalized randomized response mechanisms for discrete alphabets, delineating the extremal design space that this work extends to arbitrary bounded real variables and to sequentially interactive settings. Duchi et al. (2018) established minimax-optimal estimation procedures under LDP but left open the challenge of exact, nonasymptotic uncertainty quantification; this paper directly addresses that gap by delivering private confidence intervals and confidence sequences.\nOn the inference side, the authors leverage the modern supermartingale framework for time-uniform bounds developed by Howard et al. (2021), adapting it to privatized data to obtain private analogues of Hoeffding-type guarantees. Hoeffding\u2019s (1963) inequality serves as the non-private baseline, with the current work producing its fixed-time and time-uniform counterparts under LDP. Together, these strands yield a unified approach: a generalized, interactive randomized response tailored for bounded variables and the supermartingale-based machinery to produce rigorous, private CIs and CSs, including for time-varying means.",
