  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014F-distance regularized policy optimization constrained to globally accessible states across dynamics\u2014emerges from three converging lines of work. First, imitation as distribution matching (GAIL) and its observation-only variants (BCO, GAIfO) established that expert behavior can be recovered from state trajectories by aligning occupancy/state distributions, but also revealed that pure imitation inherits an expert-performance ceiling and is brittle when the learner\u2019s dynamics differ from the expert\u2019s. Second, distribution-matching methods grounded in stationary occupancies and f-divergences (ValueDICE) provided practical estimators and objectives for aligning state marginals, while safe policy improvement under support constraints (SPIBB) emphasized that reliable learning requires restricting updates to regions supported by data. These ideas directly motivate the paper\u2019s notion of globally accessible states\u2014the intersection of supports across dynamics\u2014to avoid wasting modeling capacity on unreachable regions after dynamics shift. Third, divergence-constrained policy optimization (MPO) and demonstrations-regularized RL (AWAC) offered algorithmic blueprints for coupling reward maximization with a principled regularizer. The presented framework fuses these strands: it optimizes return while enforcing an F-distance constraint only over states that are visitable under all considered dynamics, thereby sidestepping unreachable expert states and breaking the strict imitation upper bound. This synthesis yields both theoretical guarantees under different F-distance instantiations and a practical accessible-state-oriented algorithm.",
