  "synthesis_narrative": "LogicTree\u2019s core contribution\u2014a scalable framework that builds multi-step logic trees via backward deduction and then instantiates them into realistic scenarios\u2014emerges at the intersection of three research threads. First, template- and ontology-based synthetic reasoning datasets like CLUTRR and PrOntoQA established controllable generation of multi-step logical tasks, but their rigidity and limited domain variability constrain real-world applicability. LogicTree directly addresses this by abandoning fixed templates and ontologies in favor of iterative rule search with structural pattern matching, allowing richer, more adaptable compositions.\nSecond, works that operationalize proof structures\u2014RuleTaker, ProofWriter, and EntailmentBank\u2014demonstrated that multi-step logical reasoning can be trained and evaluated effectively when derivations are explicit. LogicTree inherits this proof-centric perspective but automates construction of deeper, branching logic trees through backward deduction, producing complex reasoning patterns beyond hand-crafted or static rulebases.\nThird, LLM-driven data generation pipelines such as Self-Instruct showed how models can synthesize and filter large-scale supervision. LogicTree leverages this paradigm for a two-stage instantiation: after symbolic tree construction, LLMs map abstract predicates and rules into diverse, grounded natural-language scenarios with quality control. Finally, the methodological choice of backward deduction and rule unification is grounded in Neural Theorem Provers, which formalized backward-chaining with structural matching. Together, these antecedents crystallize in LogicTree\u2019s hybrid symbolic\u2013LLM pipeline that yields complex, instantiated logical data at scale.",
