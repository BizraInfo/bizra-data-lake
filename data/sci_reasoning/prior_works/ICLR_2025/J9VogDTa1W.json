  "synthesis_narrative": "Invariant Causal Prediction established that causal relations can be identified by mechanisms that remain stable across environments, crystallizing a powerful but brittle assumption when mechanisms change. Building on the utility of distribution shift, work on nonstationary and heterogeneous data introduced the idea of exploiting environment or time as a surrogate variable to detect and orient edges precisely because mechanisms vary. Mixture LiNGAM further demonstrated that observational heterogeneity can reflect a latent mixture of distinct SCMs, revealing that different DAGs can govern different latent classes within the same dataset. Joint Causal Inference unified multi-environment data through explicit context variables, enabling principled pooling and separation of datasets arising from interventions or other contextual changes. Abstraction frameworks for SCMs provided conditions under which distinct low-level models collapse to the same high-level causal behavior, suggesting an equivalence-based grouping over parameterized mechanisms. Complementarily, meta-learning objectives for disentangling causal mechanisms showed how modularity and reuse can be detected from adaptation patterns, especially in agent-driven settings. Finally, the bridge from dynamical systems to SCMs proved that qualitative regime transitions (e.g., bifurcations) correspond to different causal models. Together, these works exposed both the promise and limits of invariance, highlighted mixtures and context as drivers of causal heterogeneity, and supplied formal tools for equivalence and modularity. The current work synthesizes these insights by defining meta-causal states\u2014equivalence classes over SCMs with qualitatively identical behavior\u2014inferring them from agent behavior or unlabeled data, and showing that dynamical regimes naturally instantiate such states, thus generalizing invariance-based causal reasoning to systems with switching causal relations.",

    "abstract": "Most work on causality in machine learning assumes that causal relationships are driven by a constant underlying process. However, the flexibility of agents' actions or tipping points in the environmental process can change the qualitative dynamics of the system. As a result, new causal relationships may emerge, while existing ones change or disappear, resulting in an altered causal graph. To analyze these qualitative changes on the causal graph, we propose the concept of meta-causal states, which groups classical causal models into clusters based on equivalent qualitative behavior and consolidates specific mechanism parameterizations. We demonstrate how meta-causal states can be inferred from observed agent behavior, and discuss potential methods for disentangling these states from unlabeled data. Finally, we direct our analysis towards the application of a dynamical system, showing that meta-causal states can also emerge from inherent system dynamics, and thus constitute more than a ",
