  "synthesis_narrative": "Stable Part Diffusion 4D (SP4D) fuses advances in latent diffusion, video generation, and structure-aware conditioning to jointly synthesize RGB and kinematic part videos from a single view. At its core, SP4D inherits the latent autoencoding backbone of Latent Diffusion Models, enabling efficient high-resolution generation. This architectural choice makes it natural to encode segmentation masks as continuous, RGB-like images so that both appearance and parts share the same VAE and latent space, simplifying multi-head design and allowing variable part counts.\n\nTo ensure temporal coherence, SP4D leverages principles from video diffusion (e.g., Imagen Video) that stabilize motion and content across frames. For multi-view consistency, it borrows the key idea from DreamFusion: use a strong 2D diffusion prior to regularize cross-view agreement\u2014here extended to simultaneously maintain consistency between views and across modalities (RGB and parts) through a Bidirectional Diffusion Fusion pathway.\n\nOn the structure side, SP4D\u2019s kinematic parts philosophy connects to unsupervised landmark learning (Thewlis et al.), treating parts as deformation-stable structural tokens aligned with articulation rather than purely semantic appearance. PartNet-Mobility informs the notion of articulated components and provides a kinematics-aware taxonomy useful for supervision or evaluation. Finally, SP4D\u2019s contrastive part-consistency objective traces to SimCLR\u2019s InfoNCE formulation, adapted at the dense/part level to tighten spatial-temporal alignment between modalities and viewpoints. Together, these strands yield a dual-branch, cross-consistent 4D generator that produces synchronized RGB and kinematic part sequences.",
