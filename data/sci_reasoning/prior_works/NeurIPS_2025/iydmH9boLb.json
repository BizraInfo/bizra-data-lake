  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation\u2014encouraging real expert specialization in MoE LLMs by coupling an orthogonality loss with a variance-inducing routing loss\u2014arises directly from the modern MoE lineage that standardized auxiliary load balancing. Shazeer et al. (2017) established the MoE framework and the auxiliary importance/load terms that prevent collapse but also implicitly push toward uniformity. This practice was scaled and entrenched by GShard (Lepikhin et al., 2020) and Switch Transformers (Fedus et al., 2021), which rely on the same balancing family for top-2 and top-1 routing, respectively; these models are the immediate baselines where uniform routing and expert overlap degrade specialization, especially during post-training. GLaM (Du et al., 2022) further cemented this recipe at LLM scale, adding router regularization for stability but still depending on balancing that can blunt discriminative routing. Concurrently, V-MoE (Riquelme et al., 2021) documented specialization patterns and highlighted co-activation/uniformity behaviors under balancing, sharpening the precise gap our work targets. Our solution directly complements this established auxiliary loss: the orthogonality term reduces expert overlap by encouraging distinct token assignments, while the variance term makes routing more discriminative, countering uniform gates without sacrificing utilization. Finally, the ideas extend naturally to other sparse frameworks such as BASE Layers (Lewis et al., 2021), reinforcing that the contribution is a principled, general-purpose refinement to MoE routing objectives rather than an architecture-specific tweak.",
