  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014an end-to-end framework in which cortical circuits infer the brain\u2019s internal color dimensionality directly from optic nerve signals\u2014rests on three intertwined intellectual strands. First, efficient coding theories of color (Buchsbaum & Gottschalk; Atick, Li & Redlich) established that decorrelating cone inputs under natural-image statistics yields opponent channels, implying that dimensional structure can, in principle, be recovered from sensory fluctuations without supervision. Complementing this, Ruderman, Cronin & Chiao quantified the actual statistics of L, M, and S cone responses to natural scenes, providing the empirical substrate necessary for a realistic simulation of the optic nerve signals that drive learning. Second, physiological characterizations of chromatic pathways (Derrington, Krauskopf & Lennie) identified L\u2013M and S\u2013(L+M) mechanisms, offering concrete targets against which emergent internal representations can be validated. Third, bio-plausible unsupervised learning rules (Oja) and independent component analyses (Hyv\u00e4rinen & Oja) demonstrated how neural circuits can discover low-dimensional, opponent-like bases from input statistics, directly informing the cortical learning component that infers dimensionality. Finally, computational observer frameworks for early vision (Cottaris et al.) showed how to synthesize optics, cone mosaics, and retinal encoding from natural images, which this work leverages and extends to generate the optic nerve fluctuations needed for learning. Together, these works directly enable and shape the paper\u2019s central innovation: joint simulation of eye and cortex to explain the emergence and identification of the brain\u2019s color dimensionality.",
