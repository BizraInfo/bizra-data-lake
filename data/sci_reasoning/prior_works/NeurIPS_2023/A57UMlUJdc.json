  "synthesis_narrative": "MEX\u2019s core idea\u2014optimizing a single unconstrained objective that simultaneously performs estimation, planning, and exploration\u2014sits at the intersection of two historically separate strands: optimism-driven exploration and general function approximation. Foundational OFU methods such as UCRL2 and UCBVI established that adding confidence bonuses to planning yields strong regret guarantees in tabular settings. LSVI-UCB then showed how to lift this optimism principle into function approximation by coupling least-squares estimation with UCB-style bonuses. In parallel, OLIVE provided a landmark framework for rich function classes but relied on data-dependent level-set constraints and elimination procedures that are theoretically elegant yet impractical. MEX synthesizes these insights by encoding optimism directly into a single maximization objective, thereby avoiding both OLIVE\u2019s constraint machinery and the need to alternate between separate estimation and planning phases. Relative to randomized exploration approaches like Bootstrapped DQN, MEX attains directed exploration without posterior or ensemble sampling, simplifying implementation while preserving principled uncertainty handling. Finally, the methodology\u2019s optimistic backbone naturally extends to competitive multi-agent settings; prior work on zero-sum Markov games with function approximation informs MEX\u2019s game-theoretic extension and its regret guarantees. Collectively, these predecessors motivate MEX\u2019s design and analysis: retain the statistical power of optimism, respect the realities of general function approximation, and collapse exploration, estimation, and planning into a single tractable objective.",
