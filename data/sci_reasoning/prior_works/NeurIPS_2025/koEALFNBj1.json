  "synthesis_narrative": "REG\u2019s core insight\u2014entangling low-level diffusion latents with a single high-level token from a pretrained foundation encoder\u2014stands at the intersection of advances in diffusion architectures, latent-space modeling, and discriminative\u2013generative coupling. DiT provided a transformer-based denoiser and clean interfaces for token-based conditioning, making it natural to inject and propagate an external token throughout denoising. LDM contributed the efficiency and inductive bias of operating in a compressed latent space, which REG exploits by binding a compact semantic token to these low-level latents. ViT and CLIP supply precisely the kind of global, robust representation REG needs: a class/global token encapsulating high-level semantics learned at massive scale. unCLIP demonstrated that a single CLIP embedding can deterministically decode to images with diffusion, directly foreshadowing REG\u2019s use of one high-level token\u2014yet REG integrates that token directly into the denoiser rather than relying on a separate prior/decoder stack. Concurrently, Guided Diffusion and Classifier-Free Guidance established that discriminative signals\u2014whether from external classifiers or learned conditioning\u2014can markedly boost fidelity and control. REG synthesizes these strands by internalizing a pretrained discriminative token into the diffusion transformer\u2019s feature flow. Unlike prior alignment-style approaches that supervise against external features only during training (and then vanish at inference), the entangled token remains present and active throughout denoising, yielding coherent image\u2013class pairs from pure noise while improving training stability and efficiency with negligible inference overhead.",
