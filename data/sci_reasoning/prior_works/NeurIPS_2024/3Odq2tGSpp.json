  "synthesis_narrative": "Stylus\u2019s core innovation\u2014automatically selecting and composing multiple diffusion adapters from a large, unstructured repository\u2014rests on three converging lines of prior work. First, the notion of small, pluggable task modules originates with Houlsby-style adapters, and LoRA makes such modules lightweight and ubiquitous in diffusion, creating a practical substrate (and a massive ecosystem) for Stylus to operate on. Second, research on composing adapters, epitomized by AdapterFusion, directly motivates Stylus\u2019s premise that multiple specialized adapters can be combined to outperform single-task finetuning. AdapterHub further demonstrates that community-scale adapter repositories require metadata, search, and reuse workflows\u2014precisely the operational challenges Stylus addresses via summarization and retrieval.\nThird, Stylus\u2019s retrieval and matching stage is enabled by CLIP-like text\u2013image embeddings and improved descriptions, allowing it to map prompt keywords to semantically relevant adapters even when original metadata is sparse or noisy. Finally, work on multi-concept customization in diffusion, such as Custom Diffusion, and the broader principle of composing conditional signals via classifier-free guidance, establish that combining multiple controls in diffusion is both feasible and beneficial. Stylus synthesizes these threads into an end-to-end system: summarize adapters to create robust embeddings, retrieve a candidate set aligned with the prompt, and automatically assemble a stylus of adapters that best fits the user\u2019s intent\u2014turning community-scale adapter chaos into targeted, high-quality image generation.",
