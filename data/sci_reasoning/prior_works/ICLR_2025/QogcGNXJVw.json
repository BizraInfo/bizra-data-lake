  "synthesis_narrative": "The circuits line of work established that model behavior can be explained by sparse subnetworks of neurons and connections, with Zoom In detailing how such circuits mediate specific tasks through interconnected components rather than isolated units. Building on this, a mathematical framework for transformer circuits made precise the notions of paths, mediating components, and patch-based interventions, operationalizing how to trace and validate causal pathways in deep models. Heuristic efforts toward automated circuit discovery proposed practical search procedures using activation and path patching across nodes and edges to assemble candidate circuits, while explicitly flagging issues of scalability and faithfulness. Intervention-centric theory further clarified how to evaluate mechanisms by distinguishing predictive adequacy from control via causal interventions and fidelity criteria, grounding explanation in causal semantics. Empirically, locating and editing factual associations showed how small mediating subnetworks can be identified and surgically edited to control outputs, and toy models of superposition demonstrated that features distribute across units, hinting at inherently combinatorial search spaces.\nTaken together, these works defined the objects (circuits as mediating subnetworks), the empirical procedures (patching and causal tracing), and the evaluative semantics (prediction vs. control) while surfacing practical failures (scalability, unfaithfulness, superposition). The natural next step was to abstract these concrete circuit-finding and intervention tasks into formal query families aligned with explanatory affordances and to determine their inherent difficulty. By doing so, the current paper synthesizes the circuit and causal-intervention insights into a unified complexity-theoretic framework that classifies which circuit-discovery goals are tractable and which are provably hard, including parameterized regimes keyed to sparsity, depth, and layer structure.",

    "abstract": "Many proposed applications of neural networks in machine learning, cognitive/brain science, and society hinge on the feasibility of inner interpretability via circuit discovery. This calls for empirical and theoretical explorations of viable algorithmic options. Despite advances in the design and testing of heuristics, there are concerns about their scalability and faithfulness at a time when we lack understanding of the complexity properties of the problems they are deployed to solve. To address this, we study circuit discovery with classical and parameterized computational complexity theory: (1) we describe a conceptual scaffolding to reason about circuit finding queries in terms of affordances for description, explanation, prediction and control; (2) we formalize a comprehensive set of queries for mechanistic explanation, and propose a formal framework for their analysis; (3) we use it to settle the complexity of many query variants and relaxations of practical interest on multi-lay",
