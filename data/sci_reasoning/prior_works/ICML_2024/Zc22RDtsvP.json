  "synthesis_narrative": "MagicLens sits at the intersection of two lines of work: text-conditioned image retrieval and instruction-tuned vision-language learning. The composed image retrieval paradigm was crystallized by Vo et al.\u2019s TIRG, which formalized retrieving a target image given a reference image and a natural-language modification. Earlier, WhittleSearch introduced the core notion of guiding retrieval with human-understandable linguistic feedback, but it relied on small, predefined attribute vocabularies\u2014precisely the restriction MagicLens seeks to overcome with open-ended instructions. In parallel, CLIP established that web-scale weak supervision and contrastive learning can yield powerful retrieval models; MagicLens adopts this web-first ethos but pivots from image\u2013alt-text pairs to naturally co-occurring image\u2013image pairs on the same webpages, whose implicit relations it makes explicit via synthesized instructions. The mechanism for creating such supervision draws directly from instruction-generation advances in language and vision-language models. Self-Instruct showed that LLMs can bootstrap instruction-following ability through synthetic instructions, while LLaVA and InstructBLIP demonstrated that GPT-assisted visual instruction tuning can train VLMs to follow open-ended image-grounded instructions. InstructPix2Pix further validated the utility of paired images linked by synthetic instructions, providing a close analogue for MagicLens\u2019s image-pair supervision. Together, these works directly motivate MagicLens\u2019s key insight: scale composed retrieval beyond curated, narrowly defined relations by harvesting web co-occurring image pairs and using foundation models to synthesize rich, open-ended instructions that explicitly express their underlying relationships.",
