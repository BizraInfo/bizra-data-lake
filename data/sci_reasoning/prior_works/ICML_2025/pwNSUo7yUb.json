  "synthesis_narrative": "Inductive Moment Matching (MMSD) emerges at the intersection of diffusion, flow-based training, and recent attempts to compress sampling into a handful of steps. DDPM established the diffusion paradigm\u2019s fidelity but also the core bottleneck of slow inference, later framed in continuous time via score-based SDEs and the probability flow ODE, which provided a deterministic generative path. Flow Matching formalized training ODE-based generative models by regressing vector fields along probability paths, offering a practical alternative to diffusion training. In parallel, Consistency Models sought one- or few-step generation by enforcing self-consistency along probability-flow trajectories, but suffered from instability and lacked distribution-level guarantees. Distillation approaches such as Progressive Distillation accelerated sampling but required a pre-trained teacher and multi-stage optimization, creating significant engineering overhead and sensitivity. MMSD directly addresses these gaps by importing the classical idea of moment matching from Generative Moment Matching Networks into the flow/diffusion trajectory setting, and by doing so in a single-stage self-distillation framework. Rather than regressing scores or vector fields or relying on teacher signals, MMSD enforces equality of carefully chosen moments across the generative trajectory, yielding stability across hyperparameters and theoretical distribution-level convergence. This lineage\u2014diffusion and ODE views (DDPM, score-based SDEs), flow-based training (Flow Matching), and accelerated few-step paradigms with their limitations (Consistency Models, Progressive Distillation)\u2014culminates in MMSD\u2019s inductive moment-matching formulation for fast, stable, and theoretically principled few-step generation.",
