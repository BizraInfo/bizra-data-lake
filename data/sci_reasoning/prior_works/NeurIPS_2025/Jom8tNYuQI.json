  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014diffusion generative modeling directly in Lie group representation space\u2014sits at the intersection of score matching, SDE-based diffusion, manifold diffusion, and representation-theoretic equivariance. At its foundation, Hyv\u00e4rinen\u2019s score matching (2005) supplies the learning principle that the authors recover as a special case when the Lie group is the translation group. Crucially, Hyv\u00e4rinen\u2019s extensions (2007) on generalized score matching motivate the move from standard gradients to operator-defined scores; this paper instantiates those operators via Lie algebra representations, enabling consistent learning on non-Abelian groups.\nSong et al. (2021) provided the reverse-time SDE framework for score-based generative modeling; the present work generalizes this to non-commutative settings by deriving paired SDEs and a class of Langevin dynamics compatible with the direct-sum decomposition of Lie algebra representations. While Riemannian score-based methods (De Bortoli et al., 2022) established diffusion on manifolds, they operate in coordinate charts or intrinsic geometries; the new approach shifts to representation space, avoiding coordinate singularities and aligning dynamics with group structure, which the experiments show to be advantageous on SO(3) and SE(3) tasks.\nThis construction is informed by representation-theoretic deep learning. Group-equivariant CNNs (Cohen & Welling, 2016) and Tensor Field Networks (Thomas et al., 2018) demonstrate how irreducible representations and Lie algebra actions structure feature spaces; the paper adopts a similar decomposition to design diffusion dynamics. Finally, application-driven SE(3) diffusion successes in docking (DiffDock, 2023) highlight the importance of rotational-translational generative models, providing a benchmark where the proposed representation-space diffusion yields improved performance.",
