  "synthesis_narrative": "SEDD\u2019s key contribution is to recover the theoretical backbone of score-based learning for discrete variables by replacing continuous gradients with probability ratios. The lineage begins with score matching (Hyv\u00e4rinen, 2005), which frames learning via the Fisher divergence between data and model scores; this underpins modern score-based generative modeling (Song & Ermon, 2019) and diffusion learning (Ho et al., 2020). However, these rely on gradients of log densities and thus do not directly extend to discrete domains. Prior attempts at discrete diffusion (Austin et al., 2021) and text generation with diffusion (Li et al., 2022) established viable forward corruption processes and reverse models but lacked a principled score-matching analogue, contributing to weaker likelihoods and gaps to autoregressive models.\n\nSEDD closes this gap by reframing the objective around estimable probability ratios, drawing on the discrete-domain insight of ratio matching (Hyv\u00e4rinen, 2007) and the broader density-ratio paradigm exemplified by NCE (Gutmann & Hyv\u00e4rinen, 2010). Conceptually, SEDD treats the corruption process as defining local neighborhoods and learns log-probability ratios that play the role of scores on discrete spaces. This \u2018score entropy\u2019 loss preserves the spirit of score matching while remaining computable without continuous derivatives or normalized likelihoods, and integrates seamlessly into the diffusion framework. The synthesis of score-based diffusion with ratio-based estimation yields discrete diffusion models that substantially improve perplexity and text fidelity, narrowing or surpassing the performance gap to autoregressive baselines.",
