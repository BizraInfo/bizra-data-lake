  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s main contribution\u2014estimating visitation pseudocounts in high-dimensional RL via coin flips and a supervised loss\u2014emerges from two converging lines of work. First, classical count-based exploration (MBIE-EB) established the value of bonuses that scale with visitation counts, creating a need to recover N(s,a) beyond tabular settings. Bellemare et al. then unified count-based exploration with intrinsic motivation through density-model pseudocounts, and Ostrovski et al. operationalized this with PixelCNN, but both inherit the difficulty and computational cost of accurate high-dimensional density modeling; these limitations are the explicit target of the present method. Second, Tang et al. demonstrated that approximate counting could bypass density estimation via random projections and hashing, pointing to randomization as a viable bridge from high-dimensional observations to count-like signals.\n\nThe new insight connects this RL context to data-stream algorithms: CountSketch shows that Rademacher-signed averaging gives unbiased frequency estimates. The authors recast that identity into a learnable form: a simple supervised objective on Rademacher (coin-flip) labels whose optimum recovers visitation counts, avoiding explicit density models while retaining count-based bonuses. This supervised reduction echoes the spirit of Noise-Contrastive Estimation\u2014turning unsupervised quantities into supervised learning targets\u2014while differing in its goal (counts, not densities). Finally, compared to exploration-by-prediction-error approaches like Random Network Distillation, the coin-flip method preserves the interpretability and calibration of count-based exploration, yielding a principled and empirically stronger intrinsic bonus.",
