  "synthesis_narrative": "Dynalang\u2019s core innovation\u2014treating diverse natural language as a predictive signal within a multimodal world model that supports imagined rollouts\u2014arises from merging two lines of work. The first is the model-based RL lineage of Dyna and Dreamer: Sutton\u2019s Dyna formalized learning and planning through a learned model, and Dreamer operationalized this at scale using latent dynamics and imagination to train policies and value functions. Dynalang retains this learn\u2013imagine\u2013act backbone but expands what the model predicts beyond images and rewards to include language. The second line stems from multimodal video\u2013language modeling, exemplified by MERLOT Reserve, which showed that predicting language jointly with visual context cultivates temporal and semantic understanding. Dynalang transposes this idea into agentic learning, using free-form language\u2014not only instructions but also descriptions, feedback, and general knowledge\u2014as predictive supervision for the dynamics model. In contrast to instruction-centric systems like SayCan and embodied LLMs such as PaLM-E, which leverage language at decision time or via supervised behavior cloning, Dynalang embeds language into the forward model itself, enabling self-supervised representation learning that improves future prediction and downstream control. The result is a unified framework where language understanding and world prediction are the same objective, directly enabling better planning from imagined rollouts and closing the gap between passive multimodal modeling and model-based action.",
