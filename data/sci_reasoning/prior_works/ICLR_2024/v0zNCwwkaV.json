  "synthesis_narrative": "Softmax attention, introduced by Vaswani et al., computes D^{-1} exp(QK^T) V, with expressivity fundamentally tied to pairwise dot-products between token embeddings. Kar and Karnick showed that exponentiated dot-product kernels decompose into sums of tensor powers, revealing that exp(q\u00b7k) implicitly aggregates interactions of all orders via tensor products. Performer operationalized this kernel perspective in practical attention by factorizing exp(q\u00b7k) with feature maps, establishing that the softmax kernel admits structured decompositions amenable to efficient computation. In parallel, compact bilinear pooling demonstrated that explicit outer-product (tensor) interactions can be harnessed and manipulated with sketching for richer feature fusion, while Bilinear Attention Networks validated that moving beyond simple dot-products to bilinear pooling strengthens relational reasoning. Complementing these method ideas, Hahn\u2019s theory highlighted that standard self-attention can fail on certain combinatorial dependencies, underscoring the need for mechanisms that go past pairwise correlations. Together, these works suggested a natural path: retain the normalized softmax structure of attention but replace its pairwise dot-product core with tensorized/Kronecker computations that explicitly model higher-order interactions. The present paper follows this path by generalizing the matrix softmax attention operator to a Kronecker-based formulation over tuples of words, thereby capturing triple-wise correlations while leveraging the kernel and tensor-product insights to preserve a computable, structured normalization analogous to standard attention.",

Here, $\\exp()$ is applied entry-wise and ${\\bf 1}_n$ denotes a length-$n$ vector whose entries are all ones.\n\nIntuitively, attention computation captures pairwise information between words in a sentence, but not higher-order information. Indeed, recent work \\cite{sht23} has shown that attention units cannot solve simple problems about detecting triples of connected words.\n\nIn this work, we study a generalization of attention which captures triple-wise  correlations. The generalization is based on computations involving tensors defined by tuples of words. More formally, given five $n \\times d$ size matrices $Q, K_1, K_2, V_1$ and $V_2$ (generalized query, key, and value tokens), our new goal is to compute an $n \\tim",
