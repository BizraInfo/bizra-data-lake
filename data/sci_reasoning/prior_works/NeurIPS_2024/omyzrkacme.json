  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution is to reconcile the Coasean prescription\u2014internalize externalities via property rights and bargaining\u2014with the reality of imperfect knowledge by embedding it in a two-player bandit game and adopting hindsight rationality (no-regret learning) as the behavioral benchmark. Coase\u2019s foundational insight motivates the use of transfers to align incentives, but the classic theorem presumes full information; here, regret-minimizing agents learn their payoffs and externalities on the fly. The learning side is grounded in bandit methodology (Auer et al.), providing finite-time regret guarantees under partial feedback that instantiate hindsight rationality. On the game-theoretic side, Hart\u2013Mas-Colell\u2019s linkage between no-regret dynamics and equilibrium legitimizes hindsight rationality as a robust behavioral assumption. Crucially, the smoothness framework of Syrgkanis and Tardos supplies the analytical bridge: it shows that no-regret behavior in mechanisms with quasilinear transfers yields near-optimal welfare, an idea the present work adapts to environments with externalities and bandit feedback. Prior work in bandit mechanism design (Babaioff\u2013Kleinberg\u2013Slivkins) and on incentivizing exploration (Frazier\u2013Kempe\u2013Kleinberg) demonstrates how payments can be designed to overcome information and exploration externalities, directly informing the paper\u2019s property-rights/bargaining layer. Finally, multi-agent bandit studies with interference (Rosenski\u2013Shamir\u2013Szlak) provide algorithmic templates and convergence tools relevant to learning under cross-player effects. Together, these strands enable a learning-theoretic extension of the Coase theorem with formal welfare guarantees under hindsight-rational behavior.",
