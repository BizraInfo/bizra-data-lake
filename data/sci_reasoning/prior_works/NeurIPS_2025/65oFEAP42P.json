  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014computing the optimal fairness\u2013performance Pareto front without training complex models\u2014emerges from unifying structural insights about optimal fair decisions with reductionist optimization techniques. Early representation-learning work by Zemel et al. established the fairness\u2013utility trade-off and popularized fair representations, while adversarial approaches like Edwards and Storkey refined this paradigm but at the cost of heavy modeling. In contrast, Hardt et al. provided a geometric and probabilistic characterization of optimal fair classifiers via ROC convexification and group-specific thresholding, revealing discrete structure (thresholds and randomization) that directly suggests compact representations of the trade-off surface. Menon and Williamson further formalized the \u201cprice of fairness,\u201d proving threshold optimality under various constraints and clarifying the geometry of Pareto-optimal solutions. On the algorithmic side, Zafar et al. and Agarwal et al. showed that fairness-constrained learning can be reframed as convex or cost-sensitive optimization, legitimizing reductions that trade modeling complexity for principled optimization. Building on these, the present paper derives structural properties of optimal fair representations and classifiers that reduce Pareto-front computation to a compact discrete problem, then solves the resulting difference-of-convex formulations efficiently using CCCP (Yuille and Rangarajan). The synthesis yields an end-to-end methodology that bypasses training complex fair-representation models while delivering exact, efficiently computable Pareto fronts for both representations and classifiers.",
