  "synthesis_narrative": "Good formalized the missing mass and the Good\u2013Turing coverage estimate, tying the probability of unseen outcomes to the singleton count f1/n. Gale and Sampson later introduced Simple Good\u2013Turing, smoothing the noisy frequency-of-frequencies by regressing across fk to control variance, making fk the practical substrate for unseen estimation. Efron and Thisted advanced unseen prediction by exploiting the entire fingerprint via Poissonization and a series expansion over fk, demonstrating that forward predictions of discovery can be expressed through all frequencies-of-frequencies rather than just f1. Valiant and Valiant showed that symmetric distribution properties can be estimated with linear functionals of the fingerprint and that such linear estimators can be near-optimal, elevating fk from a heuristic summary to a principled sufficient object for property estimation. Orlitsky and colleagues then analyzed profile-based estimators competitively, explaining when Good\u2013Turing works and when it fails in heavy tails, pointing to the need for profile-dependent yet more adaptive weighting across fk. Finally, Jiao and coauthors framed property estimation as an optimization problem, designing linear/polynomial estimators by explicitly trading bias and variance.\n\nTogether these works reveal that unseen-related quantities are fundamentally profile-dependent, that relying solely on f1 induces variance/bias pathologies, and that linear fk-weighting can be optimized. The paper synthesizes these insights by proving the expected missing mass is determined by the full fingerprint (up to an exponentially small error) and then operationalizing this through an optimization over nearly unbiased fk-linear estimators to minimize MSE from the observed sample\u2014turning profile sufficiency into a concrete, distribution-specific estimator design.",

However, our theory suggests a large search space of nearly unbiased estimators that can be searched effectively and efficiently. Hence, we cast distribution-free estimation as an optimization problem to find a distribution-specific estimator with a minimized mean-squared error (MSE), given only the sample.\nIn our experiments, our search algorithm discovers estimators that have",
