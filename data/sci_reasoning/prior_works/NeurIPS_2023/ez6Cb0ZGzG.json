  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014continual training of an instruction-following agent from realtime binary user feedback via a contextual bandit formulation\u2014sits at the intersection of human-in-the-loop reinforcement, bandit learning, and interactive language grounding. The contextual bandit view of per-interaction learning from Li et al. provides the fundamental reduction the authors adopt to turn instantaneous user signals into immediate rewards for online policy improvement. Swaminathan and Joachims\u2019 counterfactual risk minimization principles inform how to treat noisy, biased human feedback and guide choices for robust estimation and evaluation under bandit feedback. Building on these foundations, Kreutzer et al. show that sequence models can be optimized directly from partial (bandit) signals, bridging the gap from abstract bandit theory to practical updates for language-conditioned policies.\nConcurrently, the TAMER line (Knox & Stone; Warnell et al.) establishes that realtime human evaluative feedback can effectively shape agent behavior, and that such feedback scales to deep models\u2014directly echoing the paper\u2019s conversion of binary clicks into immediate rewards and its deployed, continual-learning setup. Christiano et al. demonstrates the broader potential of learning complex behaviors from human feedback (RLHF), motivating the use of human judgments as a primary supervision channel, even when explicit demonstrations are scarce. Finally, Thomason et al. ground the viability of interactive learning in instruction-following domains, showing that improvements can accrue from user interactions. The present paper synthesizes these threads by deploying a live, contextual-bandit learner that translates realtime binary feedback into reward, continually updates the policy during interaction, and empirically shows gains comparable to supervised demonstrations.",
