  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014demonstrating that continuous attractor computation can be embedded within fast, irregular E\u2013I balanced dynamics by separating synapses into strong/fast and weak/slow sets\u2014sits at the intersection of three lines of work. First, balanced network theory (van Vreeswijk & Sompolinsky; Brunel) established that sparse random E\u2013I connectivity with sufficiently strong interactions produces asynchronous, irregular activity governed by fast synaptic kinetics. This provides the fast, high-variance background dynamics the present study explicitly harnesses with its strong, fast synapses.\nSecond, continuous attractor neural networks (Ben-Yishai et al.; Zhang) showed that stable bump manifolds arise from structured recurrent interactions, offering a canonical mechanism for representing continuous variables. The current paper instantiates this with a weak structured component that is intentionally slow, ensuring that attractor dynamics evolve on timescales distinct from the fast balanced fluctuations.\nThird, prior demonstrations that structured connectivity can coexist with balanced dynamics (Litwin-Kumar & Doiron) and that weak low-rank structure embedded in random networks yields computationally meaningful slow modes (Mastrogiuseppe & Ostojic) directly motivate the architectural decomposition used here. Complementing these, Brunel & Wang\u2019s separation of fast AMPA/GABA and slow NMDA currents foreshadows the two-timescale synaptic design, now generalized to a random balanced substrate with a weak, slow CANN. Together, these works converge on the insight that a slow, low-amplitude structured component can carve an attractor manifold within a fast, strongly balanced random network, enabling coexistence and mutual compatibility of E\u2013I irregularity and continuous attractor computation.",
