  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation\u2014near mixing-free sharp rates for squared-loss ERM with dependent data\u2014arises from reconciling two strands of work: learning under dependence and sharp excess-risk analysis. Classical learning results for mixing processes (Yu, 1994; Mohri & Rostamizadeh, 2010) transfer i.i.d. tools via blocking or effective sample size, but they inherently impose a multiplicative penalty tied to dependence coefficients. Complementary concentration results for dependent sequences (Merlev\u00e8de\u2013Peligrad\u2013Rio, 2009; Samson, 2000) likewise embed mixing into the variance proxy, reinforcing the prevailing belief that dependence must deteriorate leading terms. In contrast, sharp i.i.d. excess-risk theory (Bartlett\u2013Bousquet\u2013Mendelson, 2005) shows that for square loss the dominant term should be governed by localized complexity and second-order statistics. The technical bridge our paper builds uses two key empirical-process tools: Adamczak\u2019s Orlicz-\u03a8_\u03b1 framework for handling unbounded function classes and Dirksen\u2019s mixed-tail generic chaining that controls suprema using dual metrics. By imposing comparability of \u03a8_p and L^2 topologies on the hypothesis class, we leverage mixed-tail chaining to decouple the leading error term from dependence, pushing mixing effects into additive, higher-order remainders. Thus, our contribution directly extends Adamczak\u2019s and Dirksen\u2019s techniques to the dependent setting while resolving the gap left by block-based and mixing-inflated analyses, restoring the i.i.d.-like, variance-driven sharp rates for square loss under \u03b2-mixing.",
