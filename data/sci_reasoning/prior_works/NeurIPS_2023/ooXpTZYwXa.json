  "synthesis_narrative": "Point-In-Context extends the in-context learning paradigm to 3D point clouds by treating both inputs and outputs uniformly as coordinate tokens and performing masked prediction conditioned on demonstrations at inference time. The conceptual backbone is GPT-3\u2019s few-shot ICL, which inspires test-time adaptation without gradient updates. In vision, MAE reveals that masked token reconstruction can induce strong emergent capabilities, suggesting that masked modeling could serve as a mechanism for visual ICL; Point-In-Context adapts this idea to 3D, where the tokens are the point coordinates themselves. Perceiver IO contributes the key abstraction of flexible, query-based inputs/outputs, encouraging a universal coordinate-as-token interface that spans multiple 3D tasks under a single inference-time prompting protocol.\n\nTranslating masked modeling to 3D requires grappling with how tokens and positions are defined. Point-BERT and Point-MAE pioneered masked point modeling, exposing practical design issues\u2014tokenization via patches, reconstruction targets, and positional encodings\u2014that can inadvertently leak location information. Point-In-Context directly addresses this leakage risk by redesigning the positional treatment and coordinating sampling at test time. Building on PointNet++\u2019s farthest point sampling, the proposed Joint Sampling module jointly selects support and query sets to align distributions and minimize information leakage through sampling or positional bias. Finally, Point Transformer\u2019s relative position mechanisms inform how to structure attention over coordinates without relying on absolute positions, stabilizing the coordinate-token attention that underpins in-context inference for 3D point cloud understanding.",
