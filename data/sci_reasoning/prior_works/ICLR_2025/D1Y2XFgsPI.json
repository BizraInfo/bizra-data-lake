  "synthesis_narrative": "Rubin\u2019s multiple imputation framework established principled inference with missing data, shaping decades of practice that implicitly equated better imputation with better downstream analyses. MICE operationalized this idea via chained equations, becoming the default advanced pipeline for tabular missingness, while missForest demonstrated strong nonparametric imputations for mixed data and GAIN pushed imputation accuracy further with deep adversarial training. In parallel, Saar-Tsechansky and Provost showed that explicitly modeling missingness\u2014through indicators or selective imputation\u2014can boost predictive accuracy, highlighting that missingness patterns themselves may be informative. Clinical guidance by Groenwold and colleagues cautioned against missing-indicator methods for estimation, implicitly separating inferential validity from predictive utility. Most crucially, theoretical results by Le Morvan and collaborators showed that simple constant imputation, especially paired with missingness indicators, can be consistent and competitive for prediction with linear models, reframing imputation as a means to minimize predictive risk rather than solely to reconstruct data. Together, these works revealed a gap: despite increasingly accurate imputers, evidence was mixed on whether such gains translate into better predictions, particularly with expressive learners and when missingness is modeled directly. The current paper synthesizes these insights by systematically quantifying the returns from imputation accuracy to predictive performance across diverse datasets and model classes, showing diminishing gains with expressive models and consistent benefits from missingness indicators\u2014even under MCAR\u2014thereby clarifying when investment in advanced imputation is warranted for prediction.",

    "abstract": "Missing values are prevalent across various fields, posing challenges for training and deploying predictive models. In this context, imputation is a common practice, driven by the hope that accurate imputations will enhance predictions. However, recent theoretical and empirical studies indicate that simple constant imputation can be consistent and competitive. This empirical study aims at clarifying \n*if* and *when* investing in advanced imputation methods yields significantly better predictions. Relating imputation and predictive accuracies across combinations of imputation and predictive models on 19 datasets, we show that imputation accuracy matters less i) when using expressive models, ii) when incorporating missingness indicators as complementary inputs, iii) matters much more for generated linear outcomes than for real-data outcomes. Interestingly, we also show that the use of the missingness indicator is beneficial to the prediction performance, even in MCAR scenarios. Overall, ",
