  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper probes whether neuron-specific embeddings\u2014linear readout weights from a shared nonlinear core\u2014are reproducible across model architectures and random initializations, and it introduces an adaptive sparsity scheme to stabilize and structure those embeddings. This contribution is rooted in the shared-core/linear-readout paradigm introduced for large-scale neural system identification by Klindt et al., where the factorized readout (\u2018what\u2019 and \u2018where\u2019) made the feature-weight vector a natural functional embedding. Subsequent advances by Cadena et al. and Lurz et al. refined these architectures for visual cortex, showing that structured readouts and appropriate regularization improve predictive accuracy and interpretability; these works establish the practical setting and baselines for evaluating embedding stability in mouse V1.\nAt a conceptual level, Locatello et al. highlighted the non-identifiability of overparameterized models without inductive biases, motivating the present study\u2019s central question: are such embeddings unique and meaningful, or artifacts of training contingencies? To rigorously compare learned solutions across seeds and architectures, the paper leverages representation-comparison principles typified by Kornblith et al.\u2019s CKA, quantifying alignment and reproducibility. Empirically, the authors find that L1 regularization is a key inductive bias that yields structured, interpretable embeddings\u2014directly grounded in the Lasso framework. Building on this, they propose an adaptive regularization scheme inspired by reweighted/adaptive L1 ideas (e.g., Cand\u00e8s et al.), which tailors penalty strengths to produce more stable and meaningful neuron embeddings suitable for downstream analyses such as clustering into functional types.",
