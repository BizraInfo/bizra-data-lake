  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014d-DRFWL(2), a distance-restricted Folklore 2-WL GNN that provably counts cycles while remaining efficient\u2014sits at the intersection of WL theory, higher-order GNN design, and subgraph-centric expressivity. Weisfeiler and Leman\u2019s original color refinement underpins the idea of coloring ordered node pairs and propagating information among them, the very mechanics that give 2-WL its ability to discern and count cyclic structures. Xu et al. formalized the expressive ceiling of standard MPNNs via 1-WL equivalence, crystallizing the need to go beyond neighborhood aggregation to capture cycles. Morris et al. then mapped k-WL (including pairwise 2-WL/folklore) into neural architectures, showing their superior substructure-counting power but also their quadratic or worse scaling. In parallel, Maron et al. demonstrated that higher-order equivariant networks can provably count motifs like triangles, yet at significant computational cost, reinforcing the need for practical approximations. Subgraph methods such as SEAL and GSN validated that injecting subgraph/motif context enables cycle counting in practice, but they rely on heavy preprocessing\u2014extracting bags of subgraphs or precomputing motif counts. Relational Pooling further illustrates that maximal expressivity is achievable but computationally prohibitive. d-DRFWL(2) synthesizes these strands: it retains the 2-WL pairwise expressive advantages responsible for cycle counting while sidestepping both higher-order tensor blow-ups and subgraph/motif preprocessing by restricting pairwise message passing to pairs within a bounded graph distance, delivering a provably cycle-counting yet scalable GNN.",
