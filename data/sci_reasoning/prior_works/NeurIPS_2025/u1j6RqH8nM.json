  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014a quantitative framework that maps general capability to oversight success via an oversight-specific Elo with two plateaus\u2014synthesizes ideas from scalable oversight, scaling laws, and rating-based evaluation. AI Safety via Debate provides the foundational lens of treating supervision as a competitive game where weaker agents can still elicit truthful information from stronger ones; this directly motivates modeling oversight as capability-mismatched play. Constitutional AI operationalizes scalable oversight through AI feedback, demonstrating that an AI judge can supervise another model, thereby motivating a parametric notion of overseer capability. Weak-to-Strong Generalization brings the central empirical question into focus: when and how often can a weaker overseer successfully supervise a stronger system? This informs the paper\u2019s emphasis on success probabilities under capability mismatch.\nELK crystallizes the failure modes when overseers cannot access or evaluate the model\u2019s internal knowledge, justifying the incompetence plateau and the separation between general intelligence and oversight-specific skill. From the methodological side, Kaplan et al.\u2019s scaling laws underpin the idea that performance can be predicted as a smooth function of scale; the present work extends this paradigm to oversight outcomes. Schaeffer et al.\u2019s analysis of emergent abilities as mirages suggests piecewise-linear behavior with apparent thresholds, inspiring the two-plateau oversight-Elo mapping (incompetence to saturation). Finally, Elo-based evaluations in Chatbot Arena validate using rating systems to aggregate pairwise outcomes across agents, directly informing the paper\u2019s formalism and its empirical applications to debate, Mafia, backdoor code detection, and wargames.",
