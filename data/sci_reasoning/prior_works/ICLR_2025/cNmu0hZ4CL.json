  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014an optimal transport distance between noisy neural trajectories modeled as Gaussian processes\u2014sits at the intersection of representational similarity analysis, neural time-series modeling, and Wasserstein geometry. Kriegeskorte et al. (2008) established the foundational goal of comparing representational geometries across systems, a task for which SVCCA (Raghu et al., 2017) and especially CKA (Kornblith et al., 2019) became standard baselines. However, these tools largely treat responses as deterministic and static, a mismatch for biological systems with trial-to-trial variability and temporally unfolding population activity. Walther et al. (2016) crystallized how noise biases similarity measures and introduced noise-unbiased distances, motivating the present work to handle noise rigorously\u2014not only in magnitude but also in its temporal covariance. To do so, the authors adopt the Gaussian process view of neural population trajectories introduced by Yu et al. (2009), which provides a probabilistic, time-continuous representation of dynamics and variability. The key mathematical step then leverages optimal transport theory specialized to Gaussian measures: Gelbrich (1990) supplies the closed-form 2-Wasserstein distance for Gaussian measures (including in Hilbert spaces), and Takatsu (2011) characterizes the Wasserstein geometry of Gaussians via the Bures\u2013Wasserstein metric. Building directly on these results, the paper derives a principled OT distance between Gaussian processes, yielding a metric that remains sensitive to geometric differences in dynamics while correctly accounting for structured noise\u2014thereby overcoming the central limitations of RSA/CKA-style baselines.",
