  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014unbiased gradient estimation for zeroth-order optimization from function evaluations\u2014emerges by unifying two lines of work: classical smoothing-based gradient-free optimization and debiasing via randomized telescoping. Smoothing methods from bandit/zeroth-order optimization (Flaxman\u2013Kalai\u2013McMahan; Nesterov\u2013Spokoiny) and perturbation schemes like SPSA (Spall) enabled efficient gradient surrogates using one- or two-point evaluations, but are intrinsically biased for the original objective unless the stepsize vanishes. The authors directly tackle this barrier by recasting directional derivatives as a telescoping series across scales and then invoking unbiased estimation via randomized truncation (Rhee\u2013Glynn), a technique rooted in MLMC-style decompositions (Giles). This perspective yields a family of function-evaluation\u2013only estimators whose expectations equal the true gradient, while judicious level distributions and perturbation stepsizes control variance and cost, echoing multilevel variance\u2013cost balancing.\n\nOn the algorithmic and theoretical side, the work builds upon established complexity analyses for zeroth-order SGD in smooth nonconvex settings (Ghadimi\u2013Lan), ensuring the new unbiased estimators can be dropped into standard SGD and still attain optimal convergence. Minimax insights and two-point design principles (Duchi\u2013Jordan\u2013Wainwright\u2013Wibisono) further inform the estimator architecture and stepsize scaling, allowing the method to match best-known dimension and accuracy dependencies. Together, these prior works supply the smoothing foundations, the debiasing machinery, and the optimal-rate benchmarks that the paper synthesizes into unbiased, variance-efficient zeroth-order gradient estimators with provably optimal nonconvex performance.",
