  "synthesis_narrative": "Deep Submodular Peripteral Networks (DSPNs) unify advances in submodular modeling, set-function neural architectures, and psychometric preference learning. Early work by Lin and Bilmes demonstrated that submodular objectives can be learned from data via mixtures, while Iyer and Bilmes introduced parametric submodular families such as submodular Hamming metrics\u2014both directly motivating DSPN\u2019s pursuit of an expressive, trainable submodular function class. In parallel, Deep Sets provided the neural template for permutation-invariant set-function approximators; DSPNs build on this blueprint but add structural guarantees by enforcing submodularity, ensuring principled combinatorial behavior in selection and summarization tasks.\n\nFor supervision, standard ML practice often relies on binary pairwise preference models epitomized by Bradley\u2013Terry and widely operationalized in RLHF (e.g., Ouyang et al.), but such signals are information-thin and typically contrast only two items. DSPNs instead draw from psychometrics: Thurstone\u2019s comparative judgment and, especially, Saaty\u2019s Analytic Hierarchy Process, which pioneered graded pairwise comparisons with intensity scales and consistency considerations. These foundations directly inform DSPN\u2019s peripteral loss, which exploits numerically graded relationships and supports comparisons between sets of arbitrary size, extracting richer learning signals than binary rankings. By marrying a deep, parametric submodular architecture with graded-comparison training, DSPNs bridge classical submodular learning and modern preference-based training, yielding a practical pathway to learn powerful submodular functions from nuanced human-like judgments.",
