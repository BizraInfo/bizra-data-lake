  "synthesis_narrative": "Moirai\u2019s core contribution\u2014a masked encoder-based universal Transformer that learns across datasets, frequencies, and variable dimensionalities\u2014sits at the intersection of universal pretraining, scalable Transformer design for time series, and distribution-robust learning. The universal-forecasting impetus comes directly from foundation-model efforts such as Chronos, which showed that broad pretraining yields strong zero-shot transfer across tasks and sampling rates; Moirai adopts this goal while favoring a continuous, non-tokenized architecture tuned to forecasting. Architecturally, Moirai leverages the Transformer lineage and efficiency lessons from Informer to remain tractable at universal scale. To unify disparate sampling frequencies, it draws on the encoder-only, patch-based processing exemplified by ViT, allowing different resolutions to be embedded into a common latent space. The masked-encoder training paradigm of MAE maps naturally to time series, enabling robust representation learning under missingness and flexible horizons without a heavy decoder, which Moirai operationalizes for forecasting rather than reconstruction alone. Handling arbitrary numbers of variates is informed by iTransformer\u2019s view of channels as tokens, guiding Moirai toward designs that decouple model capacity from a fixed dimensionality. Finally, RevIN\u2019s normalization insights and DeepAR\u2019s probabilistic framing underscore Moirai\u2019s distribution-aware training over heterogeneous corpora. Together, these works directly shape Moirai\u2019s unified training recipe for a single, universal time-series forecasting Transformer.",
