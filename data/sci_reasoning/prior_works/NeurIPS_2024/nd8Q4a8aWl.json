  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core idea\u2014estimating local intrinsic dimension (LID) from the Fokker\u2013Planck (FP) dynamics induced by a pretrained diffusion model\u2014sits at the confluence of manifold geometry, classical LID estimation, and modern score-based generative modeling. Diffusion Maps established that short-time diffusion/heat-kernel behavior reflects manifold geometry, including dimensionality via characteristic scaling. Classical LID estimators, notably Levina and Bickel\u2019s local MLE and Houle\u2019s formalization of LID as a pointwise tail-exponent, defined the target quantity and highlighted its utility but suffer from high variance, sensitivity to neighborhood selection, and scalability issues in high dimensions.\n\nDiffusion probabilistic models provided a new lever: Sohl-Dickstein et al. introduced the forward\u2013reverse diffusion paradigm, while Ho et al. delivered a practical training recipe that yields robust, widely available pretrained models. Song et al. unified diffusion models with stochastic differential equations, making explicit the FP/continuity equations that tie time evolution of densities to the score field and drift\u2014a mathematical bridge crucial for deriving a local dimension estimator from model-implied dynamics. Vincent\u2019s denoising score matching result guarantees that noise-conditional denoisers learned during diffusion training estimate the score of smoothed densities, giving reliable access to \u2207 log pt(x) required by the FP identity.\n\nTogether, these works directly enable the paper\u2019s contribution: a theoretically grounded, efficient LID estimator that extracts local dimensionality from the FP dynamics of a single pretrained diffusion model, improving accuracy and computational practicality over kNN-based and prior generative-model approaches.",
