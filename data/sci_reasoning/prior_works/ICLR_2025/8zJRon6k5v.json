  "synthesis_narrative": "Variational Sequential Monte Carlo framed latent variable learning in terms of Feynman\u2013Kac path measures and introduced a tight ELBO using sequential proposals, establishing the variational machinery and objective that enable path-space inference. Building on the same Feynman\u2013Kac formalism, Controlled Sequential Monte Carlo showed that the optimal way to condition on observations is via the Doob h-transform and proposed a variational control approximation, clarifying that \u2018twisting\u2019 can be learned. In continuous time, guided diffusion bridge methods make the Doob h-transform concrete by adjusting SDE drifts to target observation-conditioned trajectories, providing a constructive blueprint for conditioning dynamics. Schr\u00f6dinger bridge methods further recast conditioning as a stochastic optimal control problem over path measures, linking desirability functions to the Doob transform and suggesting variational objectives that target the posterior dynamics. Meanwhile, Latent ODEs and Neural CDEs established continuous-time latent modeling for irregular sampling but lacked a principled multi-marginal conditioning mechanism and typically relied on forward simulation rather than posterior-driven dynamics. Conditional Flow Matching introduced simulation-free training for conditional flows, showing how to learn vector fields that satisfy boundary constraints without trajectory simulation.\nThese strands together exposed a natural opportunity: use the Doob h-transform as the canonical target for observation-conditioned dynamics, approximate it via stochastic optimal control in a variational framework compatible with Feynman\u2013Kac ELBOs, and implement it in a continuous-time model for irregular observations with simulation-free training. ACSSM synthesizes these insights by formulating a multi-marginal Doob transform for irregularly sampled constraints, amortizing the associated control to yield scalable inference and learning, and incorporating a simulation-free latent dynamics parameterization to improve efficiency while preserving a tight ELBO.",

In this paper, we propose the Amortized Control of continuous State Space Model (ACSSM) for continuous dynamical modeling of time series for irregular and discrete observations. We first present a multi-marginal Doob's $h$-transform to construct a continuous dynamical system conditioned on these irregular observations. Following this, we introduce a variational inference algorithm with a tight evidence lower bound (ELBO), leveraging stochastic optimal control (SOC) theory to approximate the intractable Doob's $h$-transform and simulate the conditioned dynamics. To improve efficiency and scalability during both training and inference, ACSSM leverages auxiliary variable to flexibly parameterize the latent dynamics and amortized control. Additionally, it incorporates a simulation-free latent dynamics framework and a transformer-b",
