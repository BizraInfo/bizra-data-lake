  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of this paper\u2014replacing single-modality scoring with a CLIP-powered, multimodal framework for robust and generalizable data selection\u2014rests on the representational foundation established by CLIP (Radford et al.), whose aligned vision\u2013language space enables cross-modal assessment of sample quality. Early demonstrations that CLIP similarity can effectively clean real-world web data in LAION-5B (Schuhmann et al.) directly inspired the use of multimodal signals for data curation. DataComp (Gadre et al.) further crystallized the value of CLIP-based filtering but focused on pretraining-time curation; the present work addresses this gap by extending multimodal selection to task-agnostic, downstream data selection with modules for adaptation, scoring, and redundancy control.\n\nAgainst established single-modality baselines, the framework specifically improves upon GLISTER and GradMatch (Killamsetty et al.) by substituting gradient/validation-loss criteria with CLIP-driven signals, thereby mitigating sensitivity to noisy labels and distribution shift while targeting generalization. Methodologically, the approach extends the classic coverage/diversity rationale of Core-Set selection (Sener & Savarese) by operating in CLIP\u2019s joint embedding space, ensuring that selected subsets capture semantic variety aligned with language supervision. Finally, it draws on insights from SemDeDup (Cherti et al.) that CLIP embeddings can detect semantic redundancy, integrating this idea into a broader selection pipeline rather than deduplication alone. Together, these works directly shaped the paper\u2019s central idea: multimodal, CLIP-based selection yields more robust and transferable subsets than traditional single-modality strategies.",
