  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution is to show that greedy information gain selection (Information Pursuit, IP) nearly reduces to Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) when queries are random projections of dictionary atoms, with the remaining difference being IP\u2019s use of normalized correlation gain. This rests on two strands of prior work. First, active testing and information-pursuit ideas (Geman & Jedynak) and the submodularity-based theory of greedy information gain (Krause et al.) formalized sequential query selection by mutual information, providing the conceptual target the authors aim to approximate efficiently. Second, OMP and its theory (Pati et al.; Tropp & Gilbert) deliver an operational greedy procedure that selects atoms by correlation with the residual, together with guarantees for sparse recovery and analysis of residual inner products. The bridge between these worlds is random projection theory (Johnson\u2013Lindenstrauss), which ensures that random queries preserve inner products (and thus the orderings induced by normalized correlations), enabling the reduction from MI-based selection to OMP-like selection. Connections to residual-correlation methods in statistics (LARS; Efron et al.) clarify the role of normalized versus unnormalized correlations in greedy selection, aligning with the paper\u2019s IP-OMP variant. Finally, information-theoretic explainability work (L2X) motivates and grounds the paper\u2019s applications: replacing expensive MI estimation with an OMP-style surrogate yields scalable, faithful explanatory feature selection consistent with an information maximization perspective.",
