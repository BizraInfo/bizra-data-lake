  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014poLinUCB and its tight regret guarantees in the presence of post-serving contexts\u2014sits squarely on the linear contextual bandit lineage and the confidence-set analysis it enabled. LinUCB (Li et al., 2010) and its formal treatment in Chu et al. (2011) supply the algorithmic scaffold: choose actions via optimistic linear predictions with uncertainty quantified by confidence ellipsoids. The regret analysis tools of Abbasi-Yadkori et al. (2011) and Dani et al. (2008), especially the self-normalized bounds and the Elliptical Potential Lemma, are the analytical backbone; this work\u2019s core technical advance is to robustify and generalize those lemmas to accommodate noisy, augmented data streams created by post-serving contexts. Conceptually, the model is motivated by settings where information arrives after an action, echoing the delayed-feedback paradigm (Joulani et al., 2013) and the broader idea that auxiliary signals can accelerate learning. Mannor and Shamir (2011) crystallized the value of side observations, and Alon et al. (2015) formalized how post-action feedback structure can be exploited; both perspectives guide treating post-serving contexts as additional, structured observations that shrink uncertainty faster. Together, these works directly inform both the design of poLinUCB\u2014an optimistic linear method augmented with post-action features\u2014and the paper\u2019s main analytical innovation: a noise-tolerant, generalized Elliptical Potential Lemma yielding tight regret despite the new post-serving information channel.",
