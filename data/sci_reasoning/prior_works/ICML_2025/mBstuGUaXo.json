  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation in Score Matching with Missing Data is to make score-based learning viable when inputs are only partially observed, via two complementary strategies: an importance-weighted estimator and a variational approach. Hyv\u00e4rinen\u2019s original score matching (2005) is the fundamental objective they must preserve, while Hyv\u00e4rinen (2007) provides key extensions that the authors explicitly aim to keep compatible under missingness. Vincent (2011) reframes score matching through denoising, offering a corruption-based lens that closely parallels the treatment of missing entries as structured corruption and motivates marginalizing unobserved components within a variational framework.\n\nSong, Garg, and Ermon (2019) introduce sliced score matching, a scalable variant widely used in practice; maintaining applicability to such extensions shapes the proposed missing-data formulations. The two proposed adaptations map naturally onto ideas from the missing-data literature: Mattei and Frellsen\u2019s MIWAE (2019) demonstrates how importance weighting and variational bounds can handle partially observed data, directly informing the paper\u2019s IW estimator and variational surrogate but now tailored to score objectives. Rubin (1976) supplies the formal assumptions (e.g., MAR) under which inverse-probability/importance weighting yields unbiasedness, supporting the finite-sample analyses the authors provide. Finally, the success of score-based generative modeling (Song and Ermon, 2019) underscores why robust score estimation under missingness matters, ensuring the adaptations integrate with diffusion-style applications and graphical model estimation. Together, these works directly shape both the problem framing and the technical machinery of the paper\u2019s IW and variational solutions.",
