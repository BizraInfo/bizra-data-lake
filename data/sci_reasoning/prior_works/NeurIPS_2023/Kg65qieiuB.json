  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s central claim\u2014that attention mechanisms cannot prevent oversmoothing and, in fact, lose expressive power exponentially\u2014sits at the intersection of two lines of prior work: GNN oversmoothing theory and matrix product dynamics. Early analyses by Li, Han, and Wu framed GCN layers as Laplacian smoothing, seeding the conceptual link between depth and homogenized node representations. Oono and Suzuki then delivered a rigorous bound: symmetric GCNs lose expressive power exponentially, formalizing oversmoothing as a depth-driven contraction. Wu et al.\u2019s Simplifying GCNs reinforced the diffusion view, clarifying how repeated propagation inherently smooths features.\nOn the architecture side, Veli\u010dkovi\u0107 et al.\u2019s Graph Attention Networks introduced adaptive, attention-weighted neighborhood aggregation\u2014fueling the belief that attention might mitigate oversmoothing. The present paper challenges that belief by modeling attention-based GNNs as nonlinear, time-varying dynamical systems and analyzing their layerwise operators as products of inhomogeneous matrices. Here, classic tools from Rota and Strang\u2019s joint spectral radius and Jungers\u2019 comprehensive treatment of switched systems provide the quantitative handle to bound contraction rates. Finally, consensus theory (Jadbabaie, Lin, Morse) offers the structural intuition: products of time-varying stochastic matrices converge to consensus, and attention-normalized aggregations share this behavior. Together, these works directly enable the authors to extend oversmoothing results from symmetric GCNs to random-walk GCNs and GATs, delivering a definitive negative result on attention\u2019s ability to avoid oversmoothing.",
