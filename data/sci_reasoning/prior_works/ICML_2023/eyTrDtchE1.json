  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of Generalized Teacher Forcing (GTF) arises at the intersection of sequence learning, chaos synchronization, and the theory of exploding gradients. Williams and Zipser\u2019s teacher forcing established the basic training paradigm of clamping inputs to ground truth, which GTF takes as its baseline. Later, scheduled sampling extended this by stochastically mixing model and ground-truth inputs, and professor forcing sought to align free-running and teacher-forced dynamics adversarially. However, these methods did not provide guarantees on stability or gradient behavior, particularly in chaotic regimes where small errors explode. Foundational analyses by Bengio et al. (1994) and Pascanu et al. (2013) diagnosed exploding/vanishing gradients and proposed heuristics like clipping, yet these do not address exponential trajectory divergence intrinsic to chaos.\n\nGTF\u2019s decisive step draws on chaos theory: Pecora and Carroll\u2019s synchronization showed that appropriately coupling systems can align even chaotic trajectories. Sussillo and Abbott\u2019s FORCE learning likewise demonstrated that feedback forcing can tame chaotic RNNs to track desired signals. GTF synthesizes these insights by introducing a principled, teacher-coupled training scheme that ensures contraction of the error dynamics, yielding provably bounded gradients at all times. In doing so, it generalizes teacher forcing beyond exposure-bias mitigation to a theoretically grounded mechanism for stable learning of chaotic dynamical systems, overcoming the limitations of prior heuristics and adversarial alignment approaches while retaining simplicity and tractability.",
