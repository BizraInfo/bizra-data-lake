  "synthesis_narrative": "ParaDiGMS starts from the canonical diffusion pipeline introduced by DDPM, where a sample is generated by a long, strictly sequential reverse-time denoising chain. The score-based SDE/ODE formulation reframes this chain as a continuous-time trajectory, opening the door to view sampling as solving a dynamical system where the whole path can be treated as a coupled object. Prior acceleration efforts like DDIM and progressive distillation demonstrate two dominant routes\u2014deterministic mappings and retraining to reduce the number of steps\u2014but both preserve or re-learn a largely sequential schedule, exposing a quality\u2013speed tradeoff.\n\nParaDiGMS takes a third path informed by parallel-in-time numerical analysis and implicit modeling. The parareal method established that one can guess future states and iteratively correct them, distributing computation across time slices and synchronizing via global consistency. Deep Equilibrium Models further show how to deploy Picard-style fixed-point solvers to find self-consistent solutions without explicit unrolling, and classical techniques like Anderson acceleration provide practical convergence speedups for such iterations. By transplanting these fixed-point, parallel-in-time principles into the diffusion context, ParaDiGMS treats the entire denoising trajectory as a variable to solve for: it initializes future-step guesses (leveraging structures made explicit by DDIM/SDE views) and refines them until the trajectory is consistent with the pretrained denoiser. This yields a method that trades compute for wall-clock speed, parallelizing steps while preserving sample quality and remaining compatible with existing pretrained diffusion models.",
