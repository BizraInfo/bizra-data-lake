  "synthesis_narrative": "LLaDA\u2019s core innovation\u2014scaling a likelihood-based diffusion model to function competitively as a large language model\u2014sits at the intersection of diffusion theory, discrete-state modeling, and masked-denoising generation. The foundational backbone is Ho et al.\u2019s DDPM, which provides the forward noising, reverse denoising, and ELBO training recipe that LLaDA repurposes for language. Austin et al.\u2019s D3PM bridges that foundation to the discrete token domain via categorical transitions and absorbing-mask dynamics, directly shaping LLaDA\u2019s forward masking process and token-level reverse modeling.\n\nOn the sequence generation side, Mask-Predict established iterative masked refinement as a viable alternative to autoregressive decoding, a procedural blueprint LLaDA echoes through its multi-step reverse denoising that predicts masked tokens. BERT and T5 contributed the practical machinery of masked and span-corruption denoising objectives and large-scale pretraining, which LLaDA reinterprets through a diffusion lens to turn masked prediction into a principled generative model with a tractable likelihood lower bound. DiT further informed architectural and scaling choices, showing that Transformers excel as diffusion backbones, a property LLaDA leverages to demonstrate strong scaling laws in language.\n\nFinally, FLAN\u2019s instruction tuning established that supervised fine-tuning unlocks instruction-following and generalization. Mirroring standard LLM pipelines, LLaDA integrates an SFT stage post-diffusion pretraining, enabling competitive instruction-following and in-context behaviors. Together, these works directly facilitated LLaDA\u2019s central contribution: replacing autoregression with a discrete diffusion paradigm that scales, trains end-to-end, and delivers ARM-comparable performance.",
