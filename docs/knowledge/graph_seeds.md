# Graph Seeds (Entry Points)

These are the canonical seed nodes for hypergraph bootstrapping.

## Seeds
- seed:genesis-lineage → 00_GENESIS/LINEAGE_START.md
- seed:node0-covenant → NODE0_GENESIS_COVENANT.md
- seed:architecture → ARCHITECTURE.md
- seed:sape → SAPE_IMPLEMENTATION_BLUEPRINT.md
- seed:taxonomy → TAXONOMY.md
- seed:ihsan → IHSAN_CONSTRAINTS.yaml
- seed:hypergraph-vision → HYPERGRAPH-RAG-VISION.md

*Use these to initialize the graph with mission, ethics, architecture, and retrieval foundations.*
