  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014a purely spectral algorithm for list-decodable covariance estimation with guarantees in relative Frobenius norm\u2014emerges from unifying three threads: spectral filtering for robust estimation, the list-decodable learning paradigm, and robust mixture-learning pipelines. Diakonikolas et al. (2016) provided the foundational spectral filtering template: iteratively identify directions of inflated variance via top eigenvectors and prune outliers. Charikar\u2013Steinhardt\u2013Valiant (2017) formalized list-decodable learning, introducing resilience/stability viewpoints that specify what must hold for the hidden inlier subset when adversaries form the majority. Building on these, robust Gaussian learning results such as Diakonikolas\u2013Kane\u2013Stewart (2019) showed spectral methods can efficiently recover mean/covariance under Huber contamination, offering technical tools\u2014eigenvalue perturbation control, reweighting, and covariance concentration\u2014that the present work refines for the harsher list-decodable regime.\nIn parallel, SoS-based advances (Hopkins\u2013Li, 2018) delivered strong robust moment/covariance and mixture-learning guarantees but at significant computational and conceptual cost. The new paper effectively \u201cspectralizes\u201d those capabilities: it secures list-decodable covariance recovery with relative Frobenius control\u2014precisely the metric needed for clustering components in GMMs\u2014without SoS. This directly enables replacing the SoS-dependent robust partial clustering subroutine in the robust GMM pipeline of Bakshi et al. (2022), yielding the first SoS-free algorithm for learning arbitrary GMMs. Analytical ideas from list-decodable regression (Karmalkar\u2013Klivans\u2013Kothari, 2019), such as resilience and anti-concentration framed for subset selection, inform the paper\u2019s spectral pruning and certification steps. Together, these works directly scaffold the paper\u2019s main algorithmic and application-level contributions.",
