  "synthesis_narrative": "Evidence that the visual system comprises distinct pathways for perception and action established that dorsal and ventral streams implement different computations, motivating analyses that respect stream-specific structure. Component-based models of fMRI, particularly the Shared Response Model, showed that brain responses can be captured by low-dimensional latent axes that summarize shared variance across subjects. In parallel, methods such as Sparse PCA and non-negative matrix factorization demonstrated that imposing sparsity yields parts-based, interpretable factors that map cleanly onto meaningful features in visual data. For comparing biological and artificial representations, representational similarity analysis provided a general geometry-based framework, and CKA offered a robust, widely used similarity measure for neural network representations. Large-scale benchmarks like Brain-Score then standardized global model\u2013brain comparisons, emphasizing that single-task DNNs can predict neural responses surprisingly well but leaving open how alignment varies across pathways and along interpretable representational axes. Taken together, these works revealed both the feasibility and the limits of current practice: low-dimensional components can summarize brain activity, sparsity yields interpretability, and alignment metrics enable model\u2013brain comparison, yet standard metrics average over dimensions and ignore pathway structure. The natural next step is to learn sparse, interpretable components within each visual stream and to assess alignment along these axes. By combining SRM-like componentization with sparsity principles from SPCA/NMF and embedding them in an alignment framework that refines RSA/CKA, the new approach isolates pathway-specific components and quantifies how DNNs align with those components, resolving the mismatch between global alignment and functional specialization.",

Yet, deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on a single task model the entire visual system surprisingly well, hinting at common computational principles across these pathways. To explore this inconsistency, we applied a novel sparse decomposition approach to identify the dominant components of visual representations within each stream. Consistent with traditional neuroscience research, we find a clear difference in component response profiles across the three visual streams\u2014identifying components selective for faces, places, bodies, text, and food in the ventral stream; social interactions, implied motion, and hand actions in the lateral stream; and some less interpretable components in the dorsal stream. Building on this, we introduce Sparse Component Alignment (SCA), a new method for measuring representational alignment between brains and machines that better capt",
