  "synthesis_narrative": "A seminal advance established that contrastive learning over web image\u2013text pairs could produce highly transferable vision models, but it left the underlying data curation opaque. Public efforts then scaled open web pretraining by filtering pairs with CLIP similarity and auxiliary predictors, making CLIP-score gating the de facto recipe for assembling massive datasets. In parallel, a benchmark reframed progress around data quality, standardizing the practice of fixing the model and training to evaluate curation alone and offering Common Crawl\u2013based pools to make data choices directly comparable. Independently of CLIP-score filtering, web-curated datasets demonstrated that effective, scalable alt-text collection is possible via metadata heuristics on Common Crawl, and that emphasizing long-tail concepts can expand coverage. Another line showed that shaping dataset composition through human-interpretable metadata\u2014such as topical communities\u2014can improve supervision quality. Finally, a multilingual Wikipedia dataset highlighted that page-level metadata fields (titles, captions, context) are rich signals for pairing without model-dependent filters. Together, these works revealed two gaps: heavy reliance on model-in-the-loop filtering that hinders reproducibility and an underexploited opportunity to steer distributions using interpretable metadata. The current work synthesizes these insights by constructing a concept vocabulary aligned with CLIP\u2019s evaluation space, mining Common Crawl with metadata heuristics, and enforcing balanced sampling over that concept distribution, all within a fixed model/training protocol to prove that a transparent, metadata-driven pipeline can recover\u2014and improve upon\u2014the benefits previously attributed to opaque CLIP data.",

    "abstract": "Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) is an approach that has advanced research and applications in computer vision, fueling modern recognition systems and generative models. We believe that the main ingredient to the success of CLIP is its \\textit{data} and \\textit{not} the \\textit{model} architecture or pre-training {objective}. However, CLIP only provides very limited information about its data and how it has been collected, leading to works that aim to reproduce CLIP's data by filtering with its model parameters. In this work, we intend to reveal CLIP's data curation approach and in our pursuit of making it open to the community introduce Metadata-Curated Language-Image Pre-training (MetaCLIP). MetaCLIP takes a raw data pool and metadata (derived from CLIP's concepts) and yields a balanced subset over the metadata distribution. Our experimental study rigorously isolates the model and training settings, concentrating solely on data. MetaCLIP applied to CommonCrawl with 400M",
