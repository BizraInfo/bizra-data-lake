  "synthesis_narrative": "ElliCE\u2019s core contribution\u2014provably robust algorithmic recourse across the Rashomon set\u2014sits at the confluence of counterfactual recourse, model multiplicity, and robust optimization. Foundational works on counterfactual explanations and actionable recourse (Wachter et al.; Ustun et al.) established counterfactuals as optimization problems with costs and feasibility constraints, but they target a single fitted model. Subsequent evidence of predictive multiplicity (Marx, Calmon, Ustun) exposed a key vulnerability: actions valid for one near-optimal model can fail under another, motivating robustness to an entire set of plausible models rather than to local perturbations alone.\nThe Rashomon set literature (Fisher, Rudin, Dominici) formalized this set-of-good-models perspective and studied feature importance across it. ElliCE translates this conceptual lens into an operational tool by proposing an ellipsoidal approximation of the Rashomon set around an empirical risk minimizer, enabling optimization of counterfactuals that are guaranteed valid throughout the set. This move is technically grounded in robust optimization with ellipsoidal uncertainty (Ben-Tal, Nemirovski), which provides convex, tractable robust counterparts and natural certificates. Moreover, the equivalence between robustness to parameter perturbations and quadratic regularization (Xu, Caramanis, Mannor) underpins ElliCE\u2019s guarantees on uniqueness and stability via strong convexity of the ellipsoidal level sets.\nRelative to prior robust recourse (e.g., ROAR), which focuses on robustness to input noise or local perturbations, ElliCE explicitly targets model uncertainty induced by multiplicity, offering theoretical guarantees on validity, uniqueness, and alignment with salient feature directions across the Rashomon set.",
