  "synthesis_narrative": "URI\u2019s core contribution\u2014learning executable decision policies from tutorial books via Understanding, Rehearsing, and Introspecting\u2014results from fusing three seminal threads: LLM agents that plan and act, model-based rehearsal, and sequence-modeling policies. On the language-action side, ReAct operationalizes interleaved reasoning and acting, offering a practical template for turning book-derived procedures into stepwise decisions. SayCan adds grounding, clarifying how high-level textual steps can be mapped to feasible action spaces through affordance/value signals, making the Understanding stage actionable.\nThe second thread is rehearsal through imagined experience. Dyna established the principle of planning with synthetic rollouts, and Imagination-Augmented Agents showed how imagined trajectories can shape policies. URI adapts this to the text era: the \u201cmodel\u201d is an LLM distilled from books, and rehearsal generates synthetic decision trajectories without environment wear.\nThe third thread turns trajectories into policies. Decision Transformer proved that high-quality trajectories alone can train competitive policies via sequence modeling, enabling URI to bypass extensive online RL and directly fit a policy network on LLM-rehearsed data. Finally, iterative improvement is powered by self-critique: Reflexion\u2019s reflection loop inspires URI\u2019s Introspecting stage to diagnose errors, refine knowledge, and regenerate better trajectories. Complementing this, Self-Instruct\u2019s paradigm of bootstrapping datasets from text motivates URI\u2019s automatic expansion of diverse practice trajectories from tutorials. Together, these works crystallize a pipeline that reads, practices, and self-improves\u2014learning policies from books with minimal real interaction.",
