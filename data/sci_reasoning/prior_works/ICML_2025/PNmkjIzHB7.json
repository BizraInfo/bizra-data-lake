  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014recasting conformal prediction as a Bayesian quadrature problem and proposing a practical Bayesian alternative\u2014sits at the junction of two lines of work: distribution-free predictive inference and probabilistic numerics for integration. The conformal framework of Vovk, Gammerman, and Shafer (2005) established exchangeability-based, frequentist guarantees and the calibration mechanisms that modern methods exploit. Practical procedures such as split conformal (Lei et al., 2018) and Jackknife+ (Barber et al., 2021) operationalized these ideas for black-box models, but their guarantees focus on marginal coverage or risk bounds without a posterior characterization of loss, often yielding conservative intervals. This paper targets precisely that limitation by reframing the conformal calibration step as sampling a loss (or nonconformity) function over the data distribution and then performing inference on its expected value at deployment.\n\nOn the Bayesian side, O\u2019Hagan\u2019s seminal Bayes-Hermite quadrature (1991) introduced GP-based posteriors over integrals, later expanded into practical algorithms and active sampling strategies by Osborne and colleagues (2012). The theoretical maturation of probabilistic integration (Briol et al., 2019) provides error quantification and guarantees that translate naturally into interpretable statements about test-time loss. Underpinning these developments is the GP machinery of Rasmussen and Williams (2006), enabling expressive priors over loss functions and tractable posterior computations. Together, these works directly enable the paper\u2019s central insight: replace conformal\u2019s frequentist coverage of outcomes with a Bayesian posterior over expected loss via quadrature, yielding richer, deployment-relevant uncertainty guarantees.",
