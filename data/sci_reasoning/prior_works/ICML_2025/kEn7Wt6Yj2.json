  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core idea\u2014using differential privacy as a principled way to hide internal randomness so that sketches can answer many adaptive queries\u2014rests on two pillars: the privacy framework and the adaptivity-robustness gap in sketching. Foundationally, Dwork et al. (2006) introduced differential privacy, establishing the sensitivity-based noise calibration that enables hiding internal randomness, while Dwork et al. (2010) provided advanced composition, quantitatively explaining the \u02dcO(\u221aT) overhead for T adaptive queries that prior works exploited for numerical answers. The reusable holdout (Dwork et al., 2015) supplied the conceptual template that privacy can preserve validity under adaptivity, directly inspiring the strategy adopted here. On the sketching side, Hardt et al. (2013) exposed that linear sketches are brittle to adaptively chosen inputs, and Ben-Eliezer et al. (2020) formalized the adversarially robust streaming model, collectively identifying the key gap: non-private sketches fail under adaptivity. This paper closes that gap for search tasks, not just numerical estimates. The specific search targets are grounded in classical formulations: Andoni and Indyk (2006) for approximate nearest neighbor and Woodruff (2014) for turnstile regression via sketching. Prior privacy-based robustness results largely returned only numerical costs; this work extends the privacy-as-randomness-hiding paradigm to produce actual solutions to search problems (e.g., nearest neighbors, regression coefficients) while tolerating many adaptive queries, thus advancing from numerical estimation to full search outputs under adaptivity.",
