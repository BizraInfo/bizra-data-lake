  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution is a structural reduction: public\u2013private distribution learning under pure DP is essentially equivalent to having a small list (or a compression) derived from public data, followed by a differentially private selection using the private sample. Three lines of prior work directly scaffold this blueprint. First, the DP learning foundations (Kasiviswanathan et al.) and the pure-vs-approximate DP distinctions (Beimel\u2013Nissim\u2013Stemmer) motivate working in the pure-DP regime and clarify why additional structure is needed for efficiency. Second, the sample compression paradigm (Moran\u2013Yehudayoff) and the combinatorial approach to density estimation (Devroye\u2013Lugosi) supply the structural handles: if a distribution class admits succinct compressions (or has a favorable Yatracos-type combinatorial profile), one can produce a small candidate set capturing the target distribution. Third, list-style intermediates from robust/list-decodable estimation (Charikar\u2013Steinhardt\u2013Valiant) show how to algorithmically obtain short lists that, with high probability, contain a near-accurate hypothesis.\nThe final link is provided by the exponential mechanism (McSherry\u2013Talwar), which privately selects a near-best element from the candidate list using only the private data. This synthesis yields a clean characterization of public\u2013private learnability via compression/list learning and explains closure properties. It also recovers and extends results for Gaussians and k-mixtures: prior structural insights on mixture learnability (Ashtiani\u2013Ben-David\u2013Harvey) translate, through the compression/list lens, into new pure-DP public\u2013private sample complexity bounds, including agnostic and distribution-shift\u2013resilient settings.",
