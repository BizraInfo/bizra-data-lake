  "synthesis_narrative": "Diffusion Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge introduced a practical SB framework for distribution matching using Euclidean Brownian reference dynamics and score estimation, concretizing how one can learn paths between prescribed marginals in continuous spaces. Earlier, Chen, Georgiou, and Pavon derived closed-form linear\u2013Gaussian bridges, showing that when the reference dynamics are linear with additive noise, one can compute time-marginals and drifts via covariance-steering Riccati equations. Independently, topological signal processing established that data on networks naturally live as cochains over simplicial complexes, and that their intrinsic diffusion is governed by Hodge Laplacians; Schaub and collaborators formalized topology-aware random walks and heat flow on edges and higher-order simplices through the normalized Hodge Laplacian, while Barbarossa and colleagues systematized cochain spaces and the topological heat equation. On discrete structures, Erbar and coauthors developed entropic interpolations (Schr\u00f6dinger bridges) on finite Markov chains, clarifying how SB extends to graphs but essentially at the node (state) level. Albergo and collaborators framed stochastic interpolants that unify flows and diffusions via bridge-based drifts, highlighting a flexible path-space matching viewpoint.\nTogether these works exposed two opportunities: SB methods excel at path-space distribution matching but assumed Euclidean or node-level dynamics, whereas topology-aware diffusion naturally models signals and flows on simplicial complexes. The present paper fuses these threads by instantiating the SB reference dynamics with Hodge-Laplacian topological heat flow on cochains and then extending the linear\u2013Gaussian bridge machinery to this operator, yielding closed-form topological Gaussian bridges (time-marginals and SDE) and a principled formulation for matching distributions on topological domains.",

    "abstract": "Given two boundary distributions, the \\emph{Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge} (SB) problem seeks the \u201cmost likely\u201d random evolution between them with respect to a reference process. It has revealed rich connections to recent machine learning methods for generative modeling and distribution matching. While these methods perform well in Euclidean domains, they are not directly applicable to topological domains such as graphs and simplicial complexes, which are crucial for data defined over network entities, such as node signals and edge flows. In this work, we propose the \\emph{Topological Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge problem} ($\\mathcal{T}$SBP) for matching signal distributions on a topological domain. We set the reference process to follow some linear tractable \\emph{topology-aware} stochastic dynamics such as topological heat diffusion. For the case of Gaussian boundary distributions, we derive a \\emph{closed-form} topological SB ($\\mathcal{T}$SB) in terms of its time-marginal and stochastic differential. In",
