  "synthesis_narrative": "Discrete Spatial Diffusion (DSD) reframes diffusion generative modeling by making the forward corruption a conservative, continuous-time Markov jump process that exchanges unit mass between neighboring sites, thereby preserving global particle counts. The overall generative recipe follows DDPM and the score-SDE line of work: define a simple-to-sample forward process and learn its reverse-time dynamics for sampling. Song et al.\u2019s continuous-time perspective is crucial, as DSD works in continuous time but with discrete states, translating reverse-time SDE ideas to CTMCs. Prior discrete diffusion models\u2014Austin et al.\u2019s structured discrete diffusion and Hoogeboom et al.\u2019s multinomial diffusion\u2014provide practical parameterizations and training losses for discrete state spaces; however, they corrupt sites independently and do not enforce conservation. DSD departs by encoding noise as spatial hops, which inherently conserve the total count.\nThe construction of a valid reverse process for jump dynamics depends on classical CTMC time-reversal theory (as in Norris), which supplies the form of reverse rates in terms of forward generators and time-marginals. The choice of a conservative forward operator is grounded in the interacting particle systems literature (Liggett), specifically Kawasaki-type exchange dynamics that maintain conserved quantities by local swaps. Together, these strands yield a diffusion framework that is discrete, spatial, and exactly intensity-preserving, enabling generative modeling for domains where conservation laws (e.g., mass or particle number) are non-negotiable.",
