  "synthesis_narrative": "MusIK sits squarely in the line of work on rich-observation reinforcement learning formalized by contextual decision processes and, more concretely, Block MDPs. Jiang et al. (2017) provided the foundational CDP learnability perspective, while Sun et al. (2019) developed model-based methods and the policy-cover paradigm for exploration with rich observations. In the same period, the latent-state decoding approach crystallized the Block MDP formulation and its promise, but left open how to achieve both computational efficiency and optimal sample complexity with minimal assumptions. Reward-free exploration (Jin et al., 2020) further clarified the explore-then-commit template that MusIK follows: first collect coverage, then exploit learned structure.\nA key proximate influence is PCID, which introduced one-step inverse dynamics as a practical representation-learning tool to construct a policy cover in Block MDPs. However, PCID\u2019s one-step criterion can fail to identify latent structure and may yield suboptimal sample dependence. MusIK\u2019s central innovation\u2014multi-step inverse kinematics\u2014directly extends this idea by conditioning on possibly distant future observations, overcoming identifiability failures and enabling rate-optimal sample complexity with efficient learning. In parallel, VALOR demonstrated that optimal rates are statistically achievable but at the cost of heavy oracle assumptions and computational burdens; MusIK closes this gap by achieving both efficiency and optimality. Finally, MusIK\u2019s learning objective is inspired by inverse-dynamics self-supervision popularized by Pathak et al. (2017), but is upgraded to a multi-step formulation with rigorous guarantees tailored to Block MDPs.",
