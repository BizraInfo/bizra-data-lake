  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014sequentially bridging irregular longitudinal gaps with a conditional diffusion model guided by time-dependent ordinal factors\u2014rests on two intertwined lines of work. First, DDPM and the SDE-based score-modeling framework laid the generative foundation: DDPM provides the denoising objective and noise schedule, while the SDE view enables principled conditioning across continuous time, which is essential for synthesis over irregular visit intervals. Building on that foundation, CSDI supplied the closest methodological precursor by showing how conditional score-based diffusion can impute time series given partial observations. The present work extends this paradigm from pointwise imputation to explicit longitudinal bridging across long gaps and, critically, augments the conditioning mechanism to respect ordered clinical covariates via an ordinal-regression objective. The need for such an approach is underscored by limitations in prior longitudinal generators: GAN-based TimeGAN struggles with stability and long-horizon fidelity, and continuous-time Latent ODEs often oversmooth and fail to capture multi-modal progression over large intervals. On the clinical side, SuStaIn\u2019s staging perspective established disease severity as an inherently ordinal construct in neurodegeneration, directly motivating ordered conditioning. CORAL then provides the rank-consistent ordinal regression machinery that the authors repurpose to steer the diffusion trajectory with multiple time-varying ordinal factors (e.g., age and severity). Together, these works directly shape the paper\u2019s design: a diffusion-based, ordinally guided bridge for realistic neurodegenerative disease progression synthesis.",
