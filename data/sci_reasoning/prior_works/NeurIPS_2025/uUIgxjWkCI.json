  "synthesis_narrative": "WaveCanCoh sits at the intersection of canonical spectral analysis and multiscale nonstationary modeling. In the stationary regime, Brillinger and Hannan laid the mathematical foundations for canonical coherence\u2014frequency-domain canonical correlation between vector time series\u2014defining the population objects WaveCanCoh ultimately seeks to recover over time and across scales. Priestley\u2019s evolutionary spectrum reframed dependence as time-varying, motivating coherence measures that adapt to changing dynamics. Dahlhaus advanced this by formalizing locally stationary processes and consistent estimation of time-varying spectral matrices, establishing a principled route to evolve canonical objects in time.\nThe wavelet line of work supplies the multiscale machinery essential for transient, frequency-specific interactions. Nason, von Sachs, and Kroisandt\u2019s locally stationary wavelet (LSW) model enables time\u2013scale localized second-order structure, which WaveCanCoh leverages to define scale-specific canonical coherence between signal clusters. Grinsted, Moore, and Jevrejeva\u2019s wavelet coherence provided a practical, time\u2013frequency localized dependence measure\u2014but only pairwise\u2014highlighting the need for a multivariate, cluster-based generalization. Finally, Ombao and co-authors\u2019 SLEX framework demonstrated how to estimate time-varying spectral matrices and coherence for nonstationary vectors, bridging theory and computation for evolving connectivity.\nIntegrating these streams, WaveCanCoh generalizes stationary canonical coherence to nonstationary multivariate clusters by embedding it within the LSW framework. This yields interpretable, scale-specific, time-evolving canonical coherences and estimation procedures grounded in established theory for locally stationary processes and time\u2013frequency spectral matrices.",
