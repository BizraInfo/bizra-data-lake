  "synthesis_narrative": "The core advance of Multitask Learning with Stochastic Interpolants is to replace the scalar time in generative dynamics with vector-, matrix-, or operator-valued controls, yielding a family of operator-based interpolants that can bridge distributions across different spaces and tasks within a single model. This leap is built directly on the stochastic interpolants framework (Albergo et al., 2023), which unified diffusion and flow models under a scalar interpolation parameter. Foundational diffusion works\u2014DDPM (Ho et al., 2020) and score-based SDEs (Song et al., 2021)\u2014established denoising/score objectives and continuous-time dynamics; the new operator formulation recovers these as special cases when the control reduces to a scalar schedule. On the flow side, continuous-time normalizing flows such as FFJORD (Grathwohl et al., 2019) framed generation as ODE transport; operator-based interpolants encompass such deterministic transports while allowing controlled, multi-dimensional interpolation.\n\nCrucially, recent zero-shot conditioning and inverse-problem methods demonstrated that linear operators can steer pre-trained diffusion models without retraining. DDRM (Kawar et al., 2022) and DPS (Chung et al., 2022) explicitly embed measurement/mask operators into sampling to perform restoration and posterior inference, and RePaint (Lugmayr et al., 2022) uses masking for inpainting. The present work abstracts and unifies these operator-guided techniques: instead of ad hoc guidance rules, it treats the operator itself as the interpolation \u201ctime,\u201d enabling conditional generation, inpainting, posterior sampling, and multiscale modeling within one principled framework. Thus, the paper synthesizes the unifying theory of stochastic interpolants with diffusion/flow dynamics and operator-guided zero-shot methods to deliver a task-agnostic, multitask generative model.",
