  "synthesis_narrative": "EvoRate\u2019s central idea\u2014to quantify the intensity of evolving patterns in sequential data via mutual information\u2014sits at the intersection of classic information-theoretic views of time series structure and modern, scalable MI estimation. Early time-series work by Fraser and Swinney established auto mutual information as a powerful nonlinear dependence measure between temporally lagged observations, foreshadowing EvoRate\u2019s use of MI across time to assess how much predictive signal exists. Schreiber\u2019s transfer entropy introduced directionality, demonstrating that information-theoretic measures can adjudicate temporal order and justify the use of sequential models.\nBuilding on this, Bialek, Nemenman, and Tishby\u2019s predictive information, together with computational mechanics from Shalizi and Crutchfield, formalized past\u2013future mutual information as the essence of learnable structure (excess entropy). EvoRate operationalizes these theoretical constructs into a practical metric that maps directly to the strength of exploitable temporal regularity, thereby informing when sequential models are warranted, how to select features, and even how to orient time in data.\nRealizing this vision at scale relies on neural MI estimators. MINE provides a general variational framework to estimate MI in high-dimensional settings, while CPC\u2019s InfoNCE bound offers a stable, sequence-aware objective tailored to temporal prediction. Finally, analyses by Poole et al. warn of estimator-specific biases and variance, guiding EvoRate\u2019s estimator choice and any corrections needed for reliable deployment on real temporal datasets. Together, these works supply EvoRate\u2019s conceptual foundation, directional sensitivity, and practical estimation toolkit.",
