  "synthesis_narrative": "DoRA\u2019s core innovation\u2014separating a pre-trained weight into magnitude and direction and applying low-rank updates only to the direction\u2014sits at the intersection of two lines of work. First, Weight Normalization (Salimans & Kingma) provided the crucial reparameterization that decouples a weight into scale and a unit vector; DoRA directly adopts this decomposition as its modeling scaffold. Second, LoRA (Hu et al.) established low-rank adaptation as a practical, inference-free PEFT baseline for large models. However, LoRA\u2019s single-path update implicitly entangles magnitude and direction and can lag behind full fine-tuning. DoRA preserves LoRA\u2019s efficiency but assigns the low-rank pathway to directional updates while learning magnitude separately, thereby targeting the identified capacity/stability gap.\nThe broader PEFT literature motivated DoRA\u2019s design constraints. Adapters (Houlsby et al.) defined the PEFT problem but incur runtime overhead, clarifying the need for a scheme with LoRA-like inference parity. BitFit demonstrated that judiciously chosen, very small parameter sets can be surprisingly effective, supporting DoRA\u2019s light-weight magnitude parameterization. Finally, QLoRA (Dettmers et al.) exemplifies the community\u2019s drive for efficient, deployment-friendly finetuning; DoRA offers a complementary improvement that can be layered with such efficiency techniques by enhancing learning capacity without adding inference costs. Together, these works directly shaped DoRA\u2019s decomposition-based parameterization and its focus on matching full fine-tuning behavior under PEFT constraints.",
