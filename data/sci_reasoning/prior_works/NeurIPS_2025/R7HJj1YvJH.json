  "synthesis_narrative": "Quantile-Guided Alignment (QA) emerges by fusing the RLHF pipeline for language models with distributional and risk-sensitive reinforcement learning. Foundationally, RLHF established how to learn reward models from preferences and optimize policies accordingly (Christiano et al., 2017), later refined for language modeling with KL-regularized policy optimization in summarization (Stiennon et al., 2020) and scaled to instruction following (Ouyang et al., 2022). However, these methods predominantly optimize expected reward, leaving rare but harmful tail outcomes under-controlled.\nDistributional RL reframed returns as distributions rather than expectations (Bellemare et al., 2017), while QR-DQN provided a practical quantile-regression parameterization of those distributions (Dabney et al., 2018). QA directly leverages these insights by targeting specific reward quantiles, allowing users to request improvements at the tails and across multiple reward dimensions. In parallel, risk-sensitive RL formalized tail-aware objectives like CVaR and provided gradient-based techniques to optimize them (Tamar et al., 2015), motivating QA\u2019s focus on the lower tail of the reward distribution to mitigate catastrophic outputs.\nOperationally, QA\u2019s \u201caugmented reward with quantile constraints\u201d is closely related to constrained RL formulations, where Lagrangian or trust-region methods enforce safety or performance limits during optimization (Achiam et al., 2017). By integrating quantile-aware objectives from distributional/risk-sensitive RL into the established RLHF pipeline for LLMs, QA offers a principled mechanism to calibrate tail risk\u2014improving worst-case quality while maintaining overall performance.",
