  "synthesis_narrative": "The core contribution of this paper\u2014establishing a theoretical framework for gradient-based training on AIMC under general asymmetric, nonlinear response functions and proposing a residual learning algorithm with exact convergence\u2014sits at the intersection of two lines of prior work. On the hardware/algorithmic side, Gokmen and Vlasov (2016) formulated analog SGD in resistive crossbars and pinpointed device non-idealities\u2014particularly asymmetric, nonlinear update responses\u2014as a fundamental obstacle. Ambrogio et al. (2018) validated these effects experimentally in PCM-based training and introduced practical mitigation, while Gokmen and Haensch\u2019s Tiki-Taka (2019) proposed a tailored algorithm to compensate asymmetry within analog arrays. These works establish the phenomena and heuristic solutions but leave a general theoretical account of training dynamics under arbitrary response functions open.\nConcurrently, the optimization literature developed principled tools for handling biased gradient updates through residual (error-feedback) mechanisms. Seide et al. (2014) operationalized residuals for 1-bit SGD; Stich et al. (2018) provided theory for memory-based correction under sparsification; and Karimireddy et al. (2019) showed error feedback restores convergence for a broad class of biased compressors. The present paper extends this logic to the analog domain: it proves that asymmetric response functions impose a specific implicit penalty on the objective, degrading Analog SGD, and then designs a residual learning algorithm that accumulates and injects hardware-induced update errors to cancel the bias. By unifying device-level response modeling with error-feedback theory, the paper delivers general convergence guarantees and a practically motivated training method for AIMC with non-ideal resistive elements.",
