  "synthesis_narrative": "Karchmer\u2019s work sits squarely on the theoretical footing laid by Lu\u2019s NeurIPS\u201923 framework for multimodal learning, which formalized what it means to compare multimodal and unimodal learners and to speak of separations between them. Building on this, Lu\u2019s ALT\u201924 paper delivered the first explicit computational separation but only in the worst-case setting, leaving open whether the observed empirical superiority of multimodal systems could be theoretically justified on typical instances. Karchmer directly addresses this gap by establishing an average-case computational separation in the very model that Lu introduced, thereby strengthening the core claim and aligning it more closely with practice. \nBeyond proving the stronger separation, the paper interrogates its naturalness by revealing a cryptographic consequence: under mild conditions, any such average-case separation yields a key agreement protocol. This interpretive step draws from the classic information-theoretic lineage of secret key agreement from correlated sources\u2014Maurer and Ahlswede\u2013Csisz\u00e1r\u2014because the multimodal setup naturally endows two parties with correlated views that jointly reveal more than either view alone. The average-case perspective is essential here, and the reasoning leans on Levin\u2019s formal toolkit for average-case hardness. Finally, to move from a shared but computationally hidden joint value to usable cryptographic keys, the paper\u2019s logic resonates with Goldreich\u2013Levin\u2019s hard-core predicate paradigm, which enables extracting secure bits from computational hardness. Together, these works directly scaffold Karchmer\u2019s stronger separation and its cryptographic implications.",
