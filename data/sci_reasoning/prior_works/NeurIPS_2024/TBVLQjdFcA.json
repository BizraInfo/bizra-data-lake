  "synthesis_narrative": "GPCPR advances few-shot 3D point cloud segmentation by directly addressing two root causes of poor prototype quality: limited semantic coverage in scarce 3D supports and support\u2013query class-bias. Its design is grounded in metric-based few-shot learning, where Matching Networks and Prototypical Networks established episodic training and class prototypes as the operative representation for support\u2013query matching. The early segmentation adaptation by One-Shot Semantic Segmentation transferred this paradigm to dense labeling, laying the groundwork on which GPCPR operates in the 3D domain.\nTo combat support sparsity, GPCPR imports language-derived semantic priors. CLIP demonstrated that natural language descriptions encode transferable class semantics; CoOp further showed that the choice and diversity of prompts materially impact performance. GPCPR\u2019s GCPR module operationalizes these insights by using LLMs to generate diverse, differentiated class descriptions and fusing them to enrich class prototypes\u2014effectively expanding semantic context without additional 3D annotation.\nTo mitigate support\u2013query bias, GPCPR turns to pseudo-labeling and self-training principles. Pseudo-Label and Noisy Student established the utility of confidence-filtered pseudo supervision and iterative refinement. GPCPR\u2019s PCPR module echoes these practices by mining reliable query regions to update prototypes, closing the domain gap between support and query. Together, language-driven enrichment and reliability-guided query refinement yield stronger, less biased prototypes, directly enabling the method\u2019s reported gains in few-shot point cloud segmentation.",
