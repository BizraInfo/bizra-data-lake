  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014achieving polynomial-regret online prediction and simulation for piecewise-affine (PWA) systems under weak smoothing\u2014combines three intellectual strands. First, the smoothed-analysis perspective (Spielman\u2013Teng) underpins the central premise: modest stochastic perturbations can convert worst-case intractability into tractable average-case behavior. Recent work formalizing smoothed online learning sharpens this lens for sequential decision-making, showing that small, exogenous noise in the adversary or inputs can restore learnability even for nonconvex or discontinuous losses. Second, the algorithmic engine draws on FTPL-style perturbation methods (Kalai\u2013Vempala) and their generalized, oracle-efficient reductions, which turn an empirical-risk minimization (ERM) oracle over complex hypothesis classes into an online learner with few oracle calls per round. This black-box ERM-to-online pipeline is essential for handling the combinatorial, nonconvex structure of PWA predictors while keeping computation practical. Third, the PWA and hybrid-systems literature (Ferrari-Trecate et al.; Paoletti et al.) defines the modeling target and highlights the challenge posed by discontinuities at region boundaries, while sequential prediction work for dynamical processes (Anava\u2013Hazan\u2013Mannor) supplies regret notions for one-step prediction and multi-step simulation that the present paper adapts to the PWA regime. Together, these ideas yield the first oracle-efficient online algorithms with polynomial regret for PWA prediction and simulation under a weak smoothing assumption, bridging a gap between hybrid-systems modeling and modern online learning theory.",
