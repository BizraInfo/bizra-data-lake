  "synthesis_narrative": "Covariate-Assisted Spectral Clustering established that incorporating node attributes by mixing covariate similarity with adjacency in a spectral objective can significantly improve community detection under contextual SBMs, highlighting the value of matching structural and attribute spectra. Complementing this, Kalofolias framed graph topology learning as finding a graph on which observed features are smooth, providing an optimization perspective for turning noisy attributes into graph-aware signals. Diffusion-based rewiring via personalized PageRank or heat kernels emerged as a strong, practical way to refine topology, albeit without leveraging node features. Bilevel graph structure learning further showed that task-driven topology inference is powerful but computationally demanding and dependent on labels. Robust GSL methods like Pro-GNN pursued joint graph recovery using low-rank and sparsity with feature smoothness priors, implicitly assuming homophily. Simple Jaccard pruning revealed that even heuristic, feature-guided edge edits can enhance learning by enforcing agreement between structure and attributes. Finally, the heterophily literature documented how smoothing-centric GNNs and many rewiring strategies falter when signal resides in higher frequencies, calling for frequency-aware alignment between features and graph. Against this backdrop, it was natural to synthesize a feature-aware, unsupervised alternative to diffusion and heavy bilevel GSL: align the leading spectral spaces of graph and feature matrices to guide both edge rewiring and feature denoising. This unifies CASC\u2019s spectral fusion with signal-driven topology ideas, while addressing heterophily by aligning spectra rather than enforcing smoothness, and yields a scalable pre-processing that subsumes heuristic pruning and improves over feature-agnostic diffusion.",

In this paper we propose an algorithm to **j**ointly **d**enoise the features and **r**ewire the graph (JDR), which improves the performance of downstream node classification graph neural nets (GNNs). JDR works by aligning the leading spectral spaces of graph and feature matrices. It approximately solves the associated non-convex optimization problem in a way that handles graphs with multiple classes and different levels of homophily or heterophily. We theoretically justify JDR in a stylized setting and show that it consistently outperforms existing rewiring methods on a wide range of synthetic and real-world node classification tasks.",
