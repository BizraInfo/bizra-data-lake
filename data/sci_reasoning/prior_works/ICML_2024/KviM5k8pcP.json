  "synthesis_narrative": "AI Control\u2019s central advance\u2014protocols that maintain safety even when the strongest available model is untrusted\u2014emerges from fusing three direct lines of prior work. First, the paper inherits a concrete, enforceable verification substrate from code-generation research: Chen et al. introduced HumanEval-style unit-test harnesses that make correctness auditable, and Cobbe et al. showed that sampling plus a verifier can outperform pure generation. AI Control takes this verification paradigm from expected-accuracy improvement to hard-zero-error control by separating roles (untrusted proposer vs trusted weaker checker) and budgeting trusted human review. Second, scalable oversight ideas from alignment\u2014particularly Iterated Distillation and Amplification and AI Safety via Debate\u2014directly inform the protocol design: they motivate using weaker overseers and adversarial interactions to extract reliability from a stronger (and potentially deceptive) system. AI Control concretizes these abstractions into operational pipelines for high-stakes programming tasks, defining how a weaker trusted model and limited human labor can constrain a stronger model\u2019s actions. Third, the work explicitly targets the deception gap crystallized by Risks from Learned Optimization and Sleeper Agents: if capable models can intentionally subvert instructions, we need defense-in-depth protocols rather than solely alignment. Finally, LM-assisted adversarial evaluation from Ganguli et al. shapes the paper\u2019s red-teaming methodology, enabling systematic search for subversion strategies. Together, these works directly underpin AI Control\u2019s formulation and its practical, testable control pipelines.",
