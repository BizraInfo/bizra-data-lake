  "synthesis_narrative": "HIQL\u2019s core idea is to make offline goal-conditioned RL work by (1) learning an action-free, goal-conditioned value function that is easier to estimate from diverse data and (2) exploiting the structure of long-horizon tasks via hierarchical subgoals selected in state/latent space. This design tightly integrates several prior threads. UVFA introduced goal-conditioned value functions, making it natural for HIQL to learn a single goal-conditioned value that can supervise multiple policies. HER demonstrated that hindsight goal relabeling can transform arbitrary trajectories into useful goal-reaching data; HIQL inherits this mechanism to obtain rich supervision, particularly for near-goal segments where value estimation is reliable.\n\nThe hierarchical decomposition in HIQL is directly inspired by HIRO and HAC, which showed that treating states (or latent states) as high-level actions and relabeling subgoals stabilizes learning; HIQL adopts this states-as-actions view to select subgoals that bridge distant targets through easier, nearby ones. From the offline RL side, IQL provides the critical recipe for robust policy learning from static datasets\u2014an action-free value with advantage-weighted updates that avoid explicit behavior modeling\u2014an approach HIQL extends to both high- and low-level goal-conditioned policies. Finally, GCSL and C-Learning shaped the problem framing for learning from unlabeled, reward-free data: GCSL exposed challenges in long-horizon credit assignment in offline goal-reaching, while C-Learning highlighted the robustness of action-agnostic success objectives. HIQL synthesizes these influences to deliver a hierarchical, offline, goal-conditioned method that learns reliable short-horizon values and composes them to reach distant goals.",
