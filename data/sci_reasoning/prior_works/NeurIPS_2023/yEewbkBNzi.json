  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation is a convergence proof for Adam that dispenses with the classical global bounded-gradient assumption by establishing boundedness of gradients along the optimization trajectory under a generalized smoothness condition, and a variance-reduced Adam variant with accelerated complexity. This builds directly on two lines of prior work.\nFirst, algorithmic and analytical foundations for Adam come from Kingma and Ba\u2019s original method and Reddi et al.\u2019s seminal analysis showing Adam\u2019s potential divergence and proposing AMSGrad. Those works crystallized both the adaptive update rules and a prevailing analytical template that relies on stringent conditions such as globally bounded gradients. The present paper targets this precise gap by replacing global boundedness with a local, gradient-dependent smoothness property and proving that Adam\u2019s iterates inherently keep gradients bounded along the path.\nSecond, the complexity targets and variance-reduction toolkit derive from nonconvex stochastic optimization and VR literature. Ghadimi and Lan\u2019s results furnish the O(\u03b5^-4) reference rate to which the new Adam analysis is compared. To accelerate, the paper adopts variance-reduction ideas rooted in SVRG and SARAH\u2019s recursive estimators, while STORM illustrates how momentum can be fused with VR\u2014informing the design of a VR-Adam that preserves Adam\u2019s adaptivity yet achieves improved sample complexity. Conceptually, Nesterov\u2019s universal-gradient viewpoint legitimizes relaxing standard Lipschitz smoothness, aligning with the paper\u2019s generalized smoothness (Hessian controlled by a sub-quadratic function of the gradient norm) that enables the key trajectory-wise bounded-gradient argument.",
