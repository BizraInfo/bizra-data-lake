  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s central advance\u2014using transformer attention to dynamically route retinotopic visual features into category-selective brain responses\u2014sits at the intersection of three lines of prior work. First, the transformer and its vision instantiation established attention as a general-purpose, content-dependent routing mechanism across tokenized spatial inputs. Attention Is All You Need provided the mathematical mechanism for learnable routing, and Vision Transformers showed how patch tokens can represent retinotopic structure while enabling global, flexible interactions. Second, the dominant brain-encoding paradigm of mapping deep network features to voxels with linear weights, crystallized by Yamins and colleagues, demonstrated that task-optimized features can predict high-level cortex but typically relied on large, voxel-wise linear parameterizations that ignore model structure. In response, feature-weighted receptive fields and classical population receptive field modeling formalized a factorized, interpretable spatial-feature mapping; however, these methods assume static receptive fields best suited to early visual areas. Third, the conceptual push toward dynamic assignment from lower to higher levels, exemplified by capsule routing, argued for input-dependent connectivity rather than fixed pooling. The present paper synthesizes these strands: it retains the predictive power of DNN features, incorporates the spatial interpretability of pRF-style mappings, and replaces static factorization with transformer attention that implements dynamic, stimulus-contingent routing. Evaluated under naturalistic conditions pioneered by Nishimoto et al., the approach explains high-level visual responses more accurately, arguing that flexible attentional routing is a key computational motif of the ventral stream.",
