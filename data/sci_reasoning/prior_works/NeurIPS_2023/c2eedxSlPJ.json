  "synthesis_narrative": "The modern understanding that unregularized gradient descent on separable data implicitly converges to the max-margin solution began with Soudry et al. (2018), which explains the centrality of the margin \u03b3 in generalization analyses. Subsequent work by Ji and Telgarsky (2018) quantified optimization dynamics for logistic regression, showing how norms and margins evolve with iterations and revealing that the loss\u2019s tail controls convergence rates. Nacson and collaborators (2019) broadened this perspective to general smooth losses, explicitly tying GD\u2019s trajectory to the tail decay of the loss, foreshadowing a unified treatment across losses.\n\nOn the generalization front, Hardt, Recht, and Singer (2016) introduced algorithmic stability techniques that have become standard for turning optimization dynamics into population risk guarantees; these methods are particularly potent when the iterates\u2019 geometry (e.g., margin growth) can be controlled. Building on these tools, Shamir (2021) and then Schliserman and Koren (2022) derived risk bounds for GD in the separable regime, but with limitations\u2014bounds tailored to specific losses (often logistic) or relying on technical assumptions.\n\nThe NeurIPS 2023 paper synthesizes these threads: it couples tail-sensitive optimization dynamics with stability-based generalization to produce tight upper and lower population risk bounds for virtually any convex, smooth loss. This is captured by a single complexity term r_{\u2113,T} reflecting the loss\u2019s tail decay, yielding bounds of order \u0398(r_{\u2113,T}^2/(\u03b3^2 T) + r_{\u2113,T}^2/(\u03b3^2 n)). The result both subsumes and sharpens prior risk analyses while matching lower bounds, establishing optimality across a broad class of losses.",
