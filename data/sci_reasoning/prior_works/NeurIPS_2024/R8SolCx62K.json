  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014uncovering representation scattering as a latent mechanism unifying node discrimination, group discrimination, and bootstrapping GCL frameworks, and then operationalizing it via a center-away strategy\u2014builds on two strands of prior work. First, foundational graph contrastive methods established the empirical success of diverse training paradigms: DGI (global\u2013local MI with corruption), InfoGraph (global\u2013substructure MI), GRACE (node-level instance discrimination with augmentations), GraphCL (graph-level contrast with augmentation design), and MVGRL (multi-view diffusion-based contrast). Although methodologically distinct, each introduced forces that disperse embeddings across views, nodes, and substructures\u2014implicitly enhancing representation diversity. Second, theoretical and non-contrastive advances clarified why such dispersion is beneficial. Wang and Isola\u2019s alignment\u2013uniformity framework formalized the need to spread representations uniformly on the hypersphere, directly motivating the paper\u2019s \u201crepresentation scattering\u201d terminology and suggesting that explicitly pushing embeddings away from centers should help. BYOL further showed that collapse can be averted without negatives by preserving variance, offering a complementary perspective on how dispersion-like effects arise in bootstrapping schemes. By synthesizing these insights, the paper argues that a common scattering principle underlies comparable performance across GCL variants, and it designs SGRL to directly manipulate this factor through a center-away objective that amplifies diversity while preserving alignment\u2014yielding a unified, mechanism-driven improvement over prior GCL recipes.",
