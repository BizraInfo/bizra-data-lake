  "synthesis_narrative": "Hummingbird\u2019s core contribution\u2014performing dense scene understanding in an in-context manner via nearest-neighbor retrieval from a prompt of annotated features\u2014arises from the confluence of three lines of work. First, the conceptual shift of in-context learning from NLP (Brown et al.) motivates configuring behavior at inference without finetuning. Operationalizing this non-parametrically is inspired by kNN-LM, which augments a model with a retrieval layer keyed by internal representations; Hummingbird repurposes this as pixel-level kNN over prompted annotations to emit labels for segmentation, depth, and more.\nSecond, decades of matching-based dense prediction directly inform the mechanism. In video object segmentation, STM demonstrates memory-based label propagation via pixel affinity to annotated frames, while few-shot segmentation methods like PANet label query pixels by similarity to support prototypes. Hummingbird abstracts this retrieval-based labeling beyond specific tasks or temporal continuity, treating any annotated exemplars as a prompt.\nThird, the model\u2019s new pretraining protocol leverages advances in representation learning for correspondences. DenseCL\u2019s pixel-wise alignment across views and LoFTR\u2019s cross-image transformer attention both show that cross-image interactions yield matchable features. Building on ViT\u2019s token attention, Hummingbird explicitly trains with within- and across-image attention to produce per-pixel embeddings optimized for cross-image kNN transfer. Together, these strands enable a universal, promptable vision model that approaches specialist performance on dense tasks without task-specific heads or finetuning.",
