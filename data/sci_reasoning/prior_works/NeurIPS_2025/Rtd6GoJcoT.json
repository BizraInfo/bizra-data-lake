  "synthesis_narrative": "Orochi\u2019s core contribution\u2014a single, application-oriented biomedical image processor pretrained with task-related joint-embedding\u2014emerges at the intersection of self-supervised learning, medical-domain SSL, and general-purpose image restoration. From MAE, the authors inherit the scale and appeal of pretraining but deliberately move away from masked image modeling, arguing that its pretext is not aligned with biomedical low-level tasks. Instead, they adopt a joint-embedding framework in the spirit of BYOL, replacing generic augmentations with domain-relevant degradations (blur, noise, downsampling, misalignment), thereby making the pretext task explicitly predictive of downstream restoration, registration, fusion, and super-resolution.\nModels Genesis provides the medical-imaging precedent for large-scale, unlabeled pretraining\u2014especially on 3D volumes\u2014while Orochi scales this idea across 100+ studies and couples it with random multi-scale sampling to cover heterogeneous resolutions and modalities. The corruption-to-reconstruction logic of Noise2Void directly motivates using degradations as self-supervision signals; BSRGAN further shapes Orochi\u2019s degradation design for super-resolution by emphasizing realistic, diverse degradation pipelines that transfer to real data. For registration, VoxelMorph\u2019s unsupervised formulation underlines that alignment can be learned without ground truth, informing Orochi\u2019s misalignment/deformation degradations within TJP. Finally, Restormer evidences that a single efficient backbone can unify multiple low-level tasks, which Orochi adapts to the biomedical domain through specialized pretraining and volume/patch handling. Together, these works crystallize into Orochi\u2019s TJP and multi-scale data strategy, yielding a versatile, efficient processor tailored to biologists\u2019 practical needs.",
