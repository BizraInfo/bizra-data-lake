  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core idea is to maintain a constant-approximate, low-recourse facility location solution by reducing all per-update work to a small number of dynamic nearest-neighbor (NN) operations in high-dimensional Euclidean space. The dynamic decision logic draws directly from the online facility location literature: Meyerson\u2019s threshold-based opening rule provides the incremental structure for handling insertions with bounded recourse, while Fotakis\u2019s competitive online algorithms reinforce how to stabilize facility openings/assignments even as the instance evolves. To achieve constant-factor guarantees in a form amenable to dynamic maintenance, the authors extend the greedy/dual-fitting blueprint of Jain\u2013Mahdian\u2013Saberi (JMS), dynamically maintaining the potentials/charges that underlie JMS\u2019s constant approximation and updating them via nearest-neighbor distances. The technical enabler for sublinear update time in high dimensions is a plug-in dynamic ANN oracle: Locality-sensitive hashing by Datar et al. supplies the foundational tool for fast NN in \u21132 with updates, and refined hashing schemes by Andoni\u2013Indyk and by Andoni\u2013Razenshteyn yield stronger time bounds that translate directly into the paper\u2019s \u00d5(poly(d)\u00b7n^{1/c+o(1)}) amortized update guarantees. In sum, the work fuses JMS-style greedy dual fitting with online UFL stability insights and modern high-dimensional ANN oracles, thereby overcoming the known obstacles for dynamic UFL in general metrics and establishing the first fully dynamic algorithm with sublinear update time in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces.",
