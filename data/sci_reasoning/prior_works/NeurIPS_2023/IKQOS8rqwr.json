  "synthesis_narrative": "QuACK\u2019s key contribution\u2014accelerating gradient-based quantum optimization by learning a linear predictor of natural-gradient dynamics\u2014emerges from a confluence of information geometry, variational quantum dynamics, and Koopman operator learning. On the optimization side, Amari\u2019s natural gradient established the geometric view of learning, which, in the quantum setting, was specialized by Stokes et al. to define quantum natural gradient updates via the Fubini\u2013Study/quantum Fisher metric. Closely related, the TDVP-based theory of variational quantum simulation (Yuan et al.) casts parameter evolution as a metric-weighted dynamical system, providing the exact flow QuACK aims to propagate efficiently. The computational motivation is framed by parameter-shift\u2013based gradient evaluation (Schuld et al.), whose linear scaling with parameter count creates the bottleneck QuACK seeks to break.\nOn the dynamical-systems side, EDMD (Williams et al.) supplies the core algorithmic recipe for approximating the Koopman operator from data, enabling linear prediction of inherently nonlinear dynamics. Korda and Mezi\u0107 extend this to settings with inputs/control, directly inspiring QuACK\u2019s alternating \u2018controlled\u2019 Koopman learning to handle parameterized updates over optimization steps. Finally, deep Koopman learning (Lusch et al.) shows that expressive learned liftings can stabilize and enhance Koopman models; QuACK mirrors this principle by leveraging learned (quantum) feature maps and an alternating training scheme. Together, these works crystallize into QuACK\u2019s bridge: a controlled Koopman learner that linearly forecasts natural-gradient dynamics, dramatically reducing gradient queries while preserving metric-aware optimization behavior across diverse quantum applications.",
