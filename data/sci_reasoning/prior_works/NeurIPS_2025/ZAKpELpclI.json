  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014a constructive, low-complexity family of neural compressors that are provably optimal for the rate\u2013distortion\u2013perception (RDP) tradeoff\u2014sits at the intersection of three lines of prior work. First, classical rate\u2013distortion theory (Shannon, 1959) frames optimal compression as efficient space packing, a perspective that naturally connects to vector and lattice quantization. Blau and Michaeli\u2019s perception\u2013distortion formulation (2018) then introduces a distribution-level constraint, reframing lossy compression as a tripartite R\u2013D\u2013P optimization problem. Second, the necessity and role of shared randomness to induce target joint distributions is grounded in coordination theory (Cuff\u2013Permuter\u2013Cover, 2010), foreshadowing that perceptual constraints may require encoder\u2013decoder common randomness beyond deterministic encoders. Third, dithered lattice quantization provides precisely the constructive tool to combine packing efficiency with shared randomness. Schuchman (1964) established subtractive dither\u2019s independence properties, while Zamir and Feder (1992, 1996) showed that dithered lattice quantizers are universal and that good lattices yield near-ideal noise, delivering low-complexity RD-optimal behavior. Finally, modern neural compression frameworks (Ball\u00e9 et al., 2017) furnish the differentiable training scaffold into which these lattice and dither primitives can be embedded. Synthesizing these strands, the paper replaces generic quantizers with shared-dithered lattice modules inside learned compressors, and analyzes their RDP performance\u2014proving optimality with infinite shared randomness and matching limits without it\u2014thereby transforming abstract RDP limits into practical, optimal neural constructions.",
