  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core idea\u2014recasting watermark detection as a general goodness-of-fit (GoF) problem\u2014builds directly on the original watermark framework of Kirchenbauer et al., which relies on an i.i.d. pivotal statistic (a z-test over greenlist indicators) under human-written text. By recognizing that such pivotal constructions naturally yield multinomial or empirical distribution function testing problems, the authors draw from the GoF canon: Cressie\u2013Read\u2019s power-divergence family provides a unified, multinomial test bed (including Pearson\u2019s chi-square and the likelihood-ratio G-test), while Berk\u2013Jones and Higher Criticism furnish powerful tests tailored to subtle or sparse deviations\u2014precisely the watermark regime where signal is weak and dispersed across tokens. Classic, distribution-free EDF tests such as Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov offer robust baselines that can be broadly applied without heavy modeling assumptions, fitting the paper\u2019s goal of practical, model-agnostic detection.\nAt the same time, prior work in text generation and detection shapes the empirical lens. GLTR showed that simple distributional statistics over token ranks can effectively flag machine text, motivating the hypothesis that generic statistical tests may outperform bespoke detectors in practice. Holtzman et al. documented degeneration and repetition under low-temperature sampling; this paper leverages that phenomenon to reveal a distinct advantage for GoF tests that aggregate count patterns, especially when repetition amplifies deviations from the null. Together, these threads directly inform the paper\u2019s systematic evaluation showing that general GoF tests can both improve power and robustness across watermark schemes and post-editing settings.",
