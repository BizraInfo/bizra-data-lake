  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s central innovation is to unify classical improvement-based and information-theoretic Bayesian optimization by showing that Expected Improvement (EI) can be derived as a variational inference approximation to Max-value Entropy Search (MES). This builds on two foundational strands. First, Jones et al. (1998) established EI as a highly effective, expectation-based acquisition within the EGO framework. Second, a line of information-theoretic methods\u2014Villemonteix et al. (2009) via SUR, Hennig and Schuler (2012) via Entropy Search (ES), and Hern\u00e1ndez-Lobato et al. (2014) via Predictive Entropy Search (PES)\u2014recast BO as maximizing expected information gain about the optimizer. Within this lineage, Wang and Jegelka (2017) introduced MES, targeting the entropy of the maximum value and yielding a tractable, strong information-theoretic criterion.\nThe unification hinges on variational mutual information bounds, particularly the Barber\u2013Agakov (2003) framework, which enables rewriting information objectives as optimizable expectations. Leveraging these bounds, the authors show that EI emerges as a specific variational approximation to the MES objective, resolving a long-standing conceptual divide between improvement-based and entropy-based acquisitions. Building on this insight, they propose VES-Gamma, which explicitly interpolates between the strengths of EI (simplicity, exploitation efficiency) and MES (information-efficient exploration), grounded in the same variational perspective. Together, these prior works directly underwrite the new framework\u2019s theory and algorithmic design: EI as the classical baseline to be reinterpreted, MES as the target information objective, ES/PES/SUR as the information-theoretic foundations, and Barber\u2013Agakov as the variational mechanism enabling the derivation and unification.",
