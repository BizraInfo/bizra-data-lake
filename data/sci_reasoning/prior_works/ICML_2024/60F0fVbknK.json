  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of DHT-CIT\u2014recovering causal relations from subsampled time series using only two time-slices\u2014emerges from a line of work defining and stressing the subsampling problem and the limits of standard time-series causal discovery. Hyttinen et al. (2016) framed causal discovery under subsampling and exposed identifiability barriers when the measurement rate is coarser than the causal timescale, providing the precise problem formulation this paper tackles. Gong et al. (2017) further showed how temporal aggregation yields spurious dependencies that mislead conventional methods, directly motivating the need for a new strategy that remains valid under coarse sampling without relying on expensive interventions.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, leading CI-based and structural methods\u2014PCMCI (Runge et al., 2019) and SVAR/VAR-LiNGAM (Hyv\u00e4rinen et al., 2010)\u2014serve as primary baselines that presume correctly sampled dynamics; their failure modes under subsampling sharpen the gap DHT-CIT fills. The idea to operate on two observed slices is grounded in the two-slice temporal Bayes net abstraction from dynamic Bayesian networks (Murphy, 2002), while Eichler\u2019s (2012) graphical time-series causality provides the conditional independence semantics that DHT-CIT adapts to tests of descendant relations in the subsampled two-slice regime. Finally, insights from Malinsky and Spirtes (2018) on learning with latent variables inform robust CI-testing and orientation choices when many intermediate time-slices are unobserved (effectively latent). Together, these works directly shape the paper\u2019s problem, its two-slice representation, its CI-testing machinery, and the specific gaps it closes.",
