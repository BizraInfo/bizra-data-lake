  "synthesis_narrative": "DiffPuter\u2019s core innovation\u2014marrying diffusion modeling with a principled EM procedure for missing data\u2014sits at the intersection of two lines of work. The EM groundwork laid by Dempster et al. defines maximum-likelihood learning with incomplete data; DiffPuter explicitly maps diffusion-model training to the M-step and conditional sampling to the E-step. On the generative side, Ho et al.\u2019s DDPM provides the foundational denoising diffusion framework used to model the joint data distribution. Prior deep imputation methods pinpoint the gaps DiffPuter addresses: MIWAE established how to learn generative models directly from incomplete datasets but remained tied to VAE/IWAE objectives, motivating a diffusion-based alternative with stronger sample quality and a clean EM interpretation. For conditional inference from an unconditional prior, DiffPuter draws on diffusion-based conditioning strategies. RePaint\u2019s inpainting via resampling along the reverse chain directly inspires DiffPuter\u2019s tailored reverse sampler to strictly respect observed entries. In parallel, DPS showed how to perform posterior sampling with an unconditional diffusion prior under general observation operators; DiffPuter specializes and extends this idea to the missingness-mask setting for accurate conditional imputation. Against established baselines such as GAIN and VAEAC, which respectively use GANs and conditional VAEs for imputation, DiffPuter advances the field by unifying likelihood-grounded training from incomplete data with an effective, diffusion-based conditional sampling mechanism.",
