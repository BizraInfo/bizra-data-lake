  "synthesis_narrative": "Jansma\u2019s core contribution\u2014an interventional decomposition of causal effects into redundant, unique, and synergistic components\u2014sits squarely at the intersection of PID and causal inference. The structural backbone comes from Williams and Beer\u2019s PID and redundancy lattice, which define how multivariate influence can be partitioned into qualitatively distinct pieces. Harder\u2013Salge\u2013Polani\u2019s redundancy measure and Bertschinger et al.\u2019s operationalization of unique information refine the axioms and meaning of these components, ensuring that the decomposition adheres to coherent semantics when transferred from observational to causal settings.\nOn the causal side, Pearl\u2019s interventional calculus motivates replacing observational information with do-interventions as the primitive notion of causal effect, addressing Jansma\u2019s argument that a proper causal decomposition must be interventional. Ay and Polani\u2019s information-theoretic treatment of causal influence supplies concrete, intervention-based quantities that can be decomposed.\nMathematically, the work relies on M\u00f6bius inversion over the redundancy lattice to isolate redundant, unique, and synergistic terms. Rota\u2019s theory of M\u00f6bius functions on posets supplies the algebraic engine, while Ince\u2019s lattice/M\u00f6bius methodology and local measures demonstrate how to carry out such decompositions in practice and analyze systems like logic gates. By fusing these strands\u2014PID semantics, interventional causality, and lattice-based M\u00f6bius inversion\u2014Jansma derives an interventional PID that reveals how causal power is distributed and combined across variables, and shows its context- and parameter-dependence in complex systems such as logic gates, cellular automata, and chemical reaction networks.",
