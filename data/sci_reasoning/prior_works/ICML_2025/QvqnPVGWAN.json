  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of this paper is a simple, unifying theory for feature localization across generative models, grounded in stochastic localization. Eldan\u2019s introduction of stochastic localization established the key probabilistic lens: a stochastic process that incrementally concentrates a distribution onto sub-populations. Subsequent advances by Lee and collaborators (matrix stochastic localization) provided sharper, time-evolving covariance control, enabling analyses that do not hinge on Gaussian structure\u2014precisely the technical capability this work exploits to avoid distribution-specific assumptions.\n\nOn the generative modeling side, the diffusion paradigm introduced by Sohl-Dickstein and solidified by Ho et al. (DDPM) defined the stepwise denoising process where \u2018critical windows\u2019 have been repeatedly observed. Song et al.\u2019s SDE formalization furnishes a process-level language unifying diffusion dynamics with broader stochastic processes; the present paper leverages this to articulate localization over time and extend beyond Gaussian diffusion to autoregressive generation.\n\nEmpirically oriented studies in diffusion\u2014especially Karras et al.\u2019s analysis of noise-level design and Rombach et al.\u2019s latent diffusion\u2014highlight that narrow bands of timesteps disproportionately determine semantic content and final quality. These works exposed a gap: compelling evidence of critical windows but explanations tied to Gaussian schedules and specific architectures. By importing stochastic localization into the generative modeling context, this paper closes that gap, showing that sudden, step-localized behavioral shifts arise generically as the generation process localizes to sub-populations, unifying observations across diffusion and autoregressive models.",
