  "synthesis_narrative": "4K4DGen\u2019s core innovation\u2014turning a single 360\u00b0 panorama into a 4K, omnidirectional, free\u2011viewpoint 4D experience\u2014stands on two pillars: Gaussian splatting and panoramic/dynamic supervision. Kerbl et al.\u2019s 3D Gaussian Splatting provides the real\u2011time, differentiable renderer and representation that 4K4DGen directly optimizes to achieve high\u2011resolution, interactive playback. On the temporal side, D\u2011NeRF introduces the 4D problem formulation of time\u2011varying radiance fields, while subsequent dynamic Gaussian splatting work shows how to endow Gaussians with motion/deformation; 4K4DGen extends these ideas to an omnidirectional setting and scales them to 4K. For 360\u00b0 correctness, Panoramic Gaussian Splatting contributes the distortion\u2011aware equirectangular ray model that 4K4DGen generalizes from static to dynamic scenes, addressing full\u2011FOV rendering without artifacts. Mip\u2011NeRF 360 highlighted anti\u2011aliasing and optimization pitfalls in 360\u00b0 capture; 4K4DGen confronts these challenges within the Gaussian framework to retain sharpness at 4K. Finally, on the generative front, VideoPanda and 4D\u2011Fy reveal the promise and limitations of 2D panoramic video generation and diffusion\u2011driven 4D content: they animate but lack 3D consistency. 4K4DGen explicitly closes this gap by using panoramic generative supervision to optimize a coherent 4D Gaussian scene, delivering true free\u2011viewpoint, 360\u00b0 VR/AR experiences.",
