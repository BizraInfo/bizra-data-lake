  "synthesis_narrative": "The core contribution of the paper is a careful audit of complex query answering (CQA) benchmarks, showing that most queries are reducible to simpler link prediction problems and that state-of-the-art methods falter on non-reducible, truly multi-hop queries. This rests on, and reinterprets, the trajectory set by prior work. Early differentiable logic approaches such as NeuralLP demonstrated that multi-hop, rule-based reasoning over KGs is learnable, motivating the field to formalize logical query answering. GQE crystallized this into embedding-based answering of EPFO queries and introduced the canonical template-driven evaluation protocol with chain and intersection shapes. Query2Box and BetaE then advanced modeling capacity and popularized standardized query generation on FB15k-237/NELL995-style data, entrenching benchmarks that the present paper analyzes. In parallel, CQD provided a crucial insight: many complex queries can be decomposed into link prediction subproblems combined via t-norms, implicitly relying on benchmark reducibility. Subsequent strong baselines such as GNN-QE and ConE pushed performance within this same setup, reinforcing a consensus around the difficulty of CQA. The present paper synthesizes these strands by quantifying how often such queries collapse to single-edge predictions, constructing new benchmarks that enforce multi-hop reasoning, and demonstrating sharp performance drops across these influential models\u2014thereby reframing what progress in CQA should look like.",
