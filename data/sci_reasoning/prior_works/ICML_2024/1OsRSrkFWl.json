  "synthesis_narrative": "This paper fuses two mature lines of work\u2014online resource allocation and formal fairness\u2014to define and solve equity-driven allocation with sequential arrivals under distributional models. From the online allocation side, AdWords-style primal\u2013dual methods and stochastic arrival models (Mehta et al.; Feldman et al.) supply the canonical setting: resources with capacities, heterogeneous agents, and ex-ante analysis relative to a stochastic benchmark. Agrawal\u2013Devanur\u2019s online stochastic convex programming provides the technical playbook for embedding additional structure\u2014here, equity constraints\u2014into distribution-aware primal\u2013dual updates with concentration-based ex-post control.\nOn the fairness side, the external equity requirement (proportional-to-demand guarantees across arrival times) traces to proportional fairness and DRF: Kelly et al. establish convex formulations of proportional sharing, while DRF crystallizes fairness-by-demand in multi-resource environments; this paper adapts these principles to dynamic, stochastic arrivals and proves guarantees both in expectation (ex-ante) and on realized sequences (ex-post). The internal equity model maps group-level fairness to allocation: bandit fairness (Joseph et al.) clarifies ex-ante vs ex-post fairness in sequential decisions, and fair classification via reduction (Agarwal et al.) motivates implementing demographic-parity-like constraints as convex conditions that an online allocator can track. Together, these works enable the paper\u2019s core contribution: principled online policies that achieve equitable resource shares proportional to demands or group prevalence, with rigorous ex-ante and ex-post guarantees under realistic stochastic arrival assumptions.",
