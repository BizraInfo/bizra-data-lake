  "synthesis_narrative": "CrysBFN\u2019s core innovation\u2014periodic Bayesian flow with entropy conditioning\u2014emerges by fusing Bayesian-flow training with manifold-aware generative modeling for crystals. The immediate precursor is Bayesian Flow Networks (Song et al., 2023), which introduced Bayesian aggregation of noisy latents and a variance-reduced parameterization but assumed Gaussian, Euclidean noise and monotonic entropy. CrysBFN takes BFN\u2019s training paradigm as its baseline and pushes it onto periodic manifolds, where fractional atomic coordinates naturally live on a torus and entropy can evolve non-monotonically.\nFlow-matching theory (Lipman et al., 2023) and stochastic interpolants (Albergo et al., 2023) provide the methodological foundation for learning velocity fields along designed paths; CrysBFN adapts these ideas to define a periodic interpolant and to condition on entropy to handle non-Euclidean, non-monotone dynamics. The probability-flow ODE perspective from score-based SDEs (Song et al., 2021) supplies the formal link between stochastic and deterministic transports that CrysBFN exploits when crafting its Bayesian flow on manifolds. Crucially, inspiration from Riemannian score-based generative modeling (De Bortoli et al., 2022) motivates replacing Gaussian Euclidean noise with manifold-consistent perturbations on periodic domains.\nOn the application side, early diffusion generators for crystals\u2014CDVAE and DiffCSP\u2014demonstrated feasibility but exposed limitations in treating periodic symmetry and coupling lattice/coordinate variables. CrysBFN directly addresses these gaps by formulating a periodic, manifold-consistent Bayesian flow with explicit entropy conditioning, yielding a principled alternative to Euclidean diffusion heuristics for crystal generation.",
