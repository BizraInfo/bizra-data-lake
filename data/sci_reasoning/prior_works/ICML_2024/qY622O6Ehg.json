  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014showing that strategically pausing policy updates can improve performance in nonstationary reinforcement learning and yield sharper dynamic-regret bounds\u2014rests on three intellectual pillars. First, the formal notion of nonstationarity and performance is inherited from dynamic-regret frameworks. Besbes et al. (2014) introduce variation-budget measures for nonstationary decision problems, while Hall and Willett (2015) establish dynamic-regret analysis via path-length, both of which the paper leverages to precisely quantify how update/hold schedules affect regret. Second, the paper integrates forecasting into online policy learning, directly extending the optimistic/predictive paradigm of Rakhlin and Sridharan (2013) to the RL setting. This forecasting lens is used to manage aleatoric uncertainty and to analytically justify an optimal non-zero hold ratio. Third, the work challenges the prevailing baseline in nonstationary RL\u2014algorithms that continually update policies, typified by the dynamic-regret methods for nonstationary MDPs (Cheung et al., 2019)\u2014by proving that non-zero holds can strictly tighten regret bounds. Two practice-driven inspirations further ground the idea: TD3\u2019s delayed actor updates (Fujimoto et al., 2018) and DQN\u2019s periodically updated target network (Mnih et al., 2015) both suggest benefits of restrained update schedules, while event/self-triggered control (Heemels et al., 2012) provides a sample-and-hold perspective. The paper unifies these strands to compute an optimal update/hold ratio and to demonstrate, theoretically and empirically, that pausing policy learning can outperform continuous updating in time-varying environments.",
