  "synthesis_narrative": "Latent diffusion models introduced the idea of performing generative modeling in a learned VAE latent space, where a non-linear encoder/decoder trades sample quality and efficiency against the difficulty of imposing constraints in image space. Diffusion Posterior Sampling established a practical way to solve inverse problems by injecting the likelihood gradient as a soft data-consistency correction within reverse diffusion. Denoising Diffusion Restoration Models demonstrated that hard data consistency can be achieved in the diffusion loop for linear degradations with pixel-space models via closed-form conditioning, highlighting both the power and the limitations of exact consistency. ILVR showed that repeatedly enforcing a degradation-driven constraint during sampling (e.g., by replacing low-frequency components) can strongly condition the generation process, pointing to projection-style updates as effective controls. SDEdit clarified how adding the correct amount of forward noise and then denoising keeps samples on the appropriate noise manifold, a key consideration when interleaving external constraints. Finally, Plug-and-Play Priors provided the core algorithmic pattern of alternating a data-fidelity proximal step with a learned prior, foreshadowing optimization-in-the-loop conditioning.\nTogether, these works exposed a gap: soft guidance can be unstable or biased for challenging operators, while hard consistency was confined to pixel-space and linear models, and naive projections can drift off the diffusion trajectory. The current paper synthesizes these elements by embedding an optimization-based hard data-consistency step inside latent diffusion and immediately resampling to return to the noisy manifold, thus generalizing the ILVR/DDRM-style exact conditioning to nonlinear and latent settings while preserving the principled trajectory control suggested by SDEdit and the PnP paradigm.",

    "abstract": "Latent diffusion models have been demonstrated to generate high-quality images, while offering efficiency in model training compared to diffusion models operating in the pixel space. However, incorporating latent diffusion models to solve inverse problems remains a challenging problem due to the nonlinearity of the encoder and decoder. To address these issues, we propose ReSample, an algorithm that can solve general inverse problems with pre-trained latent diffusion models. Our algorithm incorporates data consistency by solving an optimization problem during the reverse sampling process, a concept that we term as hard data consistency. Upon solving this optimization problem, we propose a novel resampling scheme to map the measurement-consistent sample back onto the noisy data manifold and theoretically demonstrate its benefits. Lastly, we apply our algorithm to solve a wide range of linear and nonlinear inverse problems in both natural and medical images, demonstrating that our approac",
