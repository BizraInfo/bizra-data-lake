  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014rigorously formulating and analyzing preconditioned Langevin dynamics driven by score-based generative priors directly in infinite-dimensional function spaces\u2014sits at the intersection of function-space Bayesian inversion, Hilbert-space SDE theory, score-based generative modeling, and Langevin convergence with inexact gradients. Stuart (2010) provides the foundational function-space Bayesian framework and metrics (e.g., KL) needed to pose and analyze inverse problems independently of discretization. Building on this, Cotter et al. (2013) established dimension-independent, preconditioned MCMC for functions (pCN), directly informing the necessity and form of preconditioning to maintain stability and mesh-robustness in the proposed Langevin scheme. The rigorous definition of Langevin dynamics in Hilbert spaces relies on Da Prato and Zabczyk\u2019s theory of infinite-dimensional SDEs.\nOn the modeling side, Hyv\u00e4rinen\u2019s score matching (2005) legitimizes learning gradients of log densities, while Song et al. (2021) supply the modern SDE-based SGM machinery that links learned scores to Langevin-type sampling. Practical impetus comes from Chung et al. (2022), showing the promise of diffusion priors for linear inverse problems but without function-space guarantees. Crucially, the paper\u2019s KL convergence bounds that depend explicitly on score approximation error are conceptually grounded in Dalalyan and Karagulyan\u2019s analysis of Langevin with inaccurate gradients. Integrating these strands, the paper delivers a function-space, preconditioned Langevin sampler with SGM priors and the first error and convergence guarantees that scale with score approximation quality, ensuring stability and global KL convergence under mesh refinement.",
