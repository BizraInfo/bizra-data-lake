  "synthesis_narrative": "The core advance of Interventional Causal Representation Learning is to prove identifiability of latent causal factors from interventional data by exploiting geometric signatures on the supports of latent variables. This direction is motivated by Locatello et al.\u2019s impossibility result for observational disentanglement, which makes explicit that additional signals\u2014such as interventions\u2014are required. Pearl\u2019s do-calculus provides the foundational semantics of perfect interventions that our theorems assume, specifying how do-operations sever ancestral dependencies in the latent causal graph. Technically, our work connects to the nonlinear ICA line that established identifiability from distributional shifts across environments: Hyvarinen and Morioka\u2019s time-contrastive learning first showed how environment-induced changes can break nonlinear mixing, and Khemakhem et al.\u2019s iVAE formalized identifiability with auxiliary variables. We extend this paradigm by treating interventions as a special, structured auxiliary variable and by focusing on the intervention-induced changes in support geometry, which allow us to prove identification up to permutation and scaling even when latents are causally dependent. Furthermore, our block-affine identifiability result is informed by the ISA perspective (Cardoso), clarifying that remaining ambiguities manifest as block-wise transformations. Relative to empirical interventional CRL methods like CITRIS, which rely on temporal sequences and offer limited general theory, we provide global identifiability guarantees from general perfect interventions without temporal assumptions, thereby closing a key theoretical gap.",
