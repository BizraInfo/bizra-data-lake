  "synthesis_narrative": "Trajectory Flow Matching (TFM) fuses insights from flow-based generative modeling with continuous-time sequence modeling to train Neural SDEs without backpropagating through stochastic solvers. The central idea\u2014regressing a velocity field along interpolated trajectories in a simulation-free manner\u2014traces directly to Flow Matching for Generative Modeling. Stochastic Interpolants provides the theoretical lens to define and analyze objectives on interpolated paths and conditional velocities, which TFM leverages to establish necessary conditions for learning time-series dynamics. Conditional Flow Matching contributes the practical blueprint for simulation-free training of continuous-time flows; TFM adapts this conditioning to observed time-series segments so the learned Neural SDE captures both drift and diffusion consistent with data. To improve stability, TFM\u2019s reparameterization trick draws on Rectified Flow\u2019s core insight: choosing well-conditioned (often straight-line or otherwise simplified) interpolants yields easier velocity regression and more robust optimization. On the application side, Latent ODEs and Neural CDEs shape TFM\u2019s handling of irregularly sampled clinical data, providing architectural and modeling principles for continuous-time latent dynamics and controlled paths. Together, these works directly enable TFM\u2019s key contribution: a simulation-free, stable training procedure for Neural SDEs that scales to irregular, stochastic clinical time series without differentiating through SDE simulations.",
