  "synthesis_narrative": "ACES fuses two influential strands: intrinsic motivation for autotelic task generation and quality-diversity search over interpretable descriptors. From the curriculum-learning side, GoalGAN and Teacher\u2013Student Curriculum Learning showed that a solver\u2019s success rate is a rich signal to target goals on the frontier of competence\u2014challenging but learnable. ACES adopts this principle almost verbatim by defining problem difficulty as an inverse function of a strong LLM solver\u2019s success rate and steering generation toward those hard-yet-solvable regions.\n\nFrom the diversity side, MAP-Elites established how to simultaneously maximize coverage of a descriptor space while optimizing a quality measure. ACES mirrors this architecture by representing programming problems in an LLM-defined semantic descriptor space (e.g., dynamic programming, string manipulation) and seeking broad coverage while pushing difficulty upward. POET extends this logic to open-ended, co-evolving environments and solvers; ACES echoes POET\u2019s autotelic loop by iteratively generating new problems and evaluating solvability with a capable solver, thus maintaining a moving frontier of challenge.\n\nFinally, autotelic goal exploration work in IMGEP and follow-ups on language-grounded goals supplied the representational and conceptual substrate for ACES\u2019 descriptor design. The choice to let language models produce semantic skill tags and to drive exploration through these tags is a direct continuation of using language to structure goal spaces. Together, these works crystallize in ACES as a QD-style, autotelic loop guided by solver success\u2014now instantiated with LLMs as both designer (problem generator/descriptor annotator) and evaluator (difficulty estimator).",
