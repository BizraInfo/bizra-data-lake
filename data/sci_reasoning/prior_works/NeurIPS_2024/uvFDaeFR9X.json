  "synthesis_narrative": "This work sits at the intersection of model-based high-order methods for monotone variational inequalities and error-aware complexity theory. Rockafellar\u2019s proximal-point framework provides the globalization backbone: a regularized monotone inclusion whose inexact solution still ensures global progress. Monteiro and Svaiter formalized a hybrid proximal\u2013extragradient scaffold that modern high-order schemes use to define and (approximately) solve a model-based auxiliary problem; the present paper operates squarely within this paradigm while tracking Jacobian inexactness. Nesterov\u2019s Taylor-regularized tensor methods supply the model-minimization template and optimal rates under exact oracles. Kamzolov and Gasnikov extended these ideas to monotone VIs, establishing optimal second-order/tensor rates in the exact-derivative setting\u2014the benchmark this paper matches when the Jacobian is exact.\n\nThe new ingredient is an explicit, sharp dependence on Jacobian inaccuracy in both lower bounds and algorithmic guarantees. Here, two lines of prior work are pivotal: Devolder\u2013Glineur\u2013Nesterov\u2019s inexact-oracle complexity framework, which articulates how oracle errors should enter rates, and Cartis\u2013Gould\u2013Toint\u2019s inexact second-order analyses, which show how Hessian errors propagate in cubic-regularized steps. Finally, the design of practical quasi-Newton Jacobian updates and their globalization is grounded in the classical VI literature synthesized by Facchinei and Pang. Together, these works enable the authors to (i) derive lower bounds reflecting Jacobian error, (ii) design an algorithm that is optimal in the exact limit, and (iii) introduce quasi-Newton approximations that retain global sublinear convergence while reducing inner-solve cost.",
