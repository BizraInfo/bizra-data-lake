  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014a unified, fine-grained generalization analysis for re-weighting and logit-adjustment in imbalanced learning\u2014sits at the intersection of practical imbalance-aware losses and classical generalization theory. On the algorithmic side, focal loss (Lin et al., 2017) and class-balanced loss (Cui et al., 2019) epitomize re-weighting schemes that prioritize difficult or minority-class examples, while LDAM (Cao et al., 2019) and logit adjustment (Menon et al., 2020) implement class-dependent shifts/margins at the logit level grounded in Bayes priors and balanced error objectives. Empirically successful yet theoretically fragmented, these methods motivated a unifying analysis capable of differentiating effects across majority and minority classes.\nClassical learning bounds for importance weighting (Cortes, Mansour, Mohri, 2010) and foundational Rademacher complexity results (Bartlett and Mendelson, 2002) provide the backbone for bounding excess risk under re-weighted ERM, but they remain coarse, applying a single global contraction based on Lipschitz constants. Maurer\u2019s vector-contraction inequality (2016) refines how composite losses are handled, yet still lacks granularity tailored to class-wise imbalance.\nThe present work advances this line by introducing data-dependent contraction, which calibrates the contraction step to the class distribution and the specific loss modification (weights or logit shifts). This yields class-aware generalization bounds that recover and clarify when re-weighting, logit adjustment, or margin-based corrections help minority classes without degrading majority-class performance. In doing so, it theoretically rationalizes the empirical success of focal, class-balanced, LDAM, and logit-adjusted training within a single, principled framework.",
