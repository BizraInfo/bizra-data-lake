  "synthesis_narrative": "LIM stands at the intersection of score-based generative modeling and L\u00e9vy-process theory. Its sampling and training pipelines directly inherit from score-based diffusion models: Sohl-Dickstein et al. introduced the forward noising/reverse denoising paradigm, while Song et al. unified this paradigm with reverse-time SDEs and noise-conditioned score estimation. On the objective side, Hyv\u00e4rinen\u2019s score matching and Vincent\u2019s denoising score matching constitute the estimation backbone that LIM generalizes to non-Gaussian, heavy-tailed corruptions, leading to a fractional denoising score matching objective aligned with the generator of \u03b1-stable semigroups.\n\nThe theoretical leap in LIM is to replace Brownian motion with isotropic \u03b1-stable L\u00e9vy processes. This requires moving from continuous-path diffusions to jump processes: Anderson\u2019s reverse-time construction provides the conceptual and technical basis for deriving exact reverse dynamics, which LIM adapts to L\u00e9vy-driven SDEs. The necessary stochastic calculus, L\u00e9vy\u2013It\u00f4 decomposition, and generator characterization via the fractional Laplacian come from Applebaum\u2019s treatment of L\u00e9vy SDEs, while Samorodnitsky and Taqqu supply the heavy-tailed, infinite-variance properties that motivate L\u00e9vy noise for faster exploration and mode coverage.\n\nBy synthesizing these strands, LIM formalizes a reverse-time SDE under \u03b1-stable drivers and a matching training criterion that respects the fractional generator, thereby achieving faster sampling (lower NFE) and improved diversity relative to Gaussian diffusion while maintaining high fidelity.",
