  "synthesis_narrative": "SoftShape\u2019s core innovation\u2014soft sparsification of shapelets via contribution scores and consolidation of low-importance subsequences\u2014emerges directly from the shapelet lineage and efficiency-driven gaps in prior work. Ye and Keogh (2009) established the shapelet paradigm, defining discriminative subsequences and a distance-based feature view that underpins SoftShape\u2019s representational choices. Subsequent systems such as Lines et al. (2012) and the Shapelet Transform of Hills et al. (2014) operationalized shapelets through top-k selection and dataset transformation, but their efficiency hinged on hard filtering, inevitably discarding potentially informative subsequences. End-to-end approaches like Learning Time-Series Shapelets (Grabocka et al., 2014) improved learnability and accuracy, yet still relied on fixed budgets and implicit hard selection, leaving a gap between efficiency and information retention. Fast Shapelets (Rakthanmanon et al., 2013) made discovery practical at scale through aggressive pruning, but at the cost of excluding weaker patterns that may matter in aggregate. SoftShape directly tackles this long-standing tension by replacing discard-based sparsification with a contribution-score\u2013guided, differentiable soft consolidation: lower-scored shapes are merged into a single soft representative so all subsequence information is retained yet compacted. The design echoes the token-merging idea from vision transformers (Bolya et al., 2023), which demonstrated that merging low-importance units preserves utility while cutting compute. Building on these foundations, SoftShape adds a soft-shape learning block to model intra- and inter-shape temporal structure efficiently, thus unifying interpretability, fidelity, and speed within the shapelet framework.",
