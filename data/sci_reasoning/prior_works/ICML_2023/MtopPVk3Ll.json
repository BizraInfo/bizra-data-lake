  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014bringing exact mixed-effects inference to deep neural networks for clustered, spatio\u2011temporal data\u2014rests squarely on the hierarchical likelihood lineage. Lee and Nelder\u2019s Hierarchical Likelihood established the key idea: treat random effects as parameters with a joint objective (the h-likelihood) so that fixed effects, dispersion, and random effects can be optimized together. Their subsequent monograph broadened this into a unified computational toolkit, clarifying how BLUPs and REML arise naturally within h-likelihood\u2014machinery the present work translates to modern DNN mean structures and high-cardinality grouped effects. Classical mixed-model theory supplies the targets: Henderson\u2019s BLUP defines the optimal prediction criterion for random effects, and Patterson\u2013Thompson\u2019s REML provides the variance-component estimation principle that the proposed two-step algorithm computes within the h-likelihood framework. The paper is explicitly motivated by limitations of dominant scalable approaches for correlated data: Breslow\u2013Clayton\u2019s Laplace/PQL approximations and Ormerod\u2013Wand\u2019s variational GLMMs both trade accuracy for speed, yielding only approximate MLEs. Crucially, the most relevant deep-learning predecessor\u2014Tran, Nguyen, and Nott\u2019s Bayesian Deep Net GLM/GLMM\u2014integrates deep feature learning with mixed effects but relies on variational Bayes, again producing approximate inference. By re-grounding deep models in the h-likelihood, this work directly addresses those gaps: it delivers exact MLEs for mean and dispersion parameters, BLUPs for random effects, and a computable REML procedure suited to spatio\u2011temporal structures and high-cardinality categorical features.",
