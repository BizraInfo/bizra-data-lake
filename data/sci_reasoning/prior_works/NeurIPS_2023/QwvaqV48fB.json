  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014exploiting holistic predictive trends over training while balancing positives and unlabeled samples per iteration\u2014sits at the intersection of PU risk theory, sampling design, and temporal modeling of predictions. Elkan and Noto (2008) and du Plessis\u2013Niu\u2013Sugiyama (2014) supplied the foundational PU viewpoint and unbiased risk formulations, defining the statistical constraints that make PU learning prone to bias and error accumulation when treated myopically at each epoch. Kiryo et al. (2017) addressed these issues via a non-negative risk estimator for deep PU, a stabilization mechanism the present work complements by shifting attention from instantaneous risk to the evolution of predictions. On the sampling side, Mordelet and Vert (2014) empirically showed that balancing P and U through resampling/bagging markedly benefits PU performance, directly echoing the paper\u2019s key observation that per-iteration positive resampling to balance P\u2013U yields strong early-stage behavior. Sakai\u2013Niu\u2013Sugiyama (2018) further underscored the importance of balanced interactions between P and U through pairwise AUC objectives, reinforcing the role of distributional balance in shaping learning dynamics. Finally, the paper\u2019s temporal perspective draws clear inspiration from temporal ensembling (Laine & Aila, 2017), which aggregates predictions across epochs, and from the early-learning phenomenon (Arpit et al., 2017), which explains why early, balanced training carries more reliable signals. Together, these works directly scaffold the paper\u2019s trend-centric, balanced-iteration approach to robust PU learning.",
