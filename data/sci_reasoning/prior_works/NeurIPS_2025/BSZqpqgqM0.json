  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014identifying a dynamical window where diffusion models generalize before eventually memorizing, with \u03c4_mem scaling linearly in dataset size n while \u03c4_gen remains roughly constant\u2014coalesces ideas from optimization stability, training-time generalization phenomena, and the specific objectives underpinning diffusion models. The algorithmic stability analysis of SGD (Hardt et al., 2016) provides the key theoretical lens: generalization degrades with training steps and improves with larger datasets, implying a training-time threshold proportional to n to avoid overfitting. This dovetails with epoch-wise double descent (Nakkiran et al., 2020), which empirically maps an early generalization phase followed by overfitting as training continues, mirroring the paper\u2019s \u03c4_gen/\u03c4_mem separation.\n\nArpit et al. (2017) supply a mechanistic interpretation: networks learn simple, shared structure before memorizing idiosyncrasies, consistent with diffusion models producing high-quality samples early and only later replicating specifics. The methodological groundwork from DDPM (Ho et al., 2020) and score-based SDE modeling (Song & Ermon, 2020) defines the loss and continuous-time view required to analyze the diffusion training dynamics across noise levels. Vincent\u2019s denoising score matching (2011) frames denoising as an intrinsic regularizer, which this work extends into a time-dependent, implicit dynamical regularization explanation. Finally, empirical demonstrations of training-data extraction from diffusion models (Carlini et al., 2023) motivate and validate the focus on memorization onset, providing practical protocols that the present study systematizes to reveal \u03c4_mem \u221d n and a robust generalization window.",
