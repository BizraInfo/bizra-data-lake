  "synthesis_narrative": "Flow Matching introduced a simulation-free recipe for generative modeling by constructing closed-form target vector fields that steer an ODE from a base to data; crucially, it made matching depend on an L2 geometry that yields tractable velocities. Stochastic Interpolants formalized the broader principle of defining time-dependent interpolations and matching the associated drift, tying together flows and diffusions and showing that estimating a vector field can replace costly score estimation or SDE simulation. Rectified Flow emphasized training deterministic ODE transports directly\u2014without simulating stochastic processes\u2014by aligning a learned velocity with a prescribed path between base and data. On manifolds, Riemannian Score-Based Generative Modeling framed diffusion-based generation but required simulating Brownian motion and approximating manifold scores via heat-kernel machinery, yielding significant computational overhead. FFJORD established CNFs as likelihood-based models but relied on stochastic trace estimators for divergence, a bottleneck exacerbated by manifold constraints. Diffusion Maps provided a practical spectral framework for computing heat-kernel-based quantities via Laplace\u2013Beltrami eigenfunctions, enabling efficient, geometry-aware kernels. Together these works revealed that (i) simulation-free velocity matching can replace divergence computation and SDE simulation, and (ii) spectral heat-kernel tools provide tractable manifold geometry. The natural next step was to transplant flow-matching to arbitrary manifolds by swapping the Euclidean metric for a Laplace\u2013Beltrami-based premetric computed spectrally, yielding closed-form, manifold-aware target vector fields and training objectives that sidestep both divergence estimation and stochastic simulation.",

    "abstract": "We propose Riemannian Flow Matching (RFM), a simple yet powerful framework for training continuous normalizing flows on manifolds. Existing methods for generative modeling on manifolds either require expensive simulation, are inherently unable to scale to high dimensions, or use approximations for limiting quantities that result in biased training objectives. Riemannian Flow Matching bypasses these limitations and offers several advantages over previous approaches: it is simulation-free on simple geometries, does not require divergence computation, and computes its target vector field in closed-form. The key ingredient behind RFM is the construction of a relatively simple premetric for defining target vector fields, which encompasses the existing Euclidean case. To extend to general geometries, we rely on the use of spectral decompositions to efficiently compute premetrics on the fly. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world non-Euclidean datasets, and we demonstr",
