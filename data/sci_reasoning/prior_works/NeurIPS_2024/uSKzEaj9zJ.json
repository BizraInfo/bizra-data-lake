  "synthesis_narrative": "The Nonlocal Attention Operator (NAO) crystallizes two converging lines of work: attention as a universal nonlocal aggregator and neural operators as mappings between function spaces for PDEs. The self-attention mechanism from Vaswani et al. constitutes the computational primitive NAO reinterprets, while Wang et al.\u2019s non-local networks explicitly connected attention-like weighting to nonlocal integral behavior over spatial tokens\u2014precisely the lens through which NAO views attention as a data-dependent integral kernel. In parallel, neural operator research (Li et al.\u2019s Graph Kernel Network and the Fourier Neural Operator) established that learning PDE solution operators benefits from global, nonlocal kernels, with FNO showing spectral global mixing as an efficient operator prior. DeepONet further formalized operator learning from function pairs, framing the task NAO tackles: mapping data to function-valued outputs.\nNAO\u2019s key step is to materialize the attention kernel as a double-integral operator whose weights depend on observed data, turning attention into an interpretable, nonlocal inverse operator that recovers hidden parameter fields. This directly addresses ill-posed inverse PDE problems articulated in the PINN literature, but via an operator-learning route that emphasizes data-dependent nonlocality rather than hard physics constraints. Finally, peridynamics provides the physical foundation for nonlocal integral operators, aligning NAO\u2019s attention kernel with physically meaningful interactions and enabling interpretability of the inferred fields. Together, these works lead to NAO\u2019s contribution: an attention-based neural operator that unifies nonlocal physics priors with data-driven kernels for interpretable inverse modeling.",
