  "synthesis_narrative": "This paper\u2019s core contribution is to bring a scaling-law lens to language model robustness, quantifying how model size and attack/defense compute shape vulnerability, adversarial training efficiency, and transfer across attacks. Kaplan et al. (2020) and Hoffmann et al. (2022) provide the methodological foundation: rigorously relating performance to parameters, data, and compute, and defining compute-optimal regimes. Building on these, the authors recast robustness as a quantity to be measured along similar scaling curves, enabling principled comparisons of sample- and compute-efficiency.\nOn the defense side, Madry et al. (2018) supply the canonical adversarial training framework whose costs and benefits are examined at LLM scale; the paper\u2019s finding that scale improves sample efficiency but worsens compute efficiency mirrors classic robustness tradeoffs under more stringent objectives. On the attack side, Wallace et al. (2019) and Zou et al. (2023) demonstrate optimization-based, transferable text attacks\u2014precursors to modern jailbreaks\u2014where success rises with search budget. This motivates and grounds the paper\u2019s key result that attack success increases smoothly with attack compute for both undefended and adversarially trained models. Perez et al. (2022) further motivates compute-amortized, automated red teaming and cross-model transfer, which the paper formalizes across families and tasks. Finally, Bai et al. (2022) situate the role of explicit safety training; by contrasting settings with and without such training, the paper shows that scale alone does not reliably yield robustness, clarifying where alignment interventions matter in the scaling regime.",
