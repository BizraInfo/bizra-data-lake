  "synthesis_narrative": "Scaled dot-product attention provides a powerful content-addressed memory, but it lacks an inherent mechanism for enforcing stack-like discipline. Work on differentiable data structures showed a way forward: Grefenstette et al. introduced neural controllers with a differentiable stack, using soft push/pop operations to endow networks with pushdown memory. Joulin and Mikolov demonstrated that such stack-augmented networks learn algorithmic and context-free patterns like balanced parentheses, validating the pushdown mechanism as the right inductive bias for hierarchical structure. In parallel, Dyer et al.\u2019s Stack LSTMs used an explicit stack to model parsing decisions, highlighting the tight connection between stack state and syntactic structure. Formal theory underpins these insights: Hopcroft, Motwani, and Ullman established that pushdown automata capture exactly the context-free languages and that nondeterminism strictly expands power beyond deterministic PDAs. Counterbalancing these positives, Hahn proved that fixed-depth self-attention cannot recognize unbounded hierarchical patterns such as Dyck languages, revealing a core limitation of standard attention.\nTogether these strands expose a clear opportunity: attention\u2019s flexible addressing needs an explicit pushdown controller to handle unbounded hierarchy. The natural next step is to graft a differentiable PDA onto attention itself\u2014preserving the Transformer\u2019s strengths while injecting stack discipline as a latent, unsupervised syntactic model. Further, classical results motivate offering both deterministic and nondeterministic variants so the mechanism can span deterministic subsets and the full class of context-free languages.",

    "abstract": "Attention, specifically scaled dot-product attention, has proven effective for natural language, but it does not have a mechanism for handling hierarchical patterns of arbitrary nesting depth, which limits its ability to recognize certain syntactic structures. To address this shortcoming, we propose stack attention: an attention operator that incorporates stacks, inspired by their theoretical connections to context-free languages (CFLs). We show that stack attention is analogous to standard attention, but with a latent model of syntax that requires no syntactic supervision. We propose two variants: one related to deterministic pushdown automata (PDAs) and one based on nondeterministic PDAs, which allows transformers to recognize arbitrary CFLs. We show that transformers with stack attention are very effective at learning CFLs that standard transformers struggle on, achieving strong results on a CFL with theoretically maximal parsing difficulty. We also show that stack attention is more",
