  "synthesis_narrative": "Trajectory Aggregation Tree (TAT) is motivated by the success and limitations of diffusion-based planners. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models established the non-autoregressive generative machinery that enables trajectory-level sampling, and Diffuser extended this idea to decision-making, showing strong long-horizon performance but also exposing the practical risk of infeasible samples due to stochasticity. Prior attempts to steer diffusion outputs\u2014such as classifier-free guidance\u2014modify the sampling dynamics or require auxiliary conditioning; in contrast, TAT aims to be training- and sampler-agnostic.\nTo achieve robustness without retraining, TAT synthesizes ideas from sample-based planning and tree search. PETS popularized sampling many trajectories and selecting elites (often via CEM), illustrating how aggregate statistics over trajectories can improve reliability; TAT generalizes this by organizing repeated diffusion rollouts into a dynamic state/trajectory tree, rather than committing to a single elite path. Classical tree-search principles further inspire TAT\u2019s structure: UCT shows how simulated rollouts can populate a search tree with principled node prioritization, while RRT demonstrates how sampling can grow trees that explore feasible regions of state space. Finally, MBPO\u2019s use of ensembles and multiple rollouts to temper model bias aligns with TAT\u2019s core mechanism\u2014marginalizing unreliable states/branches by pooling evidence across historical and current predictions. Together, these strands directly inform TAT\u2019s key contribution: a training-free, trajectory-aggregation tree that prioritizes robust nodes and resists stochastic failure modes of diffusion planners.",
