  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014using the singular value decomposition of the query\u2013key interaction matrix (Wq^T Wk) to dissect how Vision Transformers (ViTs) balance perceptual grouping and contextualization\u2014builds on three converging lines of prior work. First, ViT (Dosovitskiy et al.) established the architectural and mathematical substrate of dot\u2011product self\u2011attention with learned query and key projections, making Wq and Wk the natural locus for probing content-based interactions. Second, the mechanistic interpretability literature (Elhage et al.; Olsson et al.) formalized \u201cQK circuits,\u201d explicitly analyzing WQ^T WK to explain systematic attention behaviors (e.g., induction heads). This work directly inspires shifting analysis from observed attention weights to the spectral structure of the QK weight product, where singular vectors can reveal intrinsic relational features encoded by heads independent of specific inputs. Third, vision-specific interpretability studies (Caron et al.\u2019s DINO; Abnar & Zuidema) showed that ViT attention captures semantically meaningful structures and offered tools to trace attention across layers, while Raghu et al. characterized a local-to-global, early-to-late transition in ViTs. The present paper synthesizes these threads: it leverages the QK-circuit perspective to examine Wq^T Wk via SVD, aligns the resulting singular directions with semantic interactions observed in ViT attention maps (as in DINO), and refines the known layerwise transition by demonstrating a shift from similar-token (grouping) to dissimilar-token (contextual) attention\u2014especially in classification-trained models. This weight-space spectral view yields interpretable, training-objective-sensitive insights into how ViTs organize token relations.",
