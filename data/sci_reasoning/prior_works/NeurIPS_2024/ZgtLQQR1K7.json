  "synthesis_narrative": "VMamba\u2019s core contribution\u2014adapting selective state-space modeling to vision with a 2D Selective Scan (SS2D)\u2014emerges from a clear lineage in sequence modeling and 2D context aggregation. The theoretical foundation is the Structured State Space (S4) framework, which demonstrated how parameterized SSMs can capture long-range dependencies with linear-time complexity. Building on S4, Mamba introduced selective scanning and input-dependent gating, delivering practical, hardware-aware linear-time sequence modeling. VMamba directly extends Mamba\u2019s selective scan from 1D to 2D, designing SS2D to traverse images along four complementary routes to aggregate diverse contextual cues without incurring quadratic cost.\n\nPrior attempts to bring SSMs to multidimensional data, notably S4ND, underscored both the promise and the challenges of applying state-space formulations beyond 1D, motivating VMamba\u2019s explicit bridging mechanism between sequential and grid-structured data. The idea of multi-directional traversals across images has deep roots in multi-dimensional RNNs (MDLSTM) and ReNet, which scanned images along rows, columns, or multiple directions to capture global context\u2014an idea VMamba modernizes with state-space updates and selective gating for efficiency and scalability.\n\nFinally, VMamba adopts successful architectural patterns from vision Transformers: ViT\u2019s tokenization paradigm and Swin\u2019s hierarchical, multi-stage design inform how VSS blocks are assembled into a competitive general-purpose backbone. Together, these prior works directly shaped VMamba\u2019s SS2D module, VSS block design, and overall architecture, yielding a vision backbone that achieves strong accuracy while maintaining linear-time scaling.",
