  "synthesis_narrative": "SQS fuses two lines of progress: query-centric transformers for autonomous driving and differentiable multi-view rendering. On the rendering side, NeRF inaugurated view-synthesis as a powerful self-supervised signal, while 3D Gaussian Splatting replaced volumetric fields with efficient, stable, and differentiable 3D Gaussians. SQS adopts this representation not as an end in itself, but as a pretraining target: it asks sparse queries to predict Gaussian parameters and uses splatting-based reconstruction of multi-view images and depth to inject fine-grained geometric and photometric priors into the queries. On the transformer side, DETR introduced the notion of learnable queries and interaction mechanisms, refined by Deformable DETR\u2019s reference-point sampling. In multi-camera 3D perception, DETR3D\u2019s 3D-to-2D querying and BEVFormer\u2019s cross-view deformable attention provided the mechanics to connect 3D queries to multi-view features, while Sparse4D demonstrated that efficient sparse perception models can eschew dense BEV/volumetric construction entirely. SQS synthesizes these ideas: it replaces point-like references with richer Gaussian primitives during pretraining, leverages cross-view deformable sampling to couple queries with images, and then uses DETR-style query interaction to bridge pre-trained Gaussian queries with task-specific queries for occupancy and detection. This pretraining-to-finetuning pathway directly targets SPMs, yielding stronger context encoding without sacrificing their hallmark efficiency.",
