  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014a sharp characterization of entrywise functions f that yield universally low-rank attention matrices f(QK\u1d40) when n \u226b d\u2014sits at the intersection of kernel methods, fast attention, and harmonic analysis. On the mathematical side, Schoenberg\u2019s seminal analysis of positive definite functions on spheres laid the representation-theoretic groundwork: O(d)-invariant dot-product kernels decompose into spherical harmonics (Gegenbauer polynomials), and finite-dimensionality corresponds to truncating this expansion. Menegatto\u2019s follow-ups further tied finite harmonic truncations to finite-dimensional RKHS, implying that only polynomial kernels can be exactly finite-rank. From the machine learning perspective, the polynomial kernel lineage dating back to Cortes\u2013Vapnik provided the constructive examples: low-degree polynomials in \u27e8q, k\u27e9 factor through symmetric tensor features, guaranteeing low rank independent of sequence length. In contrast, Rahimi\u2013Recht\u2019s random features and subsequent fast-attention works (Katharopoulos et al.\u2019s linear attention and Choromanski et al.\u2019s Performers) operationalized linear-time attention by approximating non-polynomial kernels such as softmax, thereby relying on approximate finite-dimensional embeddings. Nystr\u00f6mformer\u2019s low-rank approximations similarly exploit empirical low-rank structure without exact guarantees. Synthesizing these threads, the paper uses group representation theory to prove a definitive boundary: among piecewise continuous entrywise transforms of QK\u1d40, only polynomials can ensure universal low rank, explaining why non-polynomial fast attention must be approximate and consolidating the theoretical limits of kernelizable attention.",
