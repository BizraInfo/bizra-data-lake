  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core idea\u2014injecting complementary frame\u2013event fusion into a diffusion model for optical flow\u2014sits at the intersection of discriminative flow estimation, event-based vision, and conditional diffusion. RAFT established the dominant discriminative paradigm for optical flow with strong matching and iterative refinement, yet it degrades under motion blur and low light, the very regimes targeted here. Event-based works like EV-FlowNet and E-RAFT showed that events offer temporally precise, HDR-aligned boundary cues that remain reliable under such degradations, but they also revealed the insufficiency of events alone to recover rich appearance and texture. E2VID further crystallized the complementary nature of events and frames, illustrating how events can supply boundary completeness while frames provide dense appearance, thereby motivating explicit, synergistic fusion rather than simple feature concatenation or domain adaptation.\nOn the generative side, DDPM laid the groundwork for leveraging diffusion as a robust, uncertainty-aware estimator, enabling the model to represent ambiguous motions prevalent in blurred/noisy scenes. Palette demonstrated that diffusion scales to conditional dense prediction, making optical flow a natural target. Finally, ControlNet provided a concrete architectural recipe for injecting structured guidance into diffusion networks without disrupting training stability. Together, these strands directly motivate the paper\u2019s design: use a diffusion backbone (DDPM/Palette) and inject a control-like, complementary fusion of frame appearance and event boundaries (in the spirit of ControlNet), overcoming RAFT-style brittleness while capitalizing on the proven strengths of event sensing.",
