  "synthesis_narrative": "MKGL\u2019s core idea is to recast knowledge graph completion as generation in a deliberately constrained three-word language and to stabilize that generation with explicit KG grounding. Classical KGE methods\u2014TransE and successors like ComplEx and RotatE\u2014defined the link prediction task and established strong embedding baselines centered on triple representations, but they lack the flexible contextualization and compositional language priors of LLMs. Petroni et al. revealed that while LMs store factual associations, they also hallucinate, motivating MKGL\u2019s strict subject\u2013relation\u2013object output format and the need to anchor predictions in an external KG. COMET demonstrated that autoregressive LMs can generate the tail entity conditioned on (head, relation), providing a direct precursor to treating triple completion as sequence generation. Building on retrieval-augmented generation, MKGL introduces real-time KG neighborhood retrieval to supply precise structural evidence at inference time, swapping unstructured passages for graph context. Finally, KnowBERT showed that enriching token representations with entity-linked knowledge improves factuality; MKGL generalizes this insight by augmenting KGL token embeddings to align the LLM\u2019s lexical space with KG entities and relations via a tailored dictionary and examples. Together, these threads converge in MKGL: a controlled three-token interface to KGs, retrieval-grounded context, and embedding augmentation that collectively yield significant gains over traditional KGE methods in KG completion while minimizing hallucinations.",
