  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core claim\u2014that scale in deep RL fails primarily due to the interaction of non-stationarity with gradient pathologies rooted in architectural choices\u2014sits at the confluence of stabilization mechanisms in RL and gradient-flow theory in deep networks. DQN established that non-stationarity is a first-order concern in deep RL and offered replay and target networks as practical stabilizers, while Sutton and Barto\u2019s deadly triad framed why off-policy bootstrapping with function approximation can diverge. Pascanu et al. grounded the gradient side of the story, diagnosing exploding/vanishing gradients and advocating clipping\u2014techniques that RL widely adopted but that alone don\u2019t ensure stable scaling.\n\nOn the architectural front, ResNets and Fixup demonstrated that gradient preservation at depth hinges on skip connections and principled initialization, even without normalization\u2014ideas that directly inform the paper\u2019s simple, RL-compatible interventions for deep and wide agents. GTrXL brought these lessons into RL, showing that normalization placement, gating, and initialization materially affect stability under non-stationary targets and long horizons. Complementing these, PopArt addressed shifting target scales via online normalization, exemplifying how keeping gradient magnitudes well-conditioned counteracts non-stationarity.\n\nTogether, these works crystallize a blueprint: diagnose instability as gradient-flow failure under moving targets, then fix it with architecture-aware initialization, residual pathways, selective normalization, and scale controls. The paper operationalizes this blueprint into minimal, drop-in interventions that robustly preserve gradient statistics, enabling consistent performance as network depth and width grow across standard RL algorithms.",
