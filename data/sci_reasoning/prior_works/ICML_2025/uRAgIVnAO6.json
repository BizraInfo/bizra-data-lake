  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s central advance\u2014efficient, multi-dimensional online forecasting with low bias under a polynomial number of conditioning events that may depend on both context and the predictions themselves\u2014sits at the intersection of multicalibration/multivalidity, no-regret learning, and specialist experts. Multicalibration (Hebert-Johnson et al., 2018) established that enforcing many subgroup calibration constraints yields universally useful predictions. Batch multivalid prediction and its online counterpart (Jung et al., 2021; Gupta et al., 2022) extended this idea to constraints indexed by both features and predicted values, directly informing the present work\u2019s ability to condition on events defined by the model\u2019s own outputs.\n\nThe downstream-use guarantee\u2014that any polynomial number of decision makers with heterogeneous utilities can consume a single forecast stream\u2014echoes the omnipredictor viewpoint (Gopalan et al., 2021), while the promise of diminishing swap regret at optimal rates relies on classic reductions and rates for internal/swap regret (Blum & Mansour, 2007). To deliver conditional regret on arbitrary intersecting subsequences, the algorithm leverages the specialist/sleeping-experts paradigm (Freund et al., 1997), treating each conditioning event as an expert that activates only when its condition holds. Finally, the calibration lineage (Foster & Vohra, 1998) motivates the bias/ECE objectives and rates; the paper advances this thread by giving the first efficient online multicalibration algorithm achieving O(T^{2/3}) ECE. Together, these threads yield a unified, efficient procedure that enforces rich conditioning constraints and translates them into robust guarantees for sequential decision making.",
