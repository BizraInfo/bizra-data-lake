  "synthesis_narrative": "Reinforcement-learning-based macro placement demonstrated by Mirhoseini et al. formulated sequential macro placement and trained policies against proxy costs such as wirelength and congestion, establishing a powerful paradigm but one whose rewards were decoupled from final signoff quality. Circuit Training operationalized this approach as an open-source baseline with the same proxy-driven objective and costly, infrequent feedback from downstream tools. In parallel, MaskPlace introduced dynamic action masking to prune spatial choices during macro placement, proving that a learned mask can dramatically stabilize learning and speed the search without sacrificing quality. Outside direct optimization, RouteNet showed that routing congestion\u2014a downstream, cross-stage outcome\u2014can be predicted accurately from early placement features using learned models, providing rapid, differentiable feedback in lieu of full routing. Similarly, deep-learning-based DRC hotspot prediction demonstrated that high-cost signoff metrics can be approximated from early-stage layouts to inform design decisions. AutoDMP further underscored the community\u2019s reliance on differentiable or heuristic proxies (HPWL/density) for efficiency, while still lacking direct optimization of final timing or manufacturability.\nTogether, these works revealed a gap: strong search procedures and masking exist, but they are guided by proxy objectives that can misalign with timing and other cross-stage metrics; meanwhile, learned surrogates can accurately approximate expensive downstream outcomes. LaMPlace synthesizes these insights by training an offline predictor for cross-stage metrics and using it online to drive a learned spatial mask, thus constraining macro placement toward regions that improve predicted timing and signoff quality while retaining the efficiency benefits of masked search.",
