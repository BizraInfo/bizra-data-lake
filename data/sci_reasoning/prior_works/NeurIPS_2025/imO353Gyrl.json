  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core idea\u2014turning a zero-shot, scale-invariant diffusion depth model into a metric predictor by injecting defocus cues at inference\u2014sits at the intersection of modern generative priors and classical shape-from-defocus physics. Marigold provides the immediate baseline: a pre-trained diffusion model that predicts zero-shot, scale-invariant monocular depth but lacks metric scale. Foundational works on defocus, epitomized by Favaro and Soatto, formalized the thin-lens image formation linking blur to depth, aperture, and focus. This physical relationship directly becomes the differentiable loss the authors use to optimize both Marigold\u2019s global scale and its diffusion latents. \n\nThe broader zero-shot MDE lineage from MiDaS defined the cross-dataset, training-free robustness regime, while ZoeDepth crystallized the remaining limitations\u2014scale ambiguity and OOD degradation\u2014explicitly motivating the need for additional physical cues. On the generative inference side, Diffusion Posterior Sampling established how to inject measurement-consistency gradients from a forward model into diffusion sampling; the authors extend this idea to a defocus-blur likelihood and to optimizing Marigold\u2019s noise latents and scale at test time. Finally, prior demonstrations that defocus can yield metric depth in practical cameras\u2014via coded apertures (Levin et al.) and dual-pixel phase-defocus cues (Wadhwa et al.)\u2014inform the paper\u2019s hardware-light design choice: capture a small/large aperture pair from the same viewpoint and use it as a physics-based constraint that resolves metric scale without any retraining.",
