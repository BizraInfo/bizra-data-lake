  "synthesis_narrative": "Adaptive Learn-then-Test (aLTT) builds squarely on the learn-then-test (LTT) paradigm for post-hoc model and hyperparameter selection under finite-sample population-risk guarantees. The core LTT idea\u2014pose selection as multiple hypothesis tests that ensure the chosen configuration meets a target risk\u2014traces back to conformal risk control (CRC), which formalized risk control via fixed-sample, p-value\u2013based testing. aLTT\u2019s key advance is to make this testing sequential, data-dependent, and early-stoppable without sacrificing validity. That advance is directly enabled by the e-process framework from Safe Testing and the broader anytime-valid inference literature on confidence sequences and nonnegative supermartingales, which provide the mathematical machinery to maintain error control under optional stopping and adaptivity. To scale risk control to families of hyperparameters, aLTT relies on multiple testing with e-values, drawing on results like e-BH from \u201cFalse Discovery Rate Control with E-values,\u201d which furnish combination and thresholding rules that preserve error guarantees in the e-value regime. Finally, prior p-value\u2013based online FDR methods such as SAFFRON underscore the limitations of p-values for adaptive, sequential procedures\u2014limitations aLTT explicitly addresses by adopting e-processes. Together, these works form a direct intellectual lineage: CRC and LTT define the objective and baseline procedure; Safe Testing and anytime-valid e-process theory make sequential, early-stopping tests possible; and e-value\u2013based MHT supplies the multiple-testing toolkit aLTT adapts to hyperparameter selection.",
