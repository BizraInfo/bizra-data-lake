RealNVP provides the essential split-transform-invertible paradigm and tractable Jacobians that this work retains while innovating on how and where to split: rather than partitioning raw Cartesian coordinates (which would break symmetry), the authors split along augmented dimensions and operate in learned invariant bases. Neural Spline Flows contributes the practical, expressive monotone rational\u2013quadratic spline transforms that are applied within these symmetry-respecting subspaces.\nFoundations from equivariant representation learning\u2014Tensor Field Networks and SE(3)-Transformers\u2014directly inform how to construct and learn SE(3)-equivariant/invariant features from 3D point sets via steerable/tensor bases and spherical harmonics, enabling the paper\u2019s per-layer mapping to invariant coordinate systems. EGNN further influences the use of distance-based invariants and permutation-aware computations in molecular graphs, aligning with the paper\u2019s need to respect both SE(3) and exchangeability of identical atoms. Deep Sets provides the theoretical backbone for permutation invariance, guiding the aggregation and conditioning mechanisms that avoid dependence on atom ordering. Finally, Boltzmann Generators connect the approach to the molecular modeling objective, demonstrating that invertible models can yield unbiased expectations via importance sampling\u2014capabilities preserved by the proposed equivariant coupling architecture. Together, these works culminate in a flow that is both symmetry-faithful and computationally efficient.",
