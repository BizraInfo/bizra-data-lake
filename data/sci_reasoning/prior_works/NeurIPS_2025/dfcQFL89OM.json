  "synthesis_narrative": "GSAC unifies three influential threads\u2014graph-structured scalability, causal invariance for domain generalization, and locality guarantees in networked dynamics\u2014into a single provable RL framework. From factored MDPs, Kearns\u2013Koller and Guestrin\u2013Koller\u2013Parr established that large systems can be tackled by exploiting sparse local scopes and decomposed value functions. GSAC inherits this structural prior but strengthens it by learning a sparse local causal mask, ensuring that only variables with genuine dynamical influence constitute the representation. The abstraction perspective of Li\u2013Walsh\u2013Littman provides the lens to view these masks as causal abstractions and to quantify the error induced by compressing state and domain factors. On the identification side, sparse VAR theory (Basu\u2013Michailidis) motivates provable recovery of minimal neighborhoods from time-series data, turning structural locality into a learnable and certifiable component. For performance guarantees, GSAC\u2019s k-hop value truncation bounds mirror the locality results of System Level Synthesis, transferring the idea that distant nodes have exponentially decaying influence from control design to value approximation. Finally, to achieve cross-domain generalization, GSAC aligns with IRM\u2019s invariance principle, seeking policies stable across environments, and operationalizes it with a meta actor-critic akin to PEARL\u2014inferring domain factors from a few trajectories\u2014while grounding these factors in causally identified mechanisms. Together, these works directly scaffold GSAC\u2019s core contribution: provably generalizable and scalable policy learning on large networked systems.",
