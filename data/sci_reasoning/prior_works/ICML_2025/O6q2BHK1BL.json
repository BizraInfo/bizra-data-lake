  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core idea\u2014deciding whether X causes Y under latent variables using purely local, necessary-and-sufficient criteria\u2014stands on the formal semantics of ancestral graphs and PAGs. Richardson and Spirtes (2002) introduced MAGs and m-separation for models with hidden and selection variables, establishing the representational bedrock. Building on this, Zhang (2008) provided complete, local orientation rules for PAGs, clarifying how ancestral relations can be read from edge marks\u2014insights our work refines into pair-specific, local characterizations that eliminate the need to recover the full PAG.\n\nMethodologically, the dominant practice for latent-variable causal discovery has been global structure learning via FCI (Spirtes et al., 2000) and its faster variants like RFCI (Colombo et al., 2012) and FCI+ (Claassen and Heskes, 2012). These methods motivated our contribution by exposing a gap: even when interest lies in a single causal relation, they expend effort to reconstruct an entire PAG. Our algorithms directly address this redundancy by answering the X\u2192Y query from local tests alone while retaining soundness and completeness.\n\nConceptually, the work is inspired by the trend of complete local graphical characterizations for identification tasks, exemplified by Perkovi\u0107 et al. (2018) for adjustment in MAGs/PAGs. Finally, Maathuis et al. (2009) underscored the value of pairwise, target-focused inference (IDA), reinforcing our objective to resolve specific causal relationships efficiently without global structure recovery.",
