  "synthesis_narrative": "NUPACK formalized RNA inverse design as selecting sequences that realize prescribed secondary structures, even across multiple targets, but its objective and energy model are strictly 2D and agnostic to 3D geometry and conformational variability. LEARNA showed that machine learning can automate inverse folding with strong performance, yet it too optimizes only secondary-structure satisfaction, reinforcing the community\u2019s focus on 2D targets. In contrast, Das and colleagues assembled a fixed-backbone RNA redesign benchmark from PDB structures and embedded the task within a 3D Rosetta framework, establishing a geometric, atomistic setting for evaluating sequence recovery. FARFAR2 further advanced Rosetta\u2019s 3D modeling and redesign pipeline on this benchmark, but its energy-based optimization is computationally heavy and limited by hand-tuned scoring. On the protein side, Ingraham et al. introduced autoregressive graph-based generation conditioned on 3D backbones, proving that local geometric message passing enables accurate, fast sequence design. ProteinMPNN crystallized this insight with a simple locality-biased kNN graph and order-agnostic decoding that achieved state-of-the-art protein recovery with remarkable speed. Together these works exposed a clear opportunity: RNA design needed to move beyond 2D objectives to 3D backbone-conditioning, while inheriting the speed and accuracy of protein-structure-conditioned generative GNNs. By transplanting and extending backbone-conditioned message passing and autoregressive decoding from protein design to RNA\u2014and by aggregating information across multiple backbone conformations\u2014gRNAde naturally fills the gap between 2D inverse folding tools and slow energy-based 3D pipelines, enabling fast, accurate, and explicitly multi-state RNA sequence design.",

    "abstract": "Computational RNA design tasks are often posed as inverse problems, where sequences are designed based on adopting a single desired secondary structure without considering 3D conformational diversity. We introduce gRNAde, a geometric RNA design pipeline operating on 3D RNA backbones to design sequences that explicitly account for structure and dynamics. gRNAde uses a multi-state Graph Neural Network and autoregressive decoding to generates candidate RNA sequences conditioned on one or more 3D backbone structures where the identities of the bases are unknown. On a single-state fixed backbone re-design benchmark of 14 RNA structures from the PDB identified by Das et al. (2010), gRNAde obtains higher native sequence recovery rates (56% on average) compared to Rosetta (45% on average), taking under a second to produce designs compared to the reported hours for Rosetta. We further demonstrate the utility of gRNAde on a new benchmark of multi-state design for structurally flexible RNAs, as w",
