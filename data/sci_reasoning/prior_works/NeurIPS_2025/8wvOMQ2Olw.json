  "synthesis_narrative": "GraLoRA\u2019s core contribution\u2014partitioning each weight matrix into sub-blocks with independent low-rank adapters\u2014emerges from a line of work grappling with LoRA\u2019s capacity\u2013stability trade-offs and gradient interference. LoRA introduced the central low-rank reparameterization that GraLoRA retains, but it also revealed a structural bottleneck: as rank grows, updates entangle gradients across unrelated input channels, often stalling or harming accuracy compared to full fine-tuning. Subsequent methods tried to unlock capacity without losing stability. AdaLoRA redistributed rank across layers, highlighting that na\u00efvely increasing rank is ineffective, while PiSSA aligned LoRA with principal subspaces to better utilize higher ranks and narrow the FFT gap. DoRA reframed the problem as weight entanglement, decomposing magnitude and direction to stabilize optimization.\n\nComplementary to these efforts, IA3 showed that localized, channel-wise modulation can reduce interference, and Compacter demonstrated that carefully structured adapters (e.g., via Kronecker designs and parameter sharing) can expand expressivity at negligible cost. GraLoRA synthesizes these insights: rather than only tuning where/what subspace to update, it restructures how updates propagate by spatially localizing adapters within sub-blocks of the weight matrix. This granular design decouples gradients across channels, scales capacity effectively with minimal overhead, and empirically recovers FFT-like behavior at higher ranks\u2014addressing the very failure mode that prior LoRA variants mitigated only partially through rank scheduling, decomposition, or initialization.",
