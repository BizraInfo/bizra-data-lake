  "synthesis_narrative": "FAIR\u2019s core innovation\u2014a full-atom, ligand-conditioned iterative refinement framework that co-designs pocket sequence and 3D structure\u2014sits at the intersection of three lines of prior work. First, classical de novo pocket design with Rosetta (Tinberg et al., 2013) defined the challenge of shaping cavities and packing sidechains around small molecules, establishing the need for accurate full-atom modeling. Second, the fixed-backbone inverse folding successes of ProteinMPNN (Dauparas et al., 2022) demonstrated that learned sequence design on given backbones is highly effective but lacks structural adaptability and ligand context; FAIR removes this constraint by jointly updating sequence and backbone in the presence of the ligand. Third, recent advances in structure prediction and generative modeling introduced iterative, geometry-aware refinement: AlphaFold2 (Jumper et al., 2021) validated iterative recycling and full-atom outputs, while RFdiffusion (Watson et al., 2023) showed that denoising-style refinement can generate functional proteins and scaffold sites. In parallel, SE(3)-equivariant architectures (SE(3)-Transformer; Fuchs et al., 2020) and equivariant diffusion for 3D molecules (Hoogeboom et al., 2022) provided the principled machinery to update coordinates consistently under rigid motions. DiffDock (Corso et al., 2023) specifically demonstrated that ligand\u2013protein geometry can be captured by equivariant diffusion, motivating FAIR\u2019s ligand-aware context modeling. Integrating these strands, FAIR adopts a coarse-to-fine, full-shot refinement strategy\u2014from backbone to sidechains\u2014that unifies sequence-structure co-design with explicit ligand conditioning, achieving efficient, end-to-end full-atom pocket generation.",
