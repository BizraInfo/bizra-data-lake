  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014size-invariant evaluation and training for multi-object SOD\u2014emerges from a direct reassessment of the community\u2019s established evaluation protocol. Borji et al. (2015) codified SOD benchmarking around pixel-aggregated measures (e.g., F-measure, MAE), which shaped how progress has been reported. Subsequent metrics aimed to better align with human perception\u2014Margolin et al.\u2019s weighted F-measure, Fan et al.\u2019s S-measure, and E-measure\u2014but all still aggregate over pixels and thus intrinsically overweight large objects, a limitation this work pinpoints and corrects. The key conceptual pivot\u2014evaluating each salient object separately and then aggregating\u2014draws clear inspiration from instance-aware evaluation in segmentation, exemplified by Panoptic Segmentation (Kirillov et al.), where instances contribute more equally, mitigating size bias. Having redefined the target metric, the authors then face the classic challenge of optimizing non-decomposable objectives. Here, they extend the Lovasz-Softmax principle\u2014designing differentiable surrogates for set-based metrics\u2014to their proposed size-invariant SOD measures, yielding a training loss aligned with the new evaluation. Taken together, these prior works directly define the baseline evaluation landscape, expose the gap (size sensitivity), provide the instance-centric inspiration, and supply the methodological blueprint for metric-aligned optimization, culminating in the paper\u2019s size-invariant metrics and tailored loss for imbalanced multi-object SOD.",
