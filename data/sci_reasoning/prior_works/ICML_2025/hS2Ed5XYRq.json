  "synthesis_narrative": "MapEval\u2019s core innovation is a comprehensive, map-centric evaluation that unifies textual, API-based, and visual reasoning for geospatial tasks. This builds on two intellectual lines. First, GeoQuery established the foundational problem of geographic question answering over structured data, while subsequent navigation work\u2014particularly R2R and Touchdown\u2014framed natural language spatial reasoning and route following in real environments. However, those benchmarks either constrain the interaction to static visual scenes or closed databases, leaving out real map tools and modern LLM capabilities. Second, recent advances in tool-augmented LLMs\u2014Toolformer, ReAct, and Gorilla\u2014demonstrated that models can interleave reasoning with tool use and select appropriate APIs with correct arguments. MapEval directly transposes these ideas to the geospatial domain by designing tasks that demand long-context planning, correct API selection and parameterization (e.g., routing, places, distances), and visual map interpretation across diverse cities worldwide. In doing so, it explicitly addresses the gaps in prior spatial benchmarks (limited scope, no real API interaction) and in generic tool-use evaluations (domain-agnostic, lacking geospatial complexity and map visual context). The result is an evaluation suite that reveals persistent weaknesses in state-of-the-art foundation models when faced with real-world map reasoning, highlighting the need for methods that jointly master reasoning, tool use, and visual understanding in geographic contexts.",
