  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution\u2014extending triple differences to the changes-in-changes paradigm\u2014rests on unifying two influential strands. First, Athey and Imbens (2006) established the CiC framework, showing how monotone rank mappings can nonparametrically identify entire counterfactual outcome distributions in a DID setting. This provides the conceptual and technical backbone for moving beyond mean effects under parallel trends toward distributional identification. Second, Gruber (1994) popularized the triple-difference design as a practical way to relax DID\u2019s parallel trends assumption by using an additional, unaffected margin. Meyer (1995) further codified DDD within the design-based causal inference toolkit, motivating its use when conventional DID credibility is strained.\nAbadie (2005) advanced semiparametric DID identification, reinforcing the value of minimal functional form assumptions\u2014an ethos mirrored in this paper\u2019s nonparametric distributional identification for DDD. Meanwhile, Bitler, Gelbach, and Hoynes (2006) demonstrated empirically that policy evaluations focused on averages can miss meaningful heterogeneity, providing direct impetus to develop distributional DDD methods that recover full counterfactual distributions. Finally, Callaway and Li (2023) supplied a parallel, quantile-DID route to distributional effects under conditional parallel trends; the present work complements this by adopting CiC-style assumptions and elevating them to a triple-difference design suited for targeted policies. Together, these works directly shape the Triple Changes estimator\u2019s identification strategy and its motivation to deliver distributional policy effects where traditional DID/DDD fall short.",
