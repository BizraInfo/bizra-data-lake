  "synthesis_narrative": "Pocket-conditioned generative modeling emerged with methods like Pocket2Mol, which directly synthesize ligands using graph-based generation constrained by the 3D geometry and chemistry of a protein pocket, but with bespoke data handling and metrics. In parallel, pose-prediction methods such as DiffDock and EquiBind framed protein\u2013ligand complexes geometrically, using SE(3)-aware diffusion or geometric matching on interaction graphs to place ligands in pockets; these works reinforced treating complexes as structured graphs that span protein and ligand components. Benchmarking in molecular generation was professionalized by GuacaMol, which demonstrated how standardized tasks, metrics, and modular implementations yield fair, reproducible comparisons\u2014though its scope excluded protein-structure conditioning. Foundational datasets like PDBbind provided curated protein\u2013ligand complexes with binding affinities, while CrossDocked2020 scaled pocket-centered complex data and rigorous splits for docking and pose tasks. Independently, DeLinker established a concrete \u201cfill-in-the-blank\u201d generative paradigm by completing missing molecular segments in 3D, proving that graph completion can be a natural generative interface. Together, these works expose a gap: SBDD methods operate on similar protein\u2013ligand graphs yet remain fragmented across tasks, datasets, and implementations, hampering comparability. The natural next step is to unify them by casting target-aware drug design as complex binding graph completion, standardizing data protocols from PDBbind/CrossDocked, and integrating pocket-conditioned generation (Pocket2Mol) and pose baselines (DiffDock/EquiBind) within a modular, extensible benchmark that spans multiple sub-tasks.",

    "abstract": "Structure-based drug design (SBDD) aims to generate potential drugs that can bind to a target protein and is greatly expedited by the aid of AI techniques in generative models. However, a lack of systematic understanding persists due to the diverse settings, complex implementation, difficult reproducibility, and task singularity. Firstly, the absence of standardization can lead to unfair comparisons and inconclusive insights. To address this dilemma, we propose CBGBench, a comprehensive benchmark for SBDD, that unifies the task as a generative graph completion, analogous to fill-in-the-blank of the 3D complex binding graph. By categorizing existing methods based on their attributes, CBGBench facilitates a modular and extensible framework that implements cutting-edge methods. Secondly, a single de novo molecule generation task can hardly reflect their capabilities. To broaden the scope, we adapt these models to a range of tasks essential in drug design, considered sub-tasks within the g",
