  "synthesis_narrative": "Pick-to-Learn (P2L) is rooted in the classical insight that compressibility drives generalization. Floyd and Warmuth formalized this link by showing that if a learner can represent its decision using a small subset of the training sample (plus side information), test error is controlled by the compression size. Moran and Yehudayoff\u2019s breakthrough broadened the scope by establishing general compression schemes for VC classes, cementing compression as a broadly applicable mechanism rather than a peculiarity of specific algorithms. In parallel, Arora et al. demonstrated the practical power of compression by obtaining tight, data-dependent bounds for deep networks via post hoc compression, suggesting that compressibility is a fruitful lens for modern overparameterized models.\n\nP2L\u2019s distinctive move is to engineer compressibility during learning by embedding any base learner in a meta-algorithm that selects informative subsets\u2014an idea that echoes the scenario approach of Campi and Garatti. Their theory shows that a handful of support constraints governs out-of-sample feasibility, effectively a compression set whose size yields tight probabilistic guarantees; their later synthesis provides concrete procedures to identify such supports and compute bounds. P2L unifies these strands, turning Occam\u2019s principle into an actionable training protocol: it picks (compresses) to learn, rather than learning and then compressing. This produces tight, distribution-free bounds competitive with test-set and PAC-Bayes approaches, while the targeted compressibility also improves post-training performance on tasks like MNIST and synthetic regression.",
