  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of this paper is to formalize and quantify what flatness/minima-stability can (and crucially cannot) guarantee for two-layer ReLU networks with multivariate inputs. The conceptual bridge that flatness implies generalization traces to PAC-Bayesian analyses and empirical evidence: Dziugaite and Roy showed that perturbation-stable (flat) solutions admit nonvacuous generalization bounds, and Foret et al. operationalized flatness via sharpness-aware minimization. These works created the prevailing narrative that flatter solutions generalize better. The present paper squarely addresses the missing piece: how this narrative scales with input dimension. By deriving upper and lower bounds for generalization gaps and nonparametric MSE at stable minima, it proves that flatness-based guarantees necessarily degrade exponentially in dimension.\nIn parallel, the paper grounds its contrast class in the classic norm-controlled theory of shallow networks. Barron\u2019s seminal result and Bach\u2019s convex neural networks establish dimension-insensitive statistical rates under low-norm control (a proxy for weight decay). Neyshabur et al. further systematized norm-based capacity control. Using these as baselines, the authors prove an exponential separation: flat/stable minima suffer a curse of dimensionality, while low-norm solutions do not. Finally, prior implicit-bias theory such as Soudry et al. primarily addressed interpolation/separable regimes; by targeting stable minima beyond interpolation and moving from univariate to multivariate inputs, this work fills a central theoretical gap and reframes when flatness is\u2014and is not\u2014a reliable predictor of generalization.",
