  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014using causal mediation analysis to reveal the circuit-level mechanisms by which LLMs perform propositional logic\u2014rests on two intertwined lines of prior work: transformer-circuits methodology and causal intervention frameworks. The transformer-circuits program (Elhage et al., 2021) provided the conceptual and methodological foundation for treating LLM computations as modular circuits composed of attention heads and MLPs. Building on this, Olsson et al. (2022) established concrete head-level functions (induction heads) and a layerwise division of labor, suggesting that complex reasoning can be decomposed into sequential, specialized steps. The IOI circuit analysis further demonstrated end-to-end circuit discovery using activation patching and path tracing, directly informing the present paper\u2019s approach to isolating the specific heads and connections that mediate A \u21d2 B reasoning.\n\nComplementing circuit discovery, causal mediation techniques from Vig et al. (2020) provide a principled way to quantify how internal pathways transmit information. The current work extends this mediation framework from bias attribution and smaller models to large decoder-only LLMs (Mistral, Gemma), applying it to reasoning pathways and validating causal roles of components. ROME (Meng et al., 2022) reinforces the importance of causal localization and targeted interventions, which the authors leverage to identify where logical facts are stored and combined. Finally, insights from mechanistic studies of algorithmic tasks and grokking (Nanda et al., 2023) motivate the paper\u2019s thesis that propositional reasoning emerges as modular sub-computations distributed across heads and layers, enabling fine-grained functional attributions across model depth.",
