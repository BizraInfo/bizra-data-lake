  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014a Cheeger-type inequality and efficient algorithm for constrained clustering formulated as a cut ratio between two graphs G and H\u2014sits at the intersection of spectral partitioning, signed graphs, and general-demand cut objectives. Foundationally, Chung\u2019s spectral graph theory and Cheeger inequality establish the link between discrete cuts and Laplacian eigenvalues, which our work extends from a single graph to a two-graph setting. On the algorithmic side, the ratio-cut lineage from Hagen and Kahng and the normalized-cut framework of Shi and Malik show how ratio objectives reduce to generalized eigenvalue problems; we adapt this insight to L_G x = \u03bb L_H x to target the G-vs-H cut ratio directly.\n\nCrucially, we leverage signed graph methodology\u2014particularly Kunegis et al.\u2019s signed Laplacian\u2014to encode must-link/cannot-link information in H while preserving a well-structured, positive semidefinite operator that enables efficient spectral computation. Prior constrained spectral clustering work by Rangapuram and Hein demonstrates the value and feasibility of integrating pairwise constraints into spectral objectives, which we generalize while providing a Cheeger-type performance guarantee. Finally, the general-demand perspective of Linial\u2013London\u2013Rabinovich frames our objective as a sparsest-cut-like ratio between capacity (G) and demand (H), justifying the two-graph formulation. Von Luxburg\u2019s tutorial informs our relaxation and rounding pipeline. Together, these works directly motivate our generalized eigenvalue approach and theoretical guarantee, and they underwrite the choice of the signed Laplacian to achieve both computational efficiency and constraint fidelity.",
