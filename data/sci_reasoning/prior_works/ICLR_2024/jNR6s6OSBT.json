  "synthesis_narrative": "SimOpt showed that the gap between simulation and reality can be reduced by iteratively adapting domain randomization distributions using real-world feedback, but its data collection remained task-driven and passive, depending on Bayesian optimization over parameter distributions matched to task outcomes. Dynamics randomization work demonstrated that robust control and online system identification could be achieved by conditioning policies on latent dynamics and inferring them from rollouts, formalizing the goal of estimating hidden physical parameters for transfer. BayesSim introduced likelihood-free inference to recover posteriors over simulator parameters from real trajectories, establishing a general recipe for simulator parameter identification without requiring analytic likelihoods. Data-efficient domain randomization with Bayesian optimization further emphasized tuning parameter distributions from limited real trials, yet it also relied on passively obtained task executions rather than explicitly informative experiments. Plan2Explore advanced the idea of planning to reduce model uncertainty\u2014using disagreement or information-theoretic objectives\u2014showing the power of targeted exploration when the objective is epistemic uncertainty reduction. Active information acquisition framed mutual-information objectives for experiment design in robotics, offering formal criteria for selecting actions that maximally reduce parameter uncertainty.\nTogether, these works revealed a gap: while parameter inference and distribution adaptation were feasible, the data used to do so was not purposefully chosen to identify dynamics. The natural next step was to fuse posterior-based system identification with information-theoretic planning, yielding an exploration policy that selects manipulation interactions explicitly to disambiguate simulator parameters, thereby enabling more accurate sim refinement and stronger sim-to-real transfer from a small amount of real data.",

    "abstract": "Model-free control strategies such as reinforcement learning have shown the ability to learn control strategies without requiring an accurate model or simulator of the world. While this is appealing due to the lack of modeling requirements, such methods can be sample inefficient, making them impractical in many real-world domains. On the other hand, model-based control techniques leveraging accurate simulators can circumvent these challenges and use a large amount of cheap simulation data to learn controllers that can effectively transfer to the real world. The challenge with such model-based techniques is the requirement for an extremely accurate simulation, requiring both the specification of appropriate simulation assets and physical parameters. This requires considerable human effort to design for every environment being considered. In this work, we propose a learning system that can leverage a small amount of real-world data to autonomously refine a simulation model and then plan ",
