  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper addresses a long-standing gap between empirical convergence guarantees of no-regret learning and the actual evolution of players\u2019 strategies. Hart and Mas-Colell established that no-external-regret learning drives time-averaged play to (coarse) correlated equilibrium, but this says little about day-to-day strategies. To study pathwise behavior, the authors rely on the stochastic-approximation and differential-inclusion toolkit of Bena\u00efm\u2013Hofbauer\u2013Sorin, which allows discrete regularized algorithms (e.g., FTRL/mirror descent) to be analyzed via continuous-time dynamics and their invariant/attractor sets. On the dynamical side, Hofbauer\u2013Sandholm showed that under broad payoff-monotonic/regularized dynamics, only strict Nash equilibria can be asymptotically stable\u2014highlighting the limitations of pointwise equilibrium predictions and motivating a move to setwise notions. Building on the continuous-time regularized learning framework and Bregman Lyapunov structure developed by Mertikopoulos\u2013Sandholm, the paper characterizes attractors of regularized learning dynamics. On the strategic side, it draws on the setwise perspective of Kohlberg\u2013Mertens\u2019 strategic stability and the CURB-set rationale of Basu\u2013Weibull, where sets are judged by their robustness to unilateral deviations. Finally, the entropic lens of McKelvey\u2013Palfrey\u2019s quantal response connects regularization to a quantifiable cost of deviating, aligning dynamic stability under regularized learning with a stringent setwise strategic criterion. Together, these strands enable the central result: dynamically stable sets of regularized learning trajectories coincide with strategically stable sets, thereby unifying dynamic and strategic stability in repeated play.",
