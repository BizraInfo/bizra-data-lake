  "synthesis_narrative": "UEO\u2019s core innovation\u2014confidence-driven universal entropy optimization for realistic unsupervised CLIP fine-tuning\u2014emerges from unifying two lines of prior work. First, information-theoretic training with unlabeled data: Grandvalet and Bengio established conditional entropy minimization as a driver for confident predictions, while SHOT operationalized information maximization in practice by coupling conditional entropy minimization with prediction diversity (marginal entropy maximization). Second, handling unlabeled data with unknown classes: Universal/Open-set formulations (You et al.) and open-set semi-supervised learning (OpenMatch) demonstrated that treating confident and ambiguous samples differently is crucial when unknown categories contaminate the unlabeled set. UEO synthesizes these ideas within CLIP\u2019s vision\u2013language framework (Radford et al.), using sample-level confidence as the switch: minimize conditional entropy on confident samples to sharpen recognition of known classes, but maximize marginal entropy on less-confident ones to avoid collapsing onto spurious known labels and thereby improve OOD detection.\n\nPractically, UEO also addresses limitations of pure entropy-minimization adaptation (e.g., Tent), which tends to overfit unknown data, by explicitly regularizing predictions toward higher marginal entropy when confidence is low. The confidence-driven mechanism echoes FixMatch\u2019s selective use of unlabeled data, but is adapted to a universal setting where unknowns are expected. By embedding this principled treatment into CLIP\u2019s prompt-based classification, UEO yields a simple, efficient approach that simultaneously enhances known-class recognition and OOD detection without relying on label-associated class-name priors.",
