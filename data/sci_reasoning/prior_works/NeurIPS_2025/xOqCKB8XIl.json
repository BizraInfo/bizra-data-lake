  "synthesis_narrative": "HopaDIFF\u2019s core innovation\u2014holistic\u2013partial aware, Fourier-conditioned diffusion for referring human action segmentation\u2014emerges from the confluence of advances in diffusion-based structured prediction, temporal modeling for segmentation, and multimodal grounding. At its heart, the model reinterprets action segmentation as conditional denoising over label sequences, directly inheriting the iterative refinement mechanics of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models. To precisely encode temporal positions and sharpen boundaries in long, untrimmed videos, it conditions the diffusion process on Fourier feature mappings, following the insight that Fourier encodings capture high-frequency signal components crucial for change points.\n\nOn the segmentation side, the formulation and training recipes of framewise action parsing are rooted in Temporal Convolutional Networks and the multi-stage refinement of MS-TCN; HopaDIFF generalizes these iterative refinements through probabilistic denoising steps that better handle over-segmentation and boundary jitter. Because the task is multi-person and text-referred, the model must isolate the target individual while leveraging scene context. Actor-conditioned context modeling from the Video Action Transformer informs HopaDIFF\u2019s holistic\u2013partial design, fusing target-centric tracks with global cues to disambiguate interactions and occlusions. Finally, robust text-video alignment is essential: CLIP\u2019s language\u2013vision pretraining provides the semantic bridge enabling the textual description to guide per-person segmentation. The broader paradigm of text-guided temporal grounding, pioneered by moment retrieval, underpins HopaDIFF\u2019s extension from coarse segment retrieval to dense, per-frame labeling under natural language references.",
