  "synthesis_narrative": "ConforMix\u2019s central idea\u2014retrofitting diffusion models at inference time to uncover biomolecular conformational landscapes\u2014sits at the intersection of diffusion guidance, molecular structure generation, and thermodynamic reweighting. The method inherits its generative backbone from DDPM and the continuous-time SDE perspective, which together define how scores and stepwise denoising can be perturbed during sampling. Building on this foundation, ConforMix adopts classifier-driven steering pioneered by Dhariwal and Nichol and the classifier-free alternative of Ho and Salimans to bias trajectories toward diverse, biophysically plausible conformations without retraining. In molecular settings, DiffDock provided a concrete blueprint for coupling diffusion sampling with an inference-time confidence model to filter candidates; ConforMix generalizes this idea from docking poses to conformational ensembles by learning to score and cull trajectories that violate geometric or energetic plausibility.\n\nCrucially, ConforMix integrates free energy estimation akin to Boltzmann Generators, using generative samples with principled reweighting to approximate equilibrium populations across discovered conformational states. This thermodynamic lens both prioritizes low-free-energy regions and enables quantitative comparisons among sampled states. Finally, the approach targets protein-structure diffusion models originally trained for static backbones\u2014exemplified by RFdiffusion\u2014demonstrating that inference-time guidance, filtering, and reweighting can unlock hidden variability without altering pretraining or specifying collective variables. Together, these works enable ConforMix\u2019s orthogonal, plug-in upgrade: steer diffusion paths toward conformational diversity, filter to maintain physical realism, and reweight to recover free-energy-consistent ensembles.",
