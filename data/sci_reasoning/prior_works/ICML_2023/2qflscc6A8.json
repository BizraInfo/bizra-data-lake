  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014learning SDFs directly from noisy point clouds via a noise-to-noise mapping\u2014stands on two intertwined intellectual threads: self-supervised denoising and neural implicit surface learning. Noise2Noise established that pairs of independent noisy measurements suffice to learn a denoiser without clean targets, a principle this work transfers to 3D geometry by treating multiple LiDAR scans as independent noisy observations of the same underlying SDF. Noise2Self further motivates the feasibility of self-supervision from a single noisy observation, informing the paper\u2019s single-scan regime by emphasizing statistical independence structures that prevent identity solutions.\n\nOn the representation side, DeepSDF introduced neural SDFs as a continuous implicit surface model, which this paper retains while discarding its reliance on clean signed distance supervision. SAL and IGR advanced training SDFs from raw point samples through sign-agnostic constraints and Eikonal regularization; however, SAL\u2019s dependence on clean on-surface constraints and normals, and the general sensitivity of these pipelines to noise, expose the precise gap this paper targets. The proposed loss statistically aggregates over unordered, correspondence-free scans to maintain geometric consistency\u2014complementing IGR-style SDF regularization\u2014thus enabling learning without clean SDFs, normals, or denoised inputs. Relative to Points2Surf, a strong implicit-surface baseline trained on cleaner supervision, the new method reframes supervision entirely around noisy observations, achieving robustness aligned with realistic LiDAR data acquisition.",
