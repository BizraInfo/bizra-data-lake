  "synthesis_narrative": "PoE-World\u2019s central idea\u2014representing a world model as an exponentially weighted product of programmatic experts synthesized by LLMs\u2014arises from the confluence of two lines of work: multiplicative composition of experts and program-structured, data-efficient generative modeling. On the compositional side, Hinton\u2019s Products of Experts provides the core mathematical principle for combining partial, constraint-imposing models by multiplying their densities, while the Bayesian Committee Machine shows how precision-weighted multiplicative fusion of heterogeneous experts yields robustness and data efficiency. PoE-World operationalizes these ideas by learning weights and employing executable code experts that factor different aspects of the environment.\nOn the modeling side, Bayesian Program Learning and DreamCoder established that representing knowledge as programs affords strong generalization from sparse data and compositional reuse\u2014crucial for world modeling with limited observations. AI Feynman reinforced the value of interpretable, symbolic dynamics discovery, inspiring PoE-World\u2019s focus on programmatic explanations beyond gridworlds and closed-form equations to complex, stochastic domains. The practicality of synthesizing such experts is underwritten by recent evidence that LLMs can produce modular, executable controllers, as in Code as Policies; PoE-World repurposes this capability to generate expert simulators. Finally, building upon the model-based planning paradigm introduced by deep World Models, PoE-World embeds its compositional, programmatic world model into a planner, achieving the same downstream utility while addressing the sample inefficiency of purely neural approaches.",
