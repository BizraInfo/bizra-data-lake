  "synthesis_narrative": "The Differential Transformer grows out of two intertwined lines of work: (1) core Transformer attention and its empirical shortcomings with distractors, and (2) methods that promote sparsity to focus attention. Vaswani et al. (2017) provide the baseline attention mechanism and training paradigm that Diff Transformer modifies at the heart of the model. Martins and Astudillo (2016) and Correia et al. (2019) established that replacing softmax with sparse alternatives (sparsemax/entmax) can yield more selective, interpretable attention, motivating the pursuit of mechanisms that sharpen focus. However, long-context architectures such as Longformer (Beltagy et al., 2020) and BigBird (Zaheer et al., 2020) largely rely on predefined sparse patterns; they scale sequence length but do not directly address the semantic problem of irrelevant context overwhelming relevant evidence. Liu et al. (2023) made this failure mode explicit with Lost in the Middle, showing that LMs often miss key information surrounded by distractors. Diff Transformer targets this precise gap by constructing attention as the difference of two softmax maps, explicitly canceling noise and allowing sparse patterns to emerge without hand-crafted layouts or non-standard normalizers. Beyond accuracy, Dettmers et al. (2022) highlight activation outliers as a practical issue; Diff Transformer\u2019s subtractive scoring naturally dampens extremes, contributing to better quantization and stability. Taken together, these works shaped Diff Transformer\u2019s core idea: retain the Transformer scaffold while inducing selective, noise-canceling attention that tackles distractor sensitivity and long-context utility head-on.",
