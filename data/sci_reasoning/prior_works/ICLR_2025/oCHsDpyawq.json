  "synthesis_narrative": "ZAPBench\u2019s core innovation\u2014framing cellular-resolution whole-brain neural activity prediction as a standardized benchmark\u2014stands on two intertwined lineages. First, foundational zebrafish imaging advances by Ahrens et al. and Vladimirov et al. made it technically possible to record near-comprehensive neural activity with light-sheet microscopy, including during behavior. These works defined the acquisition regime and stabilized volumetric data characteristics that ZAPBench now formalizes into a reproducible forecasting task with motion-stabilized, voxel-level segmentations.\n\nSecond, the paper draws directly from benchmarking paradigms that catalyzed progress in other fields. WeatherBench provided a blueprint for domain-focused, open forecasting benchmarks with fixed datasets, tasks, and metrics; Brain-Score demonstrated how neuroscience can accelerate via community benchmarks and leaderboards. ZAPBench fuses these ideas to create a rigorous, shared yardstick for whole-brain neural dynamics.\n\nOn the modeling side, ZAPBench\u2019s initial baselines trace to established spatiotemporal and neural-dynamics methods. ConvLSTM represents a canonical approach for video-like forecasting extended here to volumetric neural data, while LFADS exemplifies latent dynamical systems models for predicting neural activity over time. Finally, Hildebrand et al.\u2019s whole-brain EM mapping in zebrafish highlights a critical gap\u2014structural detail without paired, standardized functional forecasting\u2014which ZAPBench is poised to bridge by providing a functional benchmark from a brain undergoing synaptic-level reconstruction, enabling future structure-informed prediction.",
