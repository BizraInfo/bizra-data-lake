CLIP established the dominant image\u2013text pretraining paradigm and, crucially, the practice of using CLIP scores as a data-quality signal, which LAION-5B operationalized at web scale through automated filtering and heuristics. DataComp transformed these ideas into a retrain-and-evaluate protocol that closes the loop between curation strategies and downstream transfer, directly mirroring the sandbox\u2019s probe-then-refine design.\n\nOn the model side, LLaVA demonstrated that model improvements hinge on the data pipeline\u2014synthetic, model-guided multimodal instructions\u2014exemplifying the tight coupling the sandbox seeks to generalize across tasks. For generative video, DiT provides a unifying transformer-diffusion backbone that the suite targets, enabling standardized probing and ablations in text-to-video setups.\n\nFinally, the sandbox\u2019s feedback ethos is grounded in interactive evaluation and data quality diagnostics. Dynabench pioneered adversarial, human/model-in-the-loop benchmarking to iteratively stress-test systems and expand datasets, a template for the sandbox\u2019s probing and guided refinement. Complementing this, Confident Learning contributes concrete analytic tools to uncover and correct noisy or mislabeled data, strengthening the Analyze\u2013Refine steps. Together, these works supply the methodological, algorithmic, and evaluative foundations that the Data-Juicer Sandbox integrates into a practical, cost-effective suite for multimodal data\u2013model co-development.",
