  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014a mechanism for collaborative normal mean estimation that both elicits truthful reports and induces sufficient costly data collection\u2014arises at the intersection of peer-based elicitation and classical minimax estimation. Foundationally, Prelec\u2019s Bayesian Truth Serum and Miller\u2013Resnick\u2013Zeckhauser\u2019s Peer Prediction demonstrate how to incentivize honesty without verification by rewarding agreement with peers. This paper translates that agreement principle into the statistical-estimation setting by degrading (corrupting) the data an agent receives from others in proportion to how their own report deviates from peer reports, a continuous analogue of agreement scoring that makes misreporting and under-collection unprofitable. Robust developments in peer prediction\u2014Witkowski\u2013Parkes\u2019 elimination of strong common-prior assumptions and Radanovic\u2013Faltings\u2019 adjustment for chance agreement\u2014inform the design\u2019s resilience: it relies on distributional structure and peer predictability rather than detailed shared priors, and it scales penalties relative to expected deviations, neutralizing gains from fabrication. Crucially, the mechanism addresses endogenous effort, drawing on Dasgupta\u2013Ghosh\u2019s modeling of costly proficiency: here, effort corresponds to sample collection, and the corruption rule aligns incentives so that collecting more truthful samples strictly improves one\u2019s own estimate quality. Finally, the paper\u2019s minimax-optimality claims are anchored in classical normal-mean theory (Lehmann\u2013Casella), which provides the baseline risk and tools to tune corruption levels and prove optimality. Together, these strands directly shape a mechanism that transforms a public-good data-sharing problem into an excludable, incentive-aligned collaboration with provable optimality.",
