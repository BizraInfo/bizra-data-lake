  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core advance\u2014an improved upper bound on the maximum posterior variance for Gaussian processes that sharpens the dependence on noise variance\u2014sits squarely within the classical GP bandit framework introduced by Srinivas et al., who tied cumulative regret to information gain via log-determinant and variance-sum arguments. Valko et al. then instantiated RKHS-based confidence and regret analyses for kernelized bandits, crystallizing the dependence on the RKHS norm that this paper ultimately makes optimal. Chowdhury and Gopalan advanced the concentration machinery for RKHS functions and delivered improved GP-UCB/TS bounds, but their analyses still inherited suboptimal noise dependence from the standard variance control; this explicit gap is precisely what the present work closes by proving a tighter maximum posterior variance bound.\n\nOn the algorithmic side, Contal et al. established the phased-elimination (pure exploration) paradigm for GP bandits and analyzed its variance-reduction behavior. The current paper re-analyzes PE\u2014and the classic maximum-variance-reduction (MVR) heuristic whose roots trace to Cohn et al.\u2019s active learning principle of sampling by high predictive variance\u2014under the new variance bound, yielding nearly optimal regret in the noiseless case and optimal dependence on the RKHS norm. Finally, the information-theoretic lower bounds of Scarlett et al. delineate the achievable rates; the new results align with these benchmarks. The confidence-set backbone originating from Abbasi-Yadkori et al. underlies the regret proofs, with the paper\u2019s novelty emerging from the refined posterior-variance control that propagates through MVR and PE to deliver the claimed optimalities.",
