  "synthesis_narrative": "Operator Flow Matching (OFM) sits at the intersection of operator learning and modern flow-based generative modeling for stochastic processes. Neural operator works such as the Fourier Neural Operator and DeepONet established how to learn mappings between function spaces and to evaluate outputs at arbitrary query points\u2014crucial capabilities that OFM inherits to model processes over general domains and to return joint predictions on any finite set. From the probabilistic side, Gaussian Processes set the gold standard for coherent stochastic process priors with exact conditioning and predictive densities, while Conditional Neural Processes introduced neural, data-driven priors over functions. OFM\u2019s key advance is to provide explicit likelihoods and Kolmogorov-consistent joint densities like GPs, but with the expressive, learned non-Gaussian structure and scalability of neural operators.\n\nTechnically, OFM builds on continuous-time transport ideas. Neural ODEs supplied the machinery for parameterizing flows and computing densities via change-of-variables, and score-based SDEs clarified the probability flow ODE viewpoint that deterministically transports distributions. Stochastic Interpolants provided the flow matching principle\u2014training by aligning conditional vector fields without solving the forward dynamics\u2014that OFM adapts to the operator setting. By marrying operator architectures with flow-matching-based training in function space, OFM learns stochastic process priors that yield tractable mean and density estimation at new points and deliver state-of-the-art performance in stochastic process learning and functional regression.",
