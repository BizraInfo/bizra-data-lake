  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014unifying measurements, constraints, and dynamics learning via a measurement-induced fiber bundle\u2014sits at the intersection of geometric control, safety certification, and neural differential equations. Bullo and Lewis established the principal fiber bundle viewpoint for constrained mechanical systems, offering the mathematical substrate to encode constraints and connections on state spaces. Building on this, symmetry-preserving observer theory (Bonnabel) articulated how output maps and symmetries naturally define homogeneous spaces and bundle structures for estimation, foreshadowing the paper\u2019s idea that sensing induces a fibered geometry over the state space.\n\nOn the safety side, Ames et al. introduced Control Barrier Functions as a tractable, composable tool for enforcing forward invariance, which the present work extends to barrier functions defined on measurement-induced bundles to adapt to local sensing. Xiao and Belta\u2019s input-to-state safety further relates safety margins to uncertainty, directly informing the new guarantees that constraint satisfaction scales with sensing quality.\n\nFor dynamics learning, Neural ODEs (Chen et al.) provide the continuous-time, differentiable backbone the method uses to fit flow fields while respecting geometric constraints. Hamiltonian Neural Networks showed the value of encoding geometric structure to preserve invariants in learned dynamics, aligning with the bundle-based constraint preservation here. Finally, PINNs (Raissi et al.) demonstrated how embedding physical constraints into training improves generalization and yields error-control, conceptually underpinning the integration of learned dynamics with barrier-based geometric constraint enforcement.",
