  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014formulating a unified paradigm for multi-table learning with an explicit complementarity metric (CS) and an integration network (ATCA-Net)\u2014sits at the intersection of multi-view learning theory, information-theoretic quantification, and attention-based architectures for tabular data. Co-training provides the conceptual backbone: different tables are treated as distinct views whose agreement and complementarity can be systematically exploited within task objectives. To operationalize complementarity, the authors\u2019 CS metric extends the classic mRMR balance of relevance versus redundancy by adding an explicit informativeness component, thereby separating what is shared (useful similarity) from what is uniquely predictive across tables. DCCA informs the similarity/relevance facet through learned cross-view correlations, while contrastive objectives such as CPC\u2019s InfoNCE offer practical estimators/losses to capture informativeness and minimize trivial alignments. Architecturally, ATCA-Net\u2019s Adaptive Table encoder inherits tabular tokenization and contextual embedding ideas from TabTransformer, adapting attention to heterogeneous columns and schemas. Its Cross-table Attention mechanism borrows from co-attentional fusion in multimodal transformers like ViLBERT, enabling targeted information flow between tables conditioned on task signals and estimated complementarity. Finally, Set Transformer principles guide permutation-invariant handling of variable-sized, schema-flexible table inputs. Together, these strands directly enable the paper\u2019s formal task/loss definitions, CS-based complementarity quantification, and cross-table attention integration that constitute the proposed multi-table learning paradigm.",
