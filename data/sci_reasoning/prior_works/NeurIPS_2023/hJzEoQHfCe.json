  "synthesis_narrative": "Unified Embedding\u2019s core innovation\u2014Feature Multiplexing\u2014emerges at the intersection of three lines of work: (1) standard practice in recommendation models, (2) aggressive parameter sharing/compression for embeddings, and (3) additive decomposition signals that disambiguate mixed sources in a shared space. DLRM crystallized the prevailing assumption of independent embedding tables per feature, though this design strains memory at web scale. Entity embeddings established the effectiveness of learned dense vectors for categorical variables, but did not address the multi-table memory wall.\n\nCompression-centric methods then showed that heavy parameter sharing can retain accuracy. Feature hashing multiplexed heterogeneous features into a single index space via collisions, while Bloom embeddings and Hash Embeddings demonstrated that shared codebooks and learned combinations can approximate independent embeddings with far fewer parameters. These works collectively suggested that collisions and sharing need not destroy semantics if the model can recover separable components.\n\nConcurrently, additive decomposition mechanisms in representation learning\u2014most prominently BERT\u2019s token-type and positional embeddings\u2014provided a clean recipe for disambiguating multiple sources within one vector space by adding type-specific signals. Field-aware Factorization Machines emphasized the importance of field identity in interaction modeling, which Unified Embedding preserves via feature-identity components while flipping the paradigm to a single shared table. Together, these strands directly informed Unified Embedding\u2019s theoretically grounded view that multiplexed vectors can be decomposed into feature-specific components, enabling a single, battle-tested representation space that is both memory-efficient and performant at web scale.",
