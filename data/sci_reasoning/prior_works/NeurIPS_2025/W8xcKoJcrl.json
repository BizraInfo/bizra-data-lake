  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014a game-theoretic model where group-specific perceived post-selection value drives strategic effort under merit-only selection, leading to closed-form equilibrium characterizations and a cost-sensitive policy design\u2014sits at the intersection of three lines of prior work. First, Coate and Loury provide the conceptual backbone: perceived returns and beliefs shape investment incentives and can yield self-confirming disparities in representation. The present work operationalizes this idea as group-dependent valuations, including those shaped by AI advice, which enter payoffs and hence effort choices.\nSecond, the incentive-theoretic machinery comes from strategic behavior under selection rules. Hardt et al. (Strategic Classification) and Kleinberg\u2013Raghavan formalize how thresholds induce agents to invest costly effort, connecting decision rules to welfare. Liu et al. extend this to dynamic, group-level impacts, motivating the paper\u2019s explicit coupling between institutional selectivity and induced effort, representation, and social welfare. These works collectively inform the equilibrium structure and the interpretation of policy effects through incentives.\nThird, technical underpinnings come from contest theory and nonatomic games. Skaperdas\u2019s contest success function framework maps merit-based selection to effort competition for scarce slots, guiding equilibrium derivations, while Schmeidler\u2019s nonatomic equilibrium enables the large-agent limit and uniqueness claimed by the authors. Finally, the proposed cost-sensitive optimization to modify selection policies draws on the fairness\u2013utility trade-off literature (Menon\u2013Williamson), providing a principled objective to quantify and navigate the strategic costs of perceived bias in selection.",
