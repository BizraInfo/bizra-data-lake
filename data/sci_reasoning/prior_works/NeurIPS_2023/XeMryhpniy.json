  "synthesis_narrative": "HI-Diff arises at the intersection of diffusion generative priors and distortion-accurate regression-based deblurring. DDPM established the iterative denoise-and-sample mechanism, while the SDE formulation unified diffusion/score models and showed how such priors can be exploited for inverse problems like deblurring. However, end-to-end diffusion restorers (e.g., SR3) and diffusion-prior solvers (e.g., DDRM) demonstrated two practical obstacles for deblurring benchmarks: high sampling cost and a mismatch with distortion-centric metrics (PSNR/SSIM). Latent Diffusion Models provided a decisive efficiency insight\u2014perform diffusion in a compact latent space to retain semantic priors at far lower computational cost. On the reconstruction side, modern regression-based restorers such as MPRNet and Restormer showed that hierarchical, multi-scale feature processing excels on distortion metrics, but can under-recover fine details in challenging, realistic blur. HI-Diff synthesizes these threads: it performs diffusion in a highly compact latent space purely to generate strong multi-scale priors, then hierarchically integrates these priors with content features inside a regression-based deblurring pipeline. This hierarchical integration preserves the efficiency and PSNR strengths of regression models while leveraging diffusion\u2019s capacity to hallucinate plausible details, effectively bridging the perceptual\u2013distortion gap and mitigating the sampling inefficiency endemic to pixel-space diffusion restorers.",
