  "synthesis_narrative": "FAFE\u2019s core idea\u2014replacing AlphaFold\u2019s point-based FAPE with a geodesic, frame-to-frame objective\u2014sits squarely on the intellectual foundation laid by AlphaFold (Jumper et al., 2021), which introduced the frame representation and FAPE itself. AlphaFold-Multimer (Evans et al., 2022) is the operative baseline and problem setting: its difficulties on immune complex docking, where large rotational errors are common, expose FAPE\u2019s failure mode that FAFE addresses. The decisive conceptual shift comes from the 3D vision/robotics literature on pose learning, especially Kendall and Cipolla (2017), which established that geodesic losses on SO(3) yield stable rotation gradients, directly motivating FAFE\u2019s move away from point-aligned penalties. Turning that insight into a principled protein loss requires Lie-group machinery: Sol\u00e0 et al. (2018) provides the SE(3) log/exp and geodesic distance formalism that FAFE uses to recast residue-to-residue discrepancies as group-to-group geodesic frame distances. Parallel advances in rigid docking underscore the value of SE(3)-aware objectives: EquiDock (Ganea et al., 2022) and DiffDock (Corso et al., 2023) both operationalize group geometry for docking, reinforcing that optimizing geodesic distances between rigid motions improves stability and accuracy. Together, these works directly enable FAFE\u2019s diagnosis of FAPE\u2019s gradient issues and the design of a group-geodesic frame loss that, when used to fine-tune AF2/AF2-Multimer, materially improves antibody\u2013antigen complex modeling.",
