  "synthesis_narrative": "The key contribution of DP-RandP is to improve differentially private image classification by learning transferable visual priors from procedurally generated, random-process images and then privately fine-tuning on sensitive data. This idea grows directly out of two lines of work. First, Abadi et al.\u2019s DP-SGD defined the practical recipe for private deep learning, but also exposed the accuracy gap caused by clipping and noise, motivating strategies that strengthen model priors prior to DP optimization. Second, research on leveraging non-private priors showed that public data or external supervision can dramatically aid private learning\u2014exemplified by PATE\u2019s use of public/unlabeled data for knowledge transfer and by the broader pretrain-then-finetune paradigm popularized by SimCLR.\n\nDP-RandP\u2019s distinct step is to remove dependence on real public images by importing insights from synthetic-data transfer. Domain Randomization demonstrated that procedurally generated scenes can teach models features that generalize to the real world, while FractalDB showed that large corpora of algorithmically generated fractals can serve as effective pretraining data for CNNs. Complementing these, Deep Image Prior established that strong natural-image regularities can emerge from architecture and noise alone, suggesting that useful inductive biases need not come from real images. DP-RandP unifies these insights into a three-phase pipeline: learn general visual priors from random-process images, then transfer and fine-tune under DP-SGD on private datasets. By strengthening the representation before the noisy private phase, it materially narrows the DP-SGD utility gap and achieves state-of-the-art private accuracy without relying on real public data.",
