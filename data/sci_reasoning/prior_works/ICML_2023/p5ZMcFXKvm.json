  "synthesis_narrative": "The core contribution of Warm-Start Actor-Critic is a finite-time characterization of how actor and critic approximation errors, in the presence of a prior (offline) policy, translate into a sub-optimality gap\u2014and when warm-starting accelerates learning. This builds directly on the policy-gradient and compatible function-approximation framework of Sutton et al. (1999) and the two-timescale actor-critic formulation of Konda and Tsitsiklis (2000), which together define the algorithmic structure whose inaccuracies the paper quantifies. Kakade\u2019s natural policy gradient (2002) provides the crucial Newton/Gauss\u2013Newton lens: by explicitly casting warm-start A-C as a perturbed Newton method, the authors connect curvature-informed updates to acceleration conditions and make the role of approximation error transparent. Empirically, AWAC (Nair et al., 2020) crystallized warm-start RL\u2014initializing online training from an offline policy\u2014and documented both rapid gains and occasional stagnation; the present work targets exactly this phenomenon, offering conditions under which warm starts help or hinder. On the technical side, the critic\u2019s finite-time error behavior is handled using ideas from Bhandari et al. (2018) on TD with function approximation, enabling a clean translation from critic inaccuracy to actor update bias. Finally, Borkar\u2019s stochastic-approximation framework (2008) undergirds the two-timescale and perturbation analysis that justifies the finite-time performance guarantees with inexact updates. Together, these works constitute the direct intellectual lineage for the paper\u2019s Newton-with-perturbation view and its error-to-suboptimality theory for warm-start actor-critic.",
