# OPERATIONS QUEUE — Home Base Cleanup & Hardening

Status: **Active**

## 1) Immediate Actions (No Risk)
- [x] Create fast, read‑only **index** of core docs + code entry points
- [x] Build **doc lineage map** (Genesis → Architecture → SAPE → Sovereign)
- [ ] Create **data lake glossary** (key terms, acronyms, conventions)

## 2) Security & Footprint Reduction (Requires approval)
- [ ] Inventory installed apps + services (report first)
- [ ] Disable Windows Insider telemetry + tighten privacy controls
- [ ] Remove unused apps after review
- [ ] Consolidate OneDrive → local (verify backups)
- [ ] Reduce email accounts 6 → 3 (2 business, 1 personal)
- [ ] Rotate all passwords (managed, staged rollout)

## 3) Codebase Validation
- [ ] Re‑run `pytest tests/core/` (verify any regressions)
- [ ] Triage known failures in `test_graph_reasoner.py` (prune function)
- [ ] Confirm elite/living/iaas suites remain green

## 4) Knowledge Base System (Core)
- [x] Implement **lightweight manifest** per folder (README + index)
- [x] Build **SNR‑aware retrieval** for 00_GENESIS + 02_PROCESSED (ingest gates + query trace)
- [ ] Create **hypergraph entry points** (graph seeds)
