  "synthesis_narrative": "This paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014a sharp tradeoff between excess risk and m-traceability in \u2113p stochastic convex optimization (SCO), with a phase transition that aligns with optimal differentially private (DP) error for p in [1,2]\u2014rests on two intertwined intellectual threads: accuracy\u2192identification lower bounds and geometry-aware optimization/DP rates. The reconstruction paradigm of Dinur\u2013Nissim established that sufficiently accurate outputs enable identifying a large fraction of the dataset, a perspective later refined via fingerprinting/traitor-tracing arguments by Bun\u2013Ullman\u2013Vadhan to obtain robust privacy lower bounds from tracing attacks. These works directly motivate and technically inform the paper\u2019s formal traceability notion and its lower-bound machinery that converts low excess risk into identifiability of many training samples.\nConcurrently, the DP framework of Dwork\u2013McSherry\u2013Nissim\u2013Smith and sharp excess-risk guarantees for private ERM by Bassily\u2013Smith\u2013Thakurta delineate what error is achievable under DP for convex Lipschitz learning. On the algorithmic side, Beck\u2013Teboulle\u2019s mirror descent furnishes the \u2113p-geometry toolkit (dual norms, mirror maps) that governs excess-risk rates and yields sample-efficient SCO learners under different p. Bringing these strands together, the paper shows that for p\u2208[1,2] the non-traceable region coincides with known optimal DP rates, yielding a crisp phase transition; for p>2, its traceability bounds imply new DP lower bounds, narrowing a recognized gap. Finally, empirical membership inference insights (Shokri et al.) underscore the practical salience of traceability, while foundational results on private learnability (Kasiviswanathan et al.) contextualize the phase transition between safe (non-traceable) and inherently revealing regimes.",
