  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014characterizing a train\u2013inference tradeoff for masked diffusion models (MDMs) and exploiting adaptive token ordering to mitigate hard subproblems\u2014rests on three intertwined threads of prior work. First, discrete diffusion formalisms such as D3PM and Multinomial Diffusion established principled corruption\u2013denoising processes for categorical data, making masked infilling a first-class training target. These works define the transition kernels and learning objectives that, in this paper, are shown to implicitly require solving computationally intractable conditional inference tasks compared to autoregressive factorization.\nSecond, a body of non-autoregressive, masked, and non-monotonic generation methods\u2014Mask-Predict and MaskGIT for iterative masked decoding, and the Insertion Transformer for flexible, non-left-to-right construction\u2014demonstrated that token order at inference is a powerful degree of freedom. Their confidence- or utility-based token selection policies directly inspire the paper\u2019s adaptive decoding strategy, which \u201cplans for the best\u201d by choosing easy tokens first to avoid combinatorially challenging infills.\nThird, permutation- and MRF-based perspectives (XLNet and BERT-as-MRF) provide the conceptual backdrop: training over many (even all) orders equips a model for worst-case conditioning patterns, but computing exact conditionals can be hard in general graphical structures. Building on these insights, the paper formalizes why MDM training faces inherently harder subproblems than autoregressive training, and shows empirically that inference-time order selection leverages MDMs\u2019 flexibility to bypass hard constraints\u2014yielding large gains on structured logic tasks like Sudoku.",
