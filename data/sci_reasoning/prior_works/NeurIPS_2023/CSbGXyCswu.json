  "synthesis_narrative": "Wu et al.\u2019s core contribution\u2014a fine-grained RLHF framework with dense, segment-level rewards and multiple attribute-specific reward models\u2014arises from combining lessons across RLHF, multi-objective alignment, and span-level evaluation. Sequence-level RLHF was established by Stiennon et al. and broadened by Ouyang et al. for instruction following, but both rely on holistic preferences, which obscure where and why long outputs fail. Bai et al. showed that separate reward models can express competing objectives (helpfulness vs. harmlessness), suggesting modular rewards as a practical mechanism to represent distinct desiderata. Glaese et al. further emphasized targeted, category-specific judgments for safety, motivating the move from undifferentiated preferences to attribute-aware feedback signals. In parallel, Saunders et al. demonstrated that process supervision\u2014rewarding intermediate steps\u2014improves credit assignment versus outcome-only feedback, a principle Wu et al. generalize to open-ended text by delivering per-segment rewards. Finally, FRANK\u2019s span-level error annotations and taxonomy provided a blueprint for operationalizing fine-grained labels that distinguish error types and their locations. Synthesizing these strands, Wu et al. depart from monolithic, end-to-end rewards by (1) densifying rewards at the sentence/sub-sentence level to localize credit and (2) learning multiple, type-specific reward models that can be composed during training, yielding more informative and controllable signals for aligning language model generation.",
