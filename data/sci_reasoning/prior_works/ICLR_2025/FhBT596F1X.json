  "synthesis_narrative": "Machine learning for electronic structure first showed that the nonlocal Hohenberg\u2013Kohn map can be approximated directly, as demonstrated by Brockherde et al., who learned energies and densities without explicit Kohn\u2013Sham machinery. In parallel, Vydrov and Van Voorhis crystallized the importance of nonlocal correlation through explicit density\u2013density kernels (VV10), underscoring that long-range interactions are essential yet difficult to encode with semilocal forms. Nagai, Akashi, and Sugino then embedded neural approximators into the self-consistent Kohn\u2013Sham loop and differentiated through SCF, proving that XC models can be trained with only energy targets while remaining variationally consistent. NeuralXC introduced compact, atom-centered projections of the electron density, showing that per-atom density descriptors can drive learned XC corrections. Drautz\u2019s atomic cluster expansion provided a principled SO(3)-structured, nuclei-centered tensor basis to represent fields around atoms efficiently. Building on this, NequIP established that SO(3)-equivariant message passing captures anisotropic, long-range interactions in a scalable way. Despite progress, DM21 revealed that even advanced semilocal NN-XC functionals still struggle with inherently nonlocal effects. Together, these works suggested an opportunity: compress the electron density into an SO(3)-equivariant, nuclei-centered representation (ACE/NeuralXC) and propagate information nonlocally via equivariant message passing (NequIP), while training the functional end-to-end through the SCF loop using only energy supervision (Nagai et al.). This synthesis naturally leads to a scalable, symmetry-respecting, nonlocal XC functional that can address the limitations exposed by DM21 and capture the long-range physics codified by VV10.",

To date, machine-learned and human-designed approximations suffer from insufficient accuracy, limited scalability, or dependence on costly reference data. To address these issues, we introduce Equivariant Graph Exchange Correlation (EG-XC), a novel non-local XC functional based on equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs). Where previous works relied on semi-local functionals or fixed-size descriptors of the density, we compress the electron density into an SO(3)-equivariant nuclei-centered point cloud for efficient non-local atomic-range interactions. By applying an equivariant GNN on this point cloud, we capture molecular-range interactions in a scalable and accurate manner. To train EG-XC, we differentiate through a self-consistent field solver requiring only energy targets. In our empirical evaluation, we find EG-XC to accurately reconstruct `",
