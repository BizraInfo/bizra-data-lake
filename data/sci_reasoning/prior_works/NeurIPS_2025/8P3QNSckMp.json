  "synthesis_narrative": "A Clean Slate for Offline Reinforcement Learning tackles two intertwined bottlenecks: muddled algorithmic distinctions and opaque, inconsistent evaluation practices. Its taxonomy is grounded in the principal offline RL algorithmic lineages\u2014policy support constraints and distribution matching (BCQ, BEAR), value pessimism (CQL), and simple implicit value learning (IQL). By unifying these families, the paper delineates what each method is actually optimizing and which components are essential versus incidental, enabling cleaner ablations and apples-to-apples comparisons. On the evaluation front, prior work has relied heavily on D4RL as the de facto benchmark, yet comparisons were often confounded by undocumented online tuning. Building on the broader reproducibility lessons from Deep Reinforcement Learning that Matters, the paper specifies a transparent protocol that explicitly meters online interaction budgets used for hyperparameter selection and reporting, thereby closing a key loophole in offline RL evaluation. Finally, inspired by CleanRL\u2019s single-file ethos, the authors deliver lightweight reimplementations that minimize boilerplate, making algorithmic differences legible and accelerating experimentation. Together, these strands\u2014canonical algorithms (BCQ, BEAR, CQL, IQL), standardized datasets (D4RL), rigorous evaluation practices, and clean implementations\u2014directly shape the paper\u2019s core contribution: a rigorous, reproducible, and efficient foundation for fair offline RL research and development.",
