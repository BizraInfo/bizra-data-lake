  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of the paper is to cast second-order RNNs (2RNNs) through the lens of CP tensor decomposition (CPRNN), thereby controlling capacity via tensor rank while retaining the expressivity advantages of bilinear dynamics. This builds directly on the early second-order RNN literature (Giles et al., 1992), which established bilinear updates and their tight relationship with finite-state behaviors, motivating the paper\u2019s attention to expressivity and formal language connections. Kolda and Bader (2009) provide the essential mathematical machinery for CP decomposition, enabling the authors to parameterize the 3-way transition tensor with an interpretable rank that tunes model capacity.\n\nOn the modeling side, Sutskever et al. (2011) showed how factorized multiplicative RNNs make second-order interactions practical, a design philosophy CPRNN generalizes and systematizes using CP. Complementarily, Wu et al. (2016) introduced MIRNN, a restricted multiplicative form; the paper situates MIRNN as a special/limiting case within the CPRNN rank-structure spectrum, clarifying relationships among RNN, 2RNN, MIRNN, and CPRNN by hidden size and rank. Beyond recurrent modeling, Novikov et al. (2015) demonstrated that tensor decompositions can compress neural networks without catastrophic performance loss, supporting CPRNN\u2019s efficiency claims. Finally, Balle et al. (2012) connect tensor methods to weighted automata, framing the formal underpinnings for the paper\u2019s expressivity analysis, while Kim et al. (2016) show in another domain that low-rank bilinear factorization preserves modeling power, reinforcing CPRNN\u2019s rank\u2013expressivity tradeoff and guiding its empirical evaluation on language modeling.",
