  "synthesis_narrative": "ORC-ManL\u2019s core idea\u2014using Ollivier\u2013Ricci curvature to prune shortcut edges from kNN graphs\u2014rests squarely on Ollivier\u2019s (2009) definition of coarse Ricci curvature on metric measure spaces, which provides a principled, transport-based notion of edge curvature applicable to graphs. Empirical and theoretical insights from Jost and Liu (2014) directly motivate the pruning rule: they demonstrated that edges embedded within triangle-rich local neighborhoods tend to have higher (less negative) Ollivier curvature, whereas inter-community bridges are markedly negative\u2014exactly the signature of ambient-space shortcuts that derail manifold methods. The need to excise such shortcuts is the central gap identified since Isomap (Tenenbaum et al., 2000), which relies on geodesic distances over a kNN graph and is notoriously sensitive to short-circuit edges. Within the established framework for inferring manifold topology from noisy samples (Niyogi, Smale, and Weinberger, 2008), improving the fidelity of the underlying proximity graph is crucial; ORC-ManL\u2019s curvature-guided pruning directly targets this bottleneck and supports better homology, dimension, and geometry recovery. The method is evaluated against classical graph-pruning baselines\u2014Relative Neighborhood Graph (Toussaint, 1980) and shared/mutual-nearest-neighbor constructions (Jarvis and Patrick, 1973)\u2014whose angle- or neighbor-overlap criteria struggle under heterogeneous sampling and high-dimensional noise. Finally, because modern workflows like UMAP (McInnes et al., 2018) depend critically on the quality of the kNN graph, ORC-ManL\u2019s edge-level curvature criterion provides a drop-in improvement that translates into stronger manifold learning and single-cell analyses.",
