  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014characterizing optimal 0-1 loss for multi-class classification with a test-time attacker through a conflict hypergraph and efficient game variants\u2014rests on three conceptual pillars established by prior work. First, the minimax adversarial risk framework of Madry et al. defines the objective of interest: a classifier\u2019s worst-case test-time loss within a threat model. This work keeps that objective but shifts focus from training algorithms to the distribution-level optimum, asking what robust 0-1 loss is fundamentally achievable.\nSecond, the robust Bayes perspective of Montasser, Hanneke, and Srebro provides the formal groundwork for defining optimal robust classification under perturbation sets. The present paper operationalizes this theory for discrete multi-class settings by encoding perturbation-induced label conflicts in a hypergraph, extending pairwise conflict reasoning from binary cases to higher-arity constraints intrinsic to multi-class problems.\nThird, information-theoretic analyses of robustness (Schmidt et al.; Bubeck et al.) motivate distribution-aware limits. While those works derive impossibility/limit theorems in stylized or continuous settings, this paper supplies achievable, dataset-specific lower bounds on optimal robust loss for any discrete dataset, thereby furnishing a practical diagnostic of how far existing methods are from the true optimum. Finally, algorithmic certification approaches such as randomized smoothing offer practice-facing baselines; by contrasting certified/empirical robustness with the paper\u2019s optimal-loss bounds, one can precisely measure the gap to optimal robustness in multi-class benchmarks. Together, these threads directly inform the paper\u2019s hypergraph-based characterization and its efficient attacker\u2013classifier game relaxations.",
