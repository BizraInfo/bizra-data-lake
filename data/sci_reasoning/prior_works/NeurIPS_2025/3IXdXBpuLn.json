  "synthesis_narrative": "SHF\u2019s core idea emerges from ViT\u2019s patch-based formulation, which created the long-sequence bottleneck when moving to high-resolution medical images. Prior work addressed this either by altering attention or inserting complex hierarchical modules. Swin Transformer exemplifies the former, achieving sub-quadratic costs via windowed attention but at the price of architectural complexity and design choices tied to windowing and shifting. In medical imaging, UNETR showed the promise of ViT encoders but relied on convolutional decoders and fixed patch sizes, leaving compute and memory strained at high resolutions. SegFormer proved that decoders could be drastically simplified, but still required a decoding head.\nSHF charts a third path by shifting hierarchy construction to the input: inspired by token aggregation ideas like Token Merging, it adaptively patches the image to increase token information density and encode spatial hierarchy before the encoder. On the output side, SHF generalizes the notion behind Swin-Unet\u2019s patch-expanding and MAE\u2019s un/patchify operations, introducing a reverse depatching that maps encoder tokens back to dense predictions, eliminating convolution-based decoders entirely. Together, these influences define SHF\u2019s symmetrical hierarchical forest: a lightweight, encoder-centric pipeline that leverages a pretrained ViT while avoiding modified attention and heavy decoders, directly addressing the long-sequence challenge in high-resolution 3D medical segmentation.",
