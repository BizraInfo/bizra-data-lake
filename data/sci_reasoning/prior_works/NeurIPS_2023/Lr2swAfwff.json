Conservative Policy Iteration (Kakade & Langford) further motivates examining a single greedy step from a baseline policy, highlighting conditions under which incremental improvement is reliable. Approximate dynamic programming analyses by Munos & Szepesv\u00e1ri introduce concentrability, formalizing how value errors learned under one distribution affect control under another\u2014a conceptual precursor to assessing whether Q values learned from random-policy data will guide effective control.\n\nOn the other side, the paper positions its empirical finding against prevailing theoretical predictors. Regret and sample-complexity analyses in tabular RL\u2014UCRL2 (Jaksch et al.) and UCBVI (Azar et al.)\u2014provide the canonical bounds the authors compute exactly via BRIDGE, showing these worst-case or broadly instance-agnostic quantities do not track when deep RL actually works. Similarly, structure-based complexity notions for function approximation, such as Bellman rank (Jiang et al.), offer instance-dependent learnability guarantees but still fail to predict practical success across the BRIDGE suite.\n\nBridging these threads, Generalized Policy Improvement with successor features (Barreto et al.) directly supports the paper\u2019s diagnostic: greedifying with respect to Q-functions from other policies can yield improvement. The authors\u2019 \u201ceffective horizon\u201d operationalizes how quickly such greedification from the random policy aligns with optimal actions, providing an instance-dependent, empirically predictive quantity that connects policy improvement theory to deep RL practice.",
