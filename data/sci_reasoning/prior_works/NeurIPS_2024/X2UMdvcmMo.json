  "synthesis_narrative": "FuseAnyPart\u2019s core contribution\u2014assembling facial parts from multiple reference images in latent space and injecting the consolidated features into a diffusion UNet\u2014sits at the confluence of masked diffusion editing, exemplar-guided conditioning, and efficient feature injection. Blended Diffusion pioneered applying diffusion selectively to masked regions, providing the blueprint for preserving untouched areas while editing targeted parts\u2014a paradigm directly reflected in FuseAnyPart\u2019s Mask-based Fusion Module. Paint by Example extended this idea by using exemplar images to drive the appearance of the masked region, aligning with FuseAnyPart\u2019s goal of swapping specific facial parts from different references.\n\nOn the conditioning side, Plug-and-Play Diffusion Features showed that internal UNet features can be injected to steer generation without retraining, while ControlNet and T2I-Adapter formalized additive, residual-style side conditioning and lightweight adapters for efficient, scalable control. These works collectively motivate FuseAnyPart\u2019s Addition-based Injection Module that fuses aggregated part features into the UNet through addition, balancing effectiveness and efficiency.\n\nFinally, IP-Adapter\u2019s image-prompt conditioning (including multi-image variants) demonstrates how multiple visual references can be harmonized within diffusion, a direct precursor to FuseAnyPart\u2019s multi-reference feature fusion for different facial components. Classical full-face methods like FaceShifter set the identity-preservation and fidelity bar but lacked fine-grained part compositionality; FuseAnyPart advances this frontier by unifying mask-based latent assembly with adapter-style additive feature injection to achieve flexible, high-quality, multi-source facial part swapping.",
