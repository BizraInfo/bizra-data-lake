  "synthesis_narrative": "MAP-Elites established the repertoire-building paradigm: partition a behavior space with an archive, then iteratively propose and insert elites that maximize quality within each cell. Differentiable Quality Diversity extended this paradigm by showing that when objectives and behavior descriptors are differentiable, gradients can guide proposals toward under-filled regions and higher performance. Building on that, CMA-MEGA introduced gradient arborescence\u2014branching sequences of gradient-informed proposals from a parent solution\u2014to efficiently traverse the elite hypervolume by exploiting local gradient information for both objective and descriptors. In parallel, PGA-MAP-Elites demonstrated that policy-gradient signals from deep RL can accelerate QD search inside MAP-Elites, but its use of deterministic off-policy TD3 exposed fragility in stochastic environments. CEM-RL likewise fused evolutionary sampling with off-policy RL for efficient policy search, yet retained the same deterministic and off-policy limitations. Proximal Policy Optimization, with its clipped surrogate and KL-aware updates, provided a robust on-policy mechanism for stable improvements with stochastic policies.\nTogether, these works suggest a path: retain archive-based QD search, use arborescent branching to multiply gradient-guided proposals, but replace deterministic off-policy gradients with PPO\u2019s proximal on-policy updates to handle stochasticity while preserving stability. The resulting synthesis naturally adapts DQD\u2019s gradient-guided emitters to RL by estimating both objective and descriptor gradients via policy gradients and executing PPO-style bounded updates along multiple branches, overcoming the core shortcomings of prior QD-RL hybrids.",
