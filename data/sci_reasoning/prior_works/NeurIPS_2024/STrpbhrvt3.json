  "synthesis_narrative": "KnoBo\u2019s central idea\u2014constraining medical image models to reason through explicit, clinically grounded concepts sourced from textbooks and PubMed\u2014sits at the intersection of three influential threads. First, Concept Bottleneck Models established a blueprint for interpretable-by-design architectures that require predictions to flow through human-understandable concepts. KnoBo directly extends this blueprint by replacing manual concept supervision with concepts discovered and supervised via external clinical text. Second, advances in language-driven vision and knowledge access made this feasible: CLIP demonstrated that natural language can serve as a powerful visual prior, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation provided the mechanism to fetch supporting facts at train/inference time. Domain-specific biomedical LMs such as PubMedBERT enable accurate parsing and representation of medical terminology, ensuring retrieved knowledge can be operationalized into reliable concept signals. Third, the method is explicitly motivated by the failures of standard backbones under distribution shift in medical imaging, as documented by Zech et al., and by the limitations of purely statistical robustness methods like GroupDRO and IRM. Whereas those approaches optimize for invariance or reweighting across environments, KnoBo injects an architectural knowledge prior: it forces the model to ground its reasoning in clinically relevant factors derived from authoritative texts. This synthesis yields improved domain generalization by aligning the model\u2019s internal concepts with the causal clinical attributes expected to transfer across hospitals and demographics.",
