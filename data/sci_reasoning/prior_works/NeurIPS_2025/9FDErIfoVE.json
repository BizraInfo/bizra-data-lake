  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of the paper is a first global convergence guarantee for Alternating Least Squares (ALS) in overparameterized tensor decompositions. This advances the emerging line of theory showing that overparameterization can regularize nonconvex tensor objectives. The immediate predecessor is Wang et al. (NeurIPS 2020), who proved global convergence for an overparameterized gradient-descent variant with k = O(r^{7.5} log n). Their result created a clear gap\u2014ALS, the field\u2019s workhorse, still lacked such guarantees\u2014which this paper closes by analyzing ALS directly in the overparameterized regime. The analysis is grounded in the classical CP/PARAFAC formulation introduced by Harshman (1970) and Carroll & Chang (1970), and leverages identifiability insights from Kruskal\u2019s uniqueness theory to relate overparameterized iterates to true components. Methodologically, the work draws inspiration from alternating-update guarantees in tensors\u2014most notably Anandkumar et al. (2014), whose alternating rank\u20111 method established global recovery under non-orthogonality\u2014and adapts that alternating perspective to the ALS updates while contending with overparameterization. In shaping the problem\u2019s motivation, Kolda & Bader (2009) codified CP\u2011ALS\u2019s practical dominance and highlighted the lack of global guarantees that this paper directly addresses. Finally, proof techniques echo successful alternating minimization analyses in related low-rank nonconvex problems (e.g., Jain et al., 2013), importing incoherence conditions and leave\u2011one\u2011out style controls to manage interactions among extra components introduced by overparameterization. Together, these works form the direct intellectual lineage enabling ALS guarantees under overparameterization.",
