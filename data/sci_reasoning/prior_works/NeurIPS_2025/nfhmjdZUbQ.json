  "synthesis_narrative": "R-AutoEval+ sits at the intersection of semi-supervised inference, automated LLM-based evaluation, and sequentially valid uncertainty quantification. The core bias-correction and variance-reduction mechanism is inherited from Prediction-Powered Inference, which uses a predictive model as a control variate to combine many cheap, biased predictions with a small set of expensive, unbiased labels. This directly addresses the central weakness of LLM-as-judge autoevaluation, popularized by MT-Bench and Chatbot Arena, where synthetic ratings are abundant but systematically biased. While PPI debiases synthetic judgments, R-AutoEval+ goes further by guaranteeing that incorporating autoevaluators cannot worsen sample efficiency relative to label-only estimators. This \u201cimproved-or-no-worse\u201d property reflects classical control-variate optimization and the doubly robust tradition in policy evaluation, in which a biased low-variance proxy is blended with unbiased supervision to lower variance without sacrificing validity. To provide finite-sample reliability under adaptive data collection and stopping\u2014critical for practical autoevaluation pipelines\u2014R-AutoEval+ draws on confidence sequence methodology for anytime-valid inference, ensuring coverage does not deteriorate when analysts adaptively query labels or evaluators. Finally, the framework\u2019s approach to uncertainty quantification is informed by conformal risk control, emphasizing distribution-free guarantees for performance metrics. Together, these strands yield an adaptive, prediction-powered autoevaluation method with provable finite-sample reliability and robust sample-efficiency guarantees tailored to modern LLM evaluation settings.",
