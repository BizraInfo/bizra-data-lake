  "synthesis_narrative": "Brockherde et al. framed electron density prediction as a learnable map, proving that data-driven models can reproduce densities and associated energies without solving Kohn\u2013Sham equations, and establishing practical metrics for assessing density fields. Ramakrishnan et al. introduced the \u0394-learning principle to lift low-fidelity quantum estimates to high-fidelity targets, while Bogojeski et al. showed that multi-fidelity corrections and small-data fine-tuning can attain quantum-chemical accuracy efficiently. Jain et al.\u2019s Materials Project demonstrated how large, carefully curated PBE-level DFT corpora for inorganic crystals enable scalable supervised learning, and Choudhary et al.\u2019s JARVIS-DFT paired PBE with select HSE calculations, illustrating the value of multi-fidelity datasets yet leaving charge-density fields largely unexplored. Xie and Grossman\u2019s CGCNN provided the dominant crystal-graph representation and message-passing baseline for learning from periodic materials, and Dunn et al.\u2019s Matbench defined rigorous benchmarking practices in materials ML but omitted electron-density prediction tasks. Together these works revealed that electron densities are learnable targets, that multi-fidelity transfer can efficiently bridge accuracy gaps, and that large PBE-scale resources can seed models if complemented by scarce high-level data. The natural next step was to create a standardized, crystal-focused benchmark that operationalizes \u0394-learning from PBE to HSE for full charge-density fields, leverages established crystal GNN baselines, and adheres to transparent benchmarking protocols. By assembling a large PBE charge-density corpus with a targeted HSE subset and designing tasks around pretraining-to-finetuning, the approach synthesizes these insights into a practical route to enhanced-precision density prediction in inorganic crystals.",

Although current DFT datasets mainly emphasize chemical properties and atomic forces, the precise prediction of electronic charge density is essential for accurately determining a system's total energy and ground state properties. In this study, we introduce a novel electronic charge density dataset named ECD, which encompasses 140,646 stable crystal geometries with medium-precision Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof (PBE) functional data. Within this dataset, a subset of 7,147 geometries includes high-precision electronic charge density data calculated using the Heyd\u2013Scuseria\u2013Ernzerhof (HSE) functional in DFT. By designing various benchmark tasks for crystalline materials and emphasizing training with large-scale PBE data while fine-tuning with a smaller subset of high-precision HSE data, we de",
