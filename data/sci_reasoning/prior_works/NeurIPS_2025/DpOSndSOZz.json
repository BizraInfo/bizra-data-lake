  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014an information-theoretic framework to measure and control the efficiency of multi-step reasoning, culminating in an entropy-based Adaptive Think strategy\u2014sits at the intersection of chain-of-thought prompting, search-based deliberation, and adaptive computation. Kojima et al. established chain-of-thought as the de facto \"Vanilla Think\" baseline, while Wang et al.\u2019s Self-Consistency and Yao et al.\u2019s Tree of Thoughts encouraged longer or multiple reasoning paths to boost accuracy. These advances surfaced a practical tension: expanding thoughts often increases tokens and latency without guaranteed gains. This tension motivates the paper\u2019s metrics: InfoBias to quantify divergence from an ideal path and InfoGain to measure stepwise utility.\nTo operationalize efficiency, the work draws on the adaptive computation literature: Graves\u2019 Adaptive Computation Time provides the conceptual foundation for instance-wise halting, and DeeBERT demonstrates confidence-triggered early exits in NLP. CALM directly bridges to generative models, showing that entropy can serve as a confidence signal to decide when additional computation is unnecessary; the paper generalizes this to stepwise reasoning, stopping when uncertainty falls below a threshold. Finally, the InfoGain metric is rooted in information-theoretic active learning, particularly BALD\u2019s characterization of information gain as expected entropy reduction. Together, these strands yield a principled method to monitor informational progress during reasoning and to adaptively halt when additional steps are unlikely to help, improving efficiency while preserving accuracy.",
