  "synthesis_narrative": "Contrastive language\u2013image pretraining established a simple dual-encoder framework that aligns heterogeneous modalities with an InfoNCE objective, showing that paired data can induce a shared semantic space supportive of diverse downstream tasks. In symbolic mathematics, large-scale synthetic corpora and transformer models learned to integrate, differentiate, and manipulate expressions purely from tokenized equations, revealing that programmatic generation and symbolic sequence modeling scalably capture algebraic structure\u2014but without any numeric grounding. Symbolic regression methods long focused on mapping numeric observations to explicit formulas: physics-inspired pipelines decomposed expressions with dimensional and structural priors yet relied on hand-designed heuristics; sparse identification cast dynamics discovery as selecting terms from a candidate library, highlighting the core numeric-to-symbolic formulation but suffering from basis dependence and noise sensitivity; deep reinforcement learning approaches treated equations as token sequences optimized for fit and simplicity, while evolutionary search like PySR delivered strong Pareto fronts but at high search cost and without cross-task transfer. Collectively these works suggested that equations can be modeled as sequences, numeric datasets can define functions to be symbolized, and cross-modal contrastive learning can align disparate representations. The resulting gap was the absence of a task-agnostic pretraining that unifies symbolic strings with their numeric realizations. By synthesizing programmatic equation generation with paired numeric sampling and adopting a CLIP-style dual-encoder contrastive objective, the current work creates a shared embedding space that transfers across symbolic and numeric tasks, reducing reliance on heuristics and expensive search.",

    "abstract": "In an era where symbolic mathematical equations are indispensable for modeling complex natural phenomena, scientific inquiry often involves collecting observations and translating them into mathematical expressions. Recently, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for extracting insights from data. However, existing models typically specialize in either numeric or symbolic domains, and are usually trained in a supervised manner tailored to specific tasks. This approach neglects the substantial benefits that could arise from a task-agnostic multi-modal understanding between symbolic equations and their numeric counterparts. To bridge the gap, we introduce SNIP, a Symbolic-Numeric Integrated Pre-training model, which employs contrastive learning between symbolic and numeric domains, enhancing their mutual similarities in the embeddings. By performing latent space analysis, we observe that SNIP provides cross-domain insights into the representations, revealing that symbolic supervis",
