  "synthesis_narrative": "DMCMC\u2019s core innovation\u2014using MCMC in the joint space of data and diffusion time to initialize close to the data manifold and then cheaply denoise via a reverse S/ODE integrator\u2014rests on two pillars: the diffusion/score modeling framework and Langevin-based MCMC sampling with learned scores. DDPM provides the denoising formulation and reverse process that DMCMC explicitly employs for the final denoising step. The SDE/ODE perspective of score-based modeling formalized by Song et al. supplies the exact reverse dynamics DMCMC targets, as well as the context for why discretization requires many steps. DDIM\u2019s deterministic ODE trajectories are the concrete reverse-ODE integrators that DMCMC can plug into after its MCMC initialization. On the MCMC side, annealed Langevin dynamics (Song & Ermon, 2019) demonstrated that score-driven Langevin moves efficiently approach the data manifold across noise scales; DMCMC extends this idea by running Langevin in a Gibbs-style scheme over both x and t, then handing off to the ODE/SDE integrator for rapid denoising. Finally, recent fast solvers like DPM-Solver and the comprehensive EDM study define the state of the art in integration-based acceleration but still depend on good discretizations and many steps. DMCMC is expressly orthogonal to these solvers: it initializes near high-density regions so any chosen reverse S/ODE integrator (e.g., DDIM, DPM-Solver) needs far fewer steps, thereby addressing the key efficiency gap these works leave open.",
