  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014Langevin dynamics-based adaptive sampling (LAS) for PINNs\u2014emerges at the intersection of residual-driven training, adaptive refinement, and Langevin-based stochastic exploration. Raissi et al. established the residual-minimization framework of PINNs, while DeepXDE\u2019s residual-based adaptive refinement (RAR/RAR-G) operationalized a practical, high-residual sampling pipeline. However, as highlighted by Wang, Teng, and Perdikaris, PINNs are highly sensitive to optimization hyperparameters and can exhibit gradient pathologies, a vulnerability exacerbated by aggressively prioritizing only the largest residuals. Parallel developments in hp-VPINNs showed that adaptivity improves accuracy and efficiency, but also underscored stability trade-offs inherent in concentrated refinement.\nTo resolve the bias\u2013stability tension of high-residual selection, the authors draw on Langevin dynamics. Welling and Teh\u2019s SGLD provides the noisy gradient update foundation, enabling sampling from a residual-derived energy landscape rather than deterministically chasing only the hardest points. Mandt et al. further connect step size to the stationary distribution of stochastic dynamics, motivating a design that remains robust across learning rates and model complexities. Finally, lessons from online hard example mining in vision clarify why pure hard-sample emphasis can destabilize training\u2014precisely the failure mode the paper mitigates by tempering residual emphasis with Langevin noise. Together, these works directly inform LAS: a principled sampler that explores medium/low residual regions while retaining focus on high-error areas, yielding improved stability and accuracy for PINNs.",
