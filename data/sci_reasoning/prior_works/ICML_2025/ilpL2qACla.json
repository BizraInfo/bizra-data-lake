  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014an analytic, mechanistic account of creativity in convolutional diffusion models via local score (LS) and equivariant local score (ELS) machines\u2014rests on and departs from the score-based foundations laid by Hyv\u00e4rinen and Vincent. Hyv\u00e4rinen\u2019s score matching defines the optimal score estimator, while Vincent\u2019s denoising\u2013score connection clarifies how optimal denoisers relate to gradients of log densities, highlighting that, under empirical objectives and without constraints, solutions can degenerate toward reproducing training examples. Building on the modern diffusion instantiations of these ideas (Ho et al.\u2019s DDPM objective and Song et al.\u2019s continuous-time SDE formalism), the authors recast the time-indexed score field in a form amenable to analytic approximation and single-parameter calibration, enabling quantitative prediction of trained convolutional diffusion models. The decisive conceptual step comes from importing explicit architectural inductive biases\u2014locality and equivariance\u2014formalized in group-equivariant CNNs: enforcing translation equivariance and local receptive fields systematically prevents the globally optimal score and instead yields structured, compositional score fields (LS/ELS) that recombine learned local patterns. This mechanism connects directly to classic nonparametric image synthesis (Efros & Freeman), which demonstrated combinatorial novelty through local patch recombination. Finally, recent equivariant diffusion work in other domains (Hoogeboom et al.) underscores that hard symmetry constraints reshape score fields; the present paper translates that insight to 2D convnets, deriving closed-form, interpretable LS/ELS machines that reconcile theory with the observed creativity of convolutional diffusion models.",
