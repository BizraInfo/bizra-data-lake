  "synthesis_narrative": "Deng et al. extend the recent line of distribution-free risk control beyond expectations and coverage to dispersion measures of loss, which are central to societal concerns about unequal error burdens. The methodological backbone is the learn-then-test (LTT) and conformal risk control paradigm: train a flexible predictor, then use a held-out calibration set to certify that a user-specified risk stays below a target with finite-sample validity. Prior work operationalized this for event-based risks (e.g., miscoverage), but dispersion measures depend on the entire loss distribution, not just per-example indicators. To bridge this gap, the authors combine split-style calibration from conformal prediction with uniform empirical process control via the Dvoretzky\u2013Kiefer\u2013Wolfowitz inequality, allowing them to bound functionals that are Lipschitz or otherwise well-behaved with respect to the loss CDF. This mathematical move is what enables distribution-free guarantees for quantities like variance, interquantile range, or CVaR. Conceptually, fairness research\u2014particularly the link between tail losses and group disparities\u2014motivates targeting dispersion directly, while classic risk-measure theory (e.g., CVaR) supplies concrete objectives. Together, these strands yield a simple, plug-in framework: learn a model and tuning parameter, estimate the loss CDF on a calibration split, apply DKW-based confidence bands, and select settings that provably satisfy dispersion constraints at a chosen confidence level. The result is a general, distribution-free recipe that subsumes earlier risk-control methods and directly addresses inequality in model performance across individuals.",
