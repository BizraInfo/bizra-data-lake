  "synthesis_narrative": "Weighted Flow Diffusion (WFD) emerges by fusing two direct lines of prior work: strongly-local diffusion/flow methods for graph clustering and principled integration of node attributes into community detection. The local diffusion paradigm of Andersen, Chung, and Lang introduced personalized PageRank with sweep cuts as a seed-based, provably-local way to find clusters, and later heat-kernel diffusion offered a complementary baseline; WFD preserves this seeded diffusion-and-sweep machinery while explicitly reweighting the diffusion to reflect attribute proximity. In parallel, flow-based locality\u2014via FlowImprove and subsequent flow-centric formulations\u2014showed how to localize cut optimization through flow on augmented graphs; WFD borrows this flow perspective and adapts it into a light-weight \u2018flow diffusion\u2019 that remains local but now incorporates attribute-weighted capacities during mass propagation. On the attribute side, Covariate-Assisted Spectral Clustering established a rigorous framework for blending structural edges with node features under models combining SBMs and feature distributions, motivating WFD\u2019s contextual random graph model that unifies SBM with high-dimensional Gaussian features and enables formal recovery guarantees from a single seed. Earlier global attribute-aware methods like CESNA highlighted the practical gains of features but lacked locality and theory; WFD directly addresses this by delivering a simple, scalable local algorithm with statistical guarantees, thereby bridging diffusion/flow-based locality with covariate-informed community modeling.",
