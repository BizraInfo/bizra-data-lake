      "relationship_sentence": "Provides the volitional conception of agency\u2014rooted in reflective endorsement and second\u2011order desires\u2014that the paper uses to argue contemporary AI lacks the kind of will-dependent ethical agency required for personhood."

      "relationship_sentence": "Represents the mechanistic account of artificial moral agents prevalent in AI ethics, serving as the foil the paper critiques as insufficient for ethically significant behavior."

      "relationship_sentence": "Anticipates the paper\u2019s core claim by arguing against granting moral personhood to AI and emphasizing human responsibility by design, which the paper deepens with a political-theoretic grounding."

      "relationship_sentence": "Supplies the institutional lens for shifting from individual (machine) agency to designed group agents, informing the paper\u2019s move to conceive AI outcomes as products of political/institutional processes with tailored accountability mechanisms."

  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014contrasting mechanistic versus volitional agency and rejecting AI personhood in ethically significant contexts while reframing AI as the outcome of political processes\u2014synthesizes strands from philosophy, political theory, and STS. Frankfurt\u2019s account of volitional agency defines personhood through reflective self-governance and second-order volitions, a bar current AI cannot meet. Against this volitional benchmark, Floridi and Sanders\u2019 mechanistic model of artificial moral agency exemplifies a dominant AI-ethics approach that treats systems as agents by virtue of causal roles, which the paper argues is inadequate for ethically weighty judgment. Bryson\u2019s early rejection of robot personhood prefigures the paper\u2019s stance, but the present work extends it by grounding non-personhood not merely in prudential design choices but in a richer theory of agency and responsibility.\nWinner\u2019s thesis that artifacts embody politics enables the shift from anthropomorphic analysis to examining how AI materializes political decisions and power, while List and Pettit\u2019s theory of group agency shows how accountability should be designed into institutions rather than projected onto machines. Bovens supplies the operative framework\u2014forums, standards, and sanctions\u2014for instituting accountability, matching the paper\u2019s call for political mechanisms over ascriptions of machine blame. Finally, Selbst et al.\u2019s sociotechnical critique of abstraction motivates the move beyond agent-centric ethics toward system-level, context-aware analysis. Together, these works directly scaffold the paper\u2019s argument that, for ethically significant behavior, AI should not be treated as an ethical agent but as a politically constituted outcome requiring institutional accountability.",
