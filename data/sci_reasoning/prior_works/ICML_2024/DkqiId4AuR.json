  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014post-hoc characterization and mitigation of failure landscapes in pre-trained discriminative and generative models via deep reinforcement learning and limited human feedback\u2014emerges from two converging threads: automated failure discovery and feedback-driven alignment. On the discovery side, DeepXplore pioneered systematic, coverage-guided testing to expose corner cases, while CheckList emphasized behavioral test design to reveal reliability gaps. The present work generalizes these ideas by using deep RL to actively explore and map a broader, richer \"failure landscape\" across modalities, moving beyond heuristic coverage metrics or manually curated probes. \nOn the mitigation side, Christiano et al.\u2019s preference-based RL and InstructGPT\u2019s scalable RLHF established that small amounts of human feedback can effectively steer model behavior post hoc, a principle further reinforced by Constitutional AI\u2019s low-touch feedback strategies for harmlessness. This paper adapts those insights to shift the model away from discovered failure regions with limited human input, leveraging DRL to couple exploration with alignment. Algorithmically, PPO underpins stable policy improvement during both failure-mode exploration and preference-guided updates. Finally, the robust optimization view of adversarial training from Madry et al. provides the conceptual link between discovering worst-case failures and training to be resilient against them; here, adversarial examples are replaced by RL-discovered failure modes, and the mitigation is executed post hoc with human feedback. Together, these strands yield a unified, scalable approach for discovering and fading failures across CV, NLP, and VLM systems.",
