  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014counterfactual evaluation of peer-review assignment policies under support violations using partial identification\u2014sits at the intersection of OPE, partial identification, and peer-review assignment. Foundational OPE work by Dud\u00edk, Langford, and Li, and by Swaminathan and Joachims established IPS/DR estimators and counterfactual risk minimization with logged propensities, framing reviewer assignment evaluation as an off-policy problem. However, as Rosenbaum and Rubin emphasized, positivity (overlap) is essential; in peer-review, structural constraints and policy design yield zero-propensity regions, making unbiased point estimation infeasible.\n\nTo bridge this gap, the paper draws on partial identification ideas pioneered by Manski and Pepper, leveraging monotonicity to derive credible bounds rather than point estimates. Complementing monotonicity, Slivkins\u2019 contextual bandits with similarity information motivate a Lipschitz smoothness assumption: outcomes should vary smoothly with reviewer\u2013paper similarity, enabling tighter bounds when direct observations are absent.\n\nOn the domain side, TPMS (Charlin & Zemel) and subsequent learning-to-match methods (Stelmakh, Shah, Singh) provide the covariate and similarity frameworks that make the monotone/Lipschitz structural assumptions meaningful in peer review. Together, these strands enable the paper to exploit randomized peer-review logs as bandit feedback, confront overlap failures head-on via partial identification, and furnish practically informative bounds on the quality impact of counterfactual assignment policies.",
