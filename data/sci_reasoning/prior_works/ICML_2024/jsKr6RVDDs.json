  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of this paper is to ground claims about dataset \u201cdiversity\u201d in explicit measurement theory and to evaluate such claims empirically across many datasets. This move draws directly on foundational social science sources. Stevens\u2019 typology of measurement scales establishes the need to align operations with construct meaning, while Cronbach and Meehl\u2019s construct validity framework provides the conceptualize\u2013operationalize\u2013validate pipeline that the paper explicitly adapts for ML datasets. On the ML side, widely adopted documentation efforts\u2014Datasheets for Datasets, Data Statements, and the Dataset Nutrition Label\u2014normalized reporting of properties like diversity and demographics but left open how to define, operationalize, and validate these constructs. The present work identifies that gap and extends these templates by insisting on validated indicators and empirical checks, rather than unsubstantiated descriptors. Empirical evidence of representational harms, crystallized by Gender Shades, provides the motivating case that diversity must be measured, not merely asserted, because unrepresentative data can drive systematic failures. Finally, Torralba and Efros\u2019s demonstration that datasets encode systematic biases offers a lineage of quantifying dataset properties; the current paper reframes that tradition to focus on diversity as a contested social construct that demands principled measurement. Together, these works directly enable the paper\u2019s central contribution: importing rigorous measurement principles into dataset curation and documentation, and auditing existing claims to make diversity a testable, validated property.",
