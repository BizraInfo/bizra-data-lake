  "synthesis_narrative": "CAT3D reframes 3D asset creation as simulating a real capture: generate a dense, pose-controlled set of novel views with a multi-view diffusion model, then hand these to a robust 3D reconstructor. This pipeline stands on two pillars. First, the reconstruction side is grounded in NeRF-style methods\u2014NeRF and its robust successors Mip-NeRF 360 and Zip-NeRF\u2014which demonstrate that high-quality 3D emerges reliably from many well-posed views. For speed and deployment, 3D Gaussian Splatting provides the real-time training and rendering engine that turns CAT3D\u2019s generated views into interactive assets within minutes.\nOn the generative side, CAT3D builds on camera-conditioned generative modeling. EG3D established the value of explicit camera conditioning and enforcing multi-view consistency in generative models. Zero-1-to-3 brought this idea into diffusion-based, image-conditioned novel view synthesis, showing that a single input can guide pose-conditioned generation. CAT3D extends these ideas to produce many strongly consistent novel views across arbitrary target cameras and variable numbers of inputs, effectively simulating dense capture.\nFinally, DreamFusion showed that 2D diffusion priors can supervise 3D but also highlighted instability and geometric artifacts of score-distillation optimization. CAT3D avoids those pitfalls by decoupling generation and reconstruction: it uses a multi-view diffusion model to create view-consistent images first, then leverages mature, robust 3D reconstruction to obtain accurate, real-time 3D scenes.",
