  "synthesis_narrative": "GaLore\u2019s central idea\u2014low-rank projection of per-layer gradients to shrink optimizer-state memory while preserving full-parameter training\u2014sits at the intersection of low-rank update structure and memory-efficient optimization. LoRA established the effectiveness of low-rank mechanisms for LLMs but highlighted a key drawback: constraining parameters to a low-rank subspace can hurt performance. GaLore inverts this trade-off by keeping full-parameter weights and projecting only gradients, guided by evidence that model updates often inhabit low-dimensional subspaces, as shown by Aghajanyan et al.\nPowerSGD provides the most direct algorithmic precursor, demonstrating that gradients are amenable to low-rank approximation via power iteration. GaLore repurposes this from reducing communication to reducing memory, storing optimizer moments in the compact subspace. Efficient, frequently refreshed subspaces in GaLore are enabled by randomized low-rank range-finding techniques formalized by Halko\u2013Martinsson\u2013Tropp.\nOn the memory front, GaLore complements established baselines. Adafactor reduces memory by factoring second moments; 8-bit optimizers reduce precision to shrink state size; and ZeRO partitions optimizer states across devices. In contrast, GaLore reduces the intrinsic dimensionality of the states via low-rank coordinates and can potentially compose with quantization or partitioning for additive gains. Collectively, these works shaped GaLore\u2019s design: adopt low-rank where the signal lies (gradients), use randomized low-rank methods to keep it efficient and adaptive, and target the dominant memory bottleneck\u2014optimizer states\u2014without sacrificing the benefits of full-parameter training.",
