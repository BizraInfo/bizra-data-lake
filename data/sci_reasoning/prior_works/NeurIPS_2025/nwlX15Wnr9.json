  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s main contribution\u2014showing that incentive-compatible exploration in high-dimensional linear contexts can be made sample-efficient under mild geometric conditions\u2014sits at the intersection of incentive design and linear bandit geometry. The incentivized exploration lineage of Kremer\u2013Mansour\u2013Perry (2014) and Mansour\u2013Slivkins\u2013Syrgkanis (2015) provides the principal\u2013agents model and BIC constraints, as well as the crucial procedural insight: once a modest amount of unbiased data is amassed, one can implement posterior-sampling-style recommendations that are both incentive compatible and near-optimal. The present work targets exactly this warm-start bottleneck.\nOn the statistical side, Rusmevichientong\u2013Tsitsiklis (2010) and Abbasi-Yadkori\u2013P\u00e1l\u2013Szepesv\u00e1ri (2011) supply the linear bandit machinery\u2014self-normalized concentration and design-matrix conditioning\u2014that quantify how action-set geometry governs estimation accuracy. Soare\u2013Lazaric\u2013Munos (2014) further crystallizes this via an experimental-design lens, showing that well-conditioned (isotropic) action sets admit polynomial sample complexity. Leveraging these geometric principles, the new paper identifies Euclidean-ball actions as a regime where IC does not force information-sparse choices, enabling a polynomial-size warm start. Finally, Abeille\u2013Lazaric (2017) ensures that, once this warm start is achieved, linear Thompson sampling delivers near-optimal regret. Throughout, Bayesian persuasion (Kamenica\u2013Gentzkow, 2011) underpins the information-design aspects that keep recommendations incentive compatible. Together, these works directly enable the paper\u2019s central result: geometry can reconcile incentive constraints with statistically efficient exploration.",
