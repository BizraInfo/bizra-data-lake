  "synthesis_narrative": "Flow Matching for Generative Modeling introduced simulation-free training of continuous-time generative flows by regressing a model velocity field to an analytically defined target field along a coupling path, establishing a practical alternative to simulating SDEs. Stochastic Flow Matching extended this idea by using stochastic interpolants to learn SDE dynamics directly from conditional velocity regression without simulating the stochastic process. Rectified Flow showed that choosing OT-inspired straight-line paths greatly simplifies training and stabilizes learned dynamics, highlighting the advantage of displacement interpolation as a target reference. On the geometric side, Denoising Diffusion on Riemannian Manifolds formalized how to construct noise processes and scores intrinsically on manifolds such as Lie groups, while Riemannian Continuous Normalizing Flows provided a principled framework for defining and integrating ODE vector fields constrained to a manifold. In protein design, RFdiffusion and Diffusion Probabilistic Modeling of Protein Backbones in 3D established SE(3)-aware backbone generation with diffusion, but required costly SDE simulation and iterative denoising.\nCombining these insights revealed a clear opportunity: use flow matching\u2019s simulation-free velocity regression on the appropriate manifold, while adopting OT-style reference paths to simplify learning, for SE(3)-equivariant protein backbone generation. The resulting synthesis naturally employs Riemannian CNF mechanics to keep dynamics on SE(3), leverages manifold diffusion theory to define noise and geodesics, generalizes rectified, OT-inspired path choices to Riemannian settings, and extends SFM to learn stochastic SE(3) dynamics\u2014all to match or surpass diffusion baselines without simulation overhead.",

Toward this goal, we introduce \\foldflow, a series of novel generative models of increasing modeling power based on the flow-matching paradigm over $3\\mathrm{D}$ rigid motions---i.e. the group $\\mathrm{SE(3)}$---enabling accurate modeling of protein backbones. We first introduce $\\text{FoldFlow-Base}$, a simulation-free approach to learning deterministic continuous-time dynamics and matching invariant target distributions on $\\mathrm{SE(3)}$. We next accelerate training by incorporating Riemannian optimal transport to create $\\text{FoldFlow-OT}$, leading to the construction of both more simple and stable flows. Finally, we design \\foldflowsfm, coupling both Riemannian OT and simulation-free training to learn stochastic continuous-time dynamics over $\\mathrm{SE(3)}$. Our family of $\\text{FoldFlow}$, generative models offers several key advantages over previous approa",
