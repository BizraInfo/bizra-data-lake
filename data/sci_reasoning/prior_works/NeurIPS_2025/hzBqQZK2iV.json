  "synthesis_narrative": "Uni-LoRA\u2019s key contribution is to unify and extend parameter-efficient LoRA variants by recasting their trainable spaces as projections from a compact subspace. This builds directly on LoRA\u2019s core idea of constraining updates to a low-rank manifold, but reframes all LoRA parameters across layers as a single flattened vector recoverable via a projection P from R^d to R^D. Works like Tied-LoRA and VeRA provided the immediate predecessors: Tied-LoRA\u2019s cross-layer tying becomes a specific structural constraint on P, while VeRA explicitly parameterizes updates as projecting a task vector through a fixed/random basis, an exact instance of the Uni-LoRA projection view. VB-LoRA contributes the latent-variable perspective, which in Uni-LoRA corresponds to choosing a low-dimensional latent and its associated projection into the LoRA space. This projection-based lens is theoretically motivated by intrinsic-dimension results showing that effective fine-tuning lives in surprisingly low-dimensional subspaces, indicating that d << D can suffice. Methodologically, it resonates with HyperNetworks and Compacter, which generate many weights from compact representations and shared low-rank components, respectively\u2014both interpretable as learned or structured projections shared across layers. Uni-LoRA crystallizes these threads by identifying the choice of P as the fundamental differentiator among methods and pushes efficiency further by enabling extreme cross-layer sharing\u2014up to a single vector\u2014without sacrificing expressivity.",
