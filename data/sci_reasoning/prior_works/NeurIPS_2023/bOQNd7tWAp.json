  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s key contribution is to recast meta-optimization\u2014selecting hyperparameters or even whole optimizers\u2014as an optimal control problem and to secure regret guarantees via convex relaxations from the nonstochastic control literature. Prior meta-optimization methods, including hypergradient descent (Baydin et al., 2017) and learned optimizers (Andrychowicz et al., 2016), established practical mechanisms for adapting learning rules but typically offer local or heuristic guarantees due to inherent nonconvexity. In contrast, Lessard, Recht, and Packard (2016) showed how control theory can analyze optimization algorithms through stability (IQC) arguments; this work departs from stability analysis toward designing algorithms via optimal control with performance guarantees. The direct enabler is the nonstochastic control framework (Hazan, Kakade, Singh, 2020), which develops convex relaxations and online-regret analyses against the best offline controller under adversarial disturbances\u2014precisely the paradigm the current paper adapts to the meta-optimization setting to bypass nonconvexity and compete with the best offline optimizer. System Level Synthesis (Wang, Matni, Doyle, 2019) contributes the idea that appropriate controller parameterizations yield convex design problems, informing the paper\u2019s relaxation strategy when searching over optimization algorithms. Finally, bilevel hyperparameter optimization (Franceschi et al., 2018) clarifies the limitations of gradient-based bilevel approaches for global guarantees, sharpening the motivation for a control-theoretic, regret-minimizing formulation. Together, these works directly shape the paper\u2019s reframing of meta-optimization as online optimal control with provable regret.",
