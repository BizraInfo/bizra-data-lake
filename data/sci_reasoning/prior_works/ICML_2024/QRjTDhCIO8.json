  "synthesis_narrative": "Re-Dock\u2019s core innovation\u2014flexible docking via a diffusion bridge on geometric manifolds with an energy-to-geometry coupling\u2014emerges from converging lines of prior work. DiffDock established the feasibility of diffusion models for docking but assumed rigid receptors and mostly holo pockets; Re-Dock upgrades this paradigm to a conditional bridge that transports from apo to bound states while co-sampling ligand pose and pocket sidechains. Earlier geometric baselines like EquiBind, and energy-aware cross-docking systems like TANKBind, exposed the key practical gap\u2014neglect of receptor flexibility\u2014which Re-Dock tackles head-on by modeling sidechain torsions during pose generation. Methodologically, the ability to operate natively on rotations and torsions is grounded in Riemannian score-based generative modeling, which formalizes diffusion and score estimation on manifolds such as SO(3) and tori. Building on this foundation, torsional diffusion for molecular conformers provided concrete mechanisms for angular noise processes and denoising on periodic spaces; Re-Dock extends these mechanisms to protein sidechains and integrates them with ligand SE(3) updates. Finally, Schr\u00f6dinger-bridge formulations supply the conditional generation framework that allows Re-Dock to model realistic apo-to-holo transitions. Together, these works directly shape Re-Dock\u2019s design: a manifold-aware diffusion bridge that unifies ligand pose, sidechain flexibility, and an energy-to-geometry mapping inspired by Newton\u2013Euler dynamics to produce realistic, energy-consistent docking outcomes.",
