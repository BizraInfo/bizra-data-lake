  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of UPCL is to unify multi-modal (e.g., RGB/IR) and multi-task (person and vehicle) ReID through unbiased prototype consistency. Foundationally, SYSU-MM01 formalized the RGB\u2013IR gap, crystallizing the need to explicitly mitigate modality distribution divergence. SpCL then demonstrated that cluster-driven prototypes and memory banks stabilize identity-discriminative learning in ReID, while SwAV established the value of prototype/cluster assignment consistency across views. UPCL fuses these prototype-centric ideas but tailors them to supervised/weakly-supervised ReID with modality-aware, category-aware prototypes that must remain consistent across modalities and tasks.\nA second pillar is debiasing: Debiased Contrastive Learning revealed how sampling bias and false negatives degrade contrastive objectives. UPCL applies analogous principles to prototype construction and contrastive pairing, counteracting biases introduced by heterogeneous modalities and disparate category semantics. At the systems level, mainstream ReID training practices (Bag of Tricks) ensure that UPCL integrates seamlessly with proven ID/metric losses. Finally, broader advances in unified multi-modal/multi-task representation learning (Uni-Perceiver) and cross-modal alignment (CLIP) motivate UPCL\u2019s single-model ambition: a modality-agnostic, task-agnostic embedding that preserves identity discrimination. Together, these works directly inform UPCL\u2019s Unbiased Prototypes-guided Modality Enhancement and cluster/prototype consistency design, yielding a scalable solution to M^3T-ReID.",
