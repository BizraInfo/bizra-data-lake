  "synthesis_narrative": "DICEPTION\u2019s core insight\u2014repurposing a single, pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model as a compute- and data-efficient generalist perception engine\u2014rests on three converging lines of prior work. First, Latent Diffusion Models established an efficient, text-conditioned U-Net in latent space that encodes broad visual priors learned at web scale; this provides the rich foundation DICEPTION seeks to preserve. Second, a body of parameter-efficient adaptation techniques shows how to inject new capabilities without catastrophic forgetting: ControlNet demonstrates adding a zero-initialized, trainable control branch while keeping the original diffusion weights intact; adapter-tuning and LoRA formalize small, targeted parameter updates that minimally disturb pre-trained knowledge. These methods directly inspire DICEPTION\u2019s architecture and training regime centered on knowledge preservation under limited compute/data. Third, diffusion\u2019s applicability to perception is evidenced by task formulations and input paradigms: DiffusionDet recasts object detection as denoising, validating diffusion backbones for discriminative tasks, while RePaint\u2019s masked conditioning clarifies how to encode spatial constraints and prompts\u2014mechanisms DICEPTION generalizes across segmentation, detection, and other dense predictions. Finally, SAM defines the promptable segmentation interface and a specialist performance yardstick; matching SAM-like quality with orders-of-magnitude fewer pixel-level labels motivates DICEPTION\u2019s generalist approach. Together, these works directly shape DICEPTION\u2019s design choices\u2014frozen latent diffusion priors, parameter-efficient adapters/control branches, and carefully crafted task inputs\u2014enabling strong multi-task perception with low training cost.",
