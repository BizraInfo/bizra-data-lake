  "synthesis_narrative": "The core innovation of this paper is a mutual-information\u2013based, label-channel view that uniformly treats two extremes of inexact supervision: redundant candidate labels (partial labels) and insufficient labels (unlabeled data). The intellectual lineage starts with Cour et al. (2011), which established the partial-label formulation and the central challenge of disambiguating candidate label sets. Building on this, PRODEN (Lv et al., 2020) introduced progressive identification via soft reweighting within candidate sets; the new paper directly extends this idea by formalizing reweighting as information exchange through a label channel, enabling the same mechanism to operate when labels are absent. This channel perspective is inspired by Label Distribution Learning (Geng, 2016), which models supervision as a soft distribution over labels\u2014here instantiated as dynamic probability flow among candidate labels to isolate the true one and suppress others. On the insufficiency side, classic pseudo-labeling (Lee, 2013) and modern SSL baselines such as FixMatch (Sohn et al., 2020) provide the operative principle of converting model confidence into supervision; the proposed MI criterion subsumes these strategies while remaining consistent with the partial-label case. Finally, works like PiCO (2022) illustrate composite PLL pipelines the paper critiques; by reframing both redundancy and insufficiency as mutual-information transmission through a noisy label channel, the paper replaces ad hoc combinations with a single, principled objective.",
