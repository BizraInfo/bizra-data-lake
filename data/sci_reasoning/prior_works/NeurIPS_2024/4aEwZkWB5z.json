  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core advance\u2014an efficient learner for \u03b3-margin halfspaces under Massart noise with sample complexity \u00d5(1/(\u03b3^2 \u03b5^2))\u2014sits at the confluence of three streams. First, margin-based capacity control, as developed by Bartlett and Shawe-Taylor, sets the information-theoretic target of \u00d5(1/(\u03b3^2 \u03b5)) samples. Second, the Massart/low-noise literature (Massart\u2013N\u00e9d\u00e9lec; Audibert\u2013Tsybakov) and the calibration theory for convex surrogates (Zhang; Bartlett\u2013Jordan\u2013McAuliffe) provide the statistical mechanism to turn optimization progress on convex losses into fast-rate excess risk bounds and \u03b7+\u03b5 0\u20131 error. These foundations justify the paper\u2019s choice of convex losses and enable tight surrogate-to-classification error transfer.\n\nThird, on the algorithmic side, Awasthi\u2013Balcan\u2013Long\u2019s localization framework for noisy halfspaces demonstrated that staged optimization of convex surrogates can be computationally practical, but incurred a sample complexity scaling of roughly 1/(\u03b3^4 \u03b5^3). The present work refines this paradigm: it employs a carefully scheduled sequence of convex losses and runs simple online SGD with an analysis tuned to Massart fast rates, thereby shaving a factor of 1/(\u03b3\u03b5) and achieving the near-optimal \u00d5(1/(\u03b3^2 \u03b5^2)) dependence. Complementing this, the Massart-halfspace line under the uniform distribution (Diakonikolas\u2013Kane\u2013Stewart) both supplied practical algorithmic principles and SQ lower-bound evidence of an information\u2013computation tradeoff suggesting a quadratic 1/\u03b5 term may be unavoidable for efficient procedures. Together, these prior works directly shape the new algorithm\u2019s design (localized convex optimization via SGD) and its near-optimal statistical guarantees.",
