  "synthesis_narrative": "Nest and Ernoult\u2019s core contribution is a principled training rule for feedforward-tied Energy-based Models (ff-EBMs) that combine digital feedforward blocks with analog energy-based blocks. The hybrid gradient method backpropagates through the digital modules and \u201ceq-propagates\u201d through the analog ones, enabling end-to-end learning on heterogeneous hardware. This synthesis stands on three intellectual pillars. First, Equilibrium Propagation (Scellier & Bengio) and its lineage from contrastive Hebbian learning (Xie & Seung) provide the local, two-phase dynamics and gradient identities used inside analog energy-based blocks. Second, classic results on differentiating through equilibria, notably recurrent backpropagation (Pineda), and modern implicit-layer formulations such as Deep Equilibrium Models (Bai et al.) establish how equilibrium-defined modules can be composed in larger networks with chain-rule-compatible gradients. Third, the energy-based learning framework (LeCun et al.) supplies the modeling formalism for defining the analog blocks\u2019 energies and objectives.\nCrucially, the paper is motivated by the realities of analog accelerators like ISAAC, which embed digital logic for memory movement, calibration, and control. Prior EP-in-hardware work (e.g., Laborieux et al.) demonstrates EP\u2019s practicality in physical dynamics, but lacked a unified training theory for mixed analog\u2013digital pipelines. By integrating EP-style local credit assignment with standard backprop across module boundaries, this work provides the missing algorithmic glue to train digitally tied analog blocks end-to-end, aligning theoretical learning rules with the constraints and advantages of heterogeneous neuromorphic systems.",
