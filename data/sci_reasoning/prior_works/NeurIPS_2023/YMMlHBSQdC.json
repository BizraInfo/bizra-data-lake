  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper explains why robust models exhibit perceptually-aligned gradients (PAGs) by introducing off-manifold robustness and proving it drives input gradients to lie approximately on the data manifold. This builds directly on three empirical pillars: (1) robust training alters feature usage toward human-aligned signals (Ilyas et al., 2019), (2) gradients of robust classifiers enable generative behaviors like synthesis and denoising (Santurkar et al., 2019), and (3) robustness correlates with interpretable, human-perceptual saliency maps (Etmann et al., 2019). To connect these observations with mechanism, the authors leverage the on-manifold vs off-manifold distinction formalized by Stutz et al. (2019), positing that greater robustness away from the data manifold induces gradients that are tangent to (and thus perceptually aligned with) the manifold.\nMethodologically, the work evaluates families of models whose training is known or designed to enhance robustness: gradient-norm regularization (Ross & Doshi-Velez, 2018) and randomized smoothing (Cohen et al., 2019). These provide concrete testbeds to confirm that when off-manifold robustness is enforced, gradients align with perceptual structure and confer generative utility. Finally, theoretical precedents analyzing robust Bayes decision rules in stylized distributions (Schmidt et al., 2018) motivate the paper\u2019s proof that Bayes-optimal classifiers satisfy off-manifold robustness, linking optimal decision boundaries to manifold-aligned gradients. Together, these works culminate in a unifying explanation: robustness that is stronger off the data manifold is the common cause behind PAGs and the emergent generative behaviors of robust vision models.",
