  "synthesis_narrative": "GMAIL\u2019s core idea\u2014treating generated images as a distinct modality and aligning them with real images in a shared latent space\u2014sits at the intersection of multimodal representation learning and domain adaptation. Classic multimodal learning (Ngiam et al.) established that heterogeneous data sources can share a joint representation, a principle operationalized at scale by CLIP\u2019s contrastive alignment between images and text. GMAIL inherits this alignment philosophy but repurposes it to bridge two visual modalities: real and synthetic images. The choice of a contrastive alignment loss draws on InfoNCE from CPC, providing a well-founded objective to pull semantically corresponding samples together across modalities.\n\nFrom the domain adaptation side, DAN and DANN demonstrated that reducing domain discrepancy in deep feature spaces\u2014via MMD-based matching or adversarial invariance\u2014improves transfer. GMAIL adapts this feature-space alignment mindset to the specific real\u2013synthetic gap, using a targeted cross-modality loss rather than pixel-level tricks. In contrast to image translation approaches like CyCADA, which seek to map between domains in pixel space, GMAIL avoids potential distributional artifacts by aligning at the representation level. Finally, CoGAN\u2019s concept of a shared latent code across domains reinforces GMAIL\u2019s design of a common latent manifold where generated and real images are coherently tied. Together, these works directly inform GMAIL\u2019s two-stage strategy: first align a model on generated data with a cross-modality objective, then exploit the aligned latent space to effectively train downstream vision-language models with synthetic imagery.",
