  "synthesis_narrative": "Prompt Diffusion\u2019s central contribution\u2014bringing in-context learning to diffusion models with a unified vision\u2013language prompt\u2014sits at the intersection of in-context reasoning and conditional image generation. GPT-3 introduced the core paradigm of in-context learning, showing that tasks can be specified at inference time by demonstrations rather than parameter updates. Flamingo extended this idea to the multimodal regime, demonstrating that interleaved image\u2013text exemplars and cross-attention can elicit few-shot capabilities; Prompt Diffusion adopts a similar prompt structure, but targets generative image transformations rather than language outputs.\nOn the generative side, Latent Diffusion Models supplied the practical backbone\u2014latent-space denoising with cross-attention\u2014that Prompt Diffusion augments to ingest composite prompts comprising example input\u2013output image pairs plus text. Palette established that a single diffusion model can be trained across diverse image-to-image tasks, a key feasibility result that Prompt Diffusion generalizes by inferring the task from in-context examples instead of relying on explicit task identifiers. In parallel, ControlNet demonstrated that structured visual conditions (e.g., edges, depth, scribbles) can reliably steer generation; Prompt Diffusion subsumes such controls by learning to parse paired exemplars of these modalities within its prompt. Finally, CLIP furnishes the vision\u2013language alignment necessary to mix natural-language guidance with visual cues, while classifier-free guidance provides a robust mechanism to enforce adherence to this composite conditioning during sampling. Together, these works directly scaffold Prompt Diffusion\u2019s design and make in-context, task-general image generation possible.",
