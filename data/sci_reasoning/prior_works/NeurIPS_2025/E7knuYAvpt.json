  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s central advance\u2014iterative polynomial filtering for supervised learning under contamination\u2014sits at the intersection of robust estimation, polynomial approximation, and noise models. The filtering backbone originates in high-dimensional robust estimation (Diakonikolas et al. 2016), where iterative removal using low-degree moment tests achieves provable robustness under Huber-style contamination. Heavy-contamination feasibility and algorithmic structure come from the list-decodable line (Charikar\u2013Steinhardt\u2013Valiant 2017; Diakonikolas\u2013Kane\u2013Stewart 2019), which showed that learning is possible even when a majority of the data are adversarial, but largely for mean/regression; the present work generalizes these guarantees to broad supervised tasks by designing polynomial filters tied to function-class approximability.\nCrucially, the noise-model lineage (Kearns\u2013Li 1993) frames the bounded/nasty contamination regime in which the paper proves that low-degree polynomial approximability\u2014previously associated mainly with classification-noise resilience (Angluin\u2013Laird 1988)\u2014actually suffices for efficient learning under adversarial sample corruptions. This conceptual leap is enabled by importing the sandwiching approximator toolkit (Diakonikolas et al. 2010), giving upper/lower polynomial surrogates whose expectations can be tightly controlled even amidst heavy additive contamination, thereby yielding near-optimal guarantees. Finally, hypercontractivity and invariance principles (Mossel\u2013O\u2019Donnell\u2013Oleszkiewicz 2005) provide the moment control and concentration necessary for the polynomial tests to be both analyzable and effective under the assumed distributions. Together, these strands directly inform the algorithmic design, the regimes addressed (bounded and heavy contamination), and the proof techniques that certify the paper\u2019s robust learning guarantees.",
