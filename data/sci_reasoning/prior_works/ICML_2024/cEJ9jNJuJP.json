  "synthesis_narrative": "The ICML 2024 position paper targets a specific modern recipe for large-scale TSP\u2014learn a heatmap over edges and couple it with a post-hoc search procedure (MCTS)\u2014and asks whether the learned heatmap truly provides actionable guidance beyond classical heuristics. This paradigm has two intellectual roots. First, the neural-CO wave established by Bello et al. seeded the notion of post-hoc search-augmented neural solvers, while Kool et al. made high-quality probabilistic policies practical for routing at scale. Joshi et al. then crystallized the exact artifact under scrutiny\u2014a supervised edge-inclusion probability heatmap\u2014making \u201cedge heatmaps\u201d a standard interface between learning and search. Second, AlphaZero showed how learned priors can drive MCTS effectively, a template that many TSP works instantiated as heatmap-guided tree search. In parallel, NeuroLKH demonstrated how learned edge priors can be injected into a powerful handcrafted solver, epitomizing the broader class of post-hoc, problem-specific neural guidance that the paper argues remains brittle. Against this backdrop, the authors benchmark the heatmap+MCTS paradigm directly against LKH-3 and find it lacking, and further show that a simple non-ML baseline can outperform complex heatmap models. The combined lineage therefore directly motivates their thesis: the community\u2019s reliance on learned edge heatmaps and post-hoc search has outpaced rigorous validation, and future work should pursue theoretically grounded heatmaps and more autonomous, generalizable ML approaches that can genuinely rival LKH-3.",
