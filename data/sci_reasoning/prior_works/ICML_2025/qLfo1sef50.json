  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014policy-labeled preference learning (PPL) within DPO\u2014arises from reconciling preference-based RLHF with the realities of off-policy, non-optimal data. Christiano et al. (2017) established the RLHF paradigm of learning from pairwise preferences over trajectory segments, typically instantiated with Bradley\u2013Terry likelihoods. However, these likelihoods implicitly presume optimal or policy-agnostic data generation, creating a mismatch in offline or evolving-policy regimes. PPL directly addresses this by modifying the Bradley\u2013Terry/DPO contrastive likelihood to condition on the generating policy\u2019s efficiency through regret, thereby calibrating preference probabilities to the quality of the executed policy.\n\nDPO provides the operational scaffold: a simple, stable, contrastive policy objective derived from preferences. PPL extends DPO\u2019s formulation with policy labels and introduces a regret-derived, contrastive KL term. This design draws on KL-regularized policy optimization foundations popularized by PPO in RLHF pipelines, but grounds the regularizer in regret so that it is sequence- and policy-aware rather than a uniform trust region. Conceptually, PPL\u2019s treatment of suboptimality echoes MaxEnt IRL\u2019s principled modeling of non-optimal behavior, replacing brittle optimality assumptions with probabilistic structure tied to regret. Finally, the continuous-control preference literature (Akrour et al.) informs the trajectory-level and offline setting that PPL targets, showing how preference-based learning scales beyond discrete tokens. Together, these strands yield a regret-aware, contrastive preference objective that corrects likelihood mismatch and empirically improves offline and online RLHF in high-dimensional control.",
