  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014showing when fully parameter-free stochastic optimization is achievable and when it is provably impossible\u2014builds on three strands of prior work. First, it targets the tuned nonconvex rates of stochastic gradient methods established by Ghadimi and Lan, using those as the benchmark to match without prior knowledge of problem parameters. Second, it borrows the central idea behind multi-rate and hyperparameter-search methodologies: run a portfolio of learning rates and allocate computation adaptively. Here, the inspiration comes both from MetaGrad\u2019s multi\u2013learning-rate aggregation in online learning and from resource-efficient hyperparameter search methods like Hyperband/successive halving. The paper instantiates a particularly simple search procedure over step sizes that, in the nonconvex setting, attains the same guarantees as optimally tuned SGD while requiring no parameter inputs. Third, in the convex setting with access to noisy function values, the work leverages the gradient-free smoothing/estimation frameworks of Flaxman\u2013Kalai\u2013McMahan and Nesterov\u2013Spokoiny, and shows that the same search principle can remove dependence on unknown smoothness/noise constants while preserving tuned rates. To delineate the frontier of possibility, the paper then adapts the information-theoretic lower-bound machinery of Agarwal\u2013Negahban\u2013Wainwright to demonstrate that fully parameter-free optimization is impossible when restricted to stochastic gradients alone. Together, these influences yield a precise answer to \u201chow free\u201d parameter-free stochastic optimization can be across feedback models.",
