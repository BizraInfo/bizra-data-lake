  "synthesis_narrative": "Spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) became the default way to traverse semantic paths in generative latent spaces after Sampling Generative Networks showed it yields smooth morphs between codes. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models formalized the forward Gaussian corruption and the assumption that the latent noise follows a standard normal distribution, making this distributional prior central to diffusion-based synthesis. Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models introduced a deterministic sampler with a practical inversion procedure, enabling images to be encoded into noise space so that interpolation (often via SLERP) can be performed directly on inverted noises. SDEdit demonstrated that carefully adding Gaussian noise to real inputs can regularize them back onto the score-model manifold, suggesting noise injection as a principled way to improve alignment with the generative process. Meanwhile, Null-Text Inversion revealed the fragility of diffusion inversion for real images\u2014reconstructions drift without tailored procedures\u2014while EDICT pursued exact inversion and highlighted the difficulty of obtaining distribution-consistent inverted latents.\nCollectively, these works laid out a pipeline\u2014encode real images into noise, interpolate in noise, decode\u2014while surfacing a core weakness: inverted noises of natural images often deviate from the assumed Gaussian prior, degrading interpolation. The natural next step is to intervene at the source by repairing the inverted noise itself. Building on DDIM inversion and SLERP\u2019s role, and inspired by SDEdit\u2019s noise-regularization insight, the current work corrects the inverted noise by injecting subtle Gaussian perturbations and suppressing extreme components, restoring validity with respect to the DDPM prior and enabling reliable, high-quality interpolation of real images.",

    "abstract": "Image interpolation based on diffusion models is promising in creating fresh and interesting images. \nAdvanced interpolation methods mainly focus on spherical linear interpolation, where images are encoded into the noise space and then interpolated for denoising to images. \nHowever, existing methods face challenges in effectively interpolating natural images (not generated by diffusion models), thereby restricting their practical applicability. \nOur experimental investigations reveal that these challenges stem from the invalidity of the encoding noise, which may no longer obey the expected noise distribution, e.g., a normal distribution. \nTo address these challenges, we propose a novel approach to correct noise for image interpolation, NoiseDiffusion. Specifically, NoiseDiffusion approaches the invalid noise to the expected distribution by introducing subtle Gaussian noise and introduces a constraint to suppress noise with extreme values. In this context, promoting noise validity contr",
