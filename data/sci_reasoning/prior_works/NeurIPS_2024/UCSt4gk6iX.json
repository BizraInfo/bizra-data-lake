  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core innovation\u2014recasting 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as sampling from a scene distribution via Markov Chain Monte Carlo\u2014stands on two pillars: the 3DGS representation and SG-MCMC theory. Kerbl et al. (2023) provided the core scene parameterization and the widely used cloning/splitting-based densification and pruning heuristics that enable real-time rendering but are initialization-sensitive and hand-engineered. The present work replaces those heuristics by interpreting the Gaussian set as samples from a latent scene distribution and by mapping standard 3DGS gradient updates to Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (Welling & Teh, 2011). This mapping is theoretically grounded by Mandt et al. (2017), which shows that noisy gradient dynamics approximate posterior sampling, thereby motivating calibrated noise injection to reduce dependence on initialization and to encourage exploration of better configurations.\nBeyond turning optimization into sampling, the work must handle a variable number of Gaussians. Green\u2019s Reversible Jump MCMC (1995) provides the trans-dimensional framework, directly inspiring a principled view of densification (birth/split) and pruning (death/merge) as state transitions in a single Markov chain. Jain & Neal\u2019s split-merge MCMC (2004) for mixture models offers concrete analogs to cloning/splitting, guiding the paper\u2019s relocalization move that substitutes heuristic cloning. Finally, Ma, Chen & Fox (2015) supply practical SG-MCMC design rules\u2014noise calibration, preconditioning, and discretization stability\u2014that underpin robust SGLD-style updates for high-dimensional Gaussian parameters. Together, these works enable a coherent probabilistic reinterpretation of 3DGS that removes ad hoc procedures while improving robustness.",
