  "synthesis_narrative": "AbDiffuser\u2019s core innovation\u2014an equivariant, physics-informed diffusion model that jointly generates antibody sequences and full-atom 3D structures\u2014emerges by unifying three strands of prior work. First, the diffusion-based protein design line, epitomized by RFdiffusion, established denoising on residue frames for de novo backbones and binders; AbDiffuser extends this paradigm to an antibody-specific regime with stronger priors and full-atom output. Its equivariant denoising over coordinates is grounded in general SE(3)-equivariant diffusion theory (EDM), which ensures rotational and translational consistency during 3D generation.\nSecond, AbDiffuser\u2019s geometric representation and physics awareness are rooted in AlphaFold\u2019s frame-based modeling and losses (e.g., FAPE and torsion/side-chain handling), enabling stable learning of backbone and rotamers. To make full-atom diffusion practical, AbDiffuser adopts memory-efficient scalar\u2013vector computations inspired by GVP-GNNs, cutting memory while retaining geometric expressiveness necessary for side chain placement.\nThird, antibody-specific alignment and design considerations are crucial. The IMGT numbering canon supplies a universal positional mapping across variable domains, enabling AbDiffuser\u2019s architecture for aligned proteins and facilitating sequence-length changes in CDRs. IgFold contributes antibody-centric structural priors and practical modeling conventions that inform AbDiffuser\u2019s representation and validation. Finally, lessons from ProteinMPNN on conditioning residue identity on local 3D context are integrated directly into AbDiffuser\u2019s joint sequence\u2013structure diffusion, tightening the coupling between geometry and sequence. Collectively, these works directly underpin AbDiffuser\u2019s ability to efficiently generate realistic, in-vitro functioning antibodies with accurate backbones and side chains.",
