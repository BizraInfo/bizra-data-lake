  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s central contribution\u2014identifying compute-optimal training regimes for protein language models and clarifying how model size, token budget, objective, and data diversity interact\u2014rests on two theoretical pillars from NLP and several protein-specific advances. Kaplan et al. introduced universal scaling laws relating loss to parameters and data, motivating a systematic exploration across model sizes and token counts. Hoffmann et al. then reframed this into a compute-optimal recipe (Chinchilla) that prescribes the data\u2013parameter balance for fixed compute; the present work transposes and tests that recipe in the protein domain.\nOn the protein side, Rives et al. (ESM) established masked language modeling on UniRef at scale, showing emergent structural and functional signals\u2014an anchor point this paper revisits by diagnosing overfitting when UniRef is repeatedly cycled. ProtTrans broadened the landscape by showing both MLM and autoregressive objectives and training on vast, diverse corpora (including metagenomic-derived datasets) can be effective, directly informing the head-to-head objective and data diversity analyses here. ProGen provided a clear precedent for causal modeling in proteins, motivating the paper\u2019s CLM scaling and the observed diminishing returns under certain token regimes.\nFinally, resource works like UniRef and MGnify are not merely datasets but methodological choices: the paper\u2019s findings about repetition-induced overfitting and the remedy via metagenomic diversity hinge on these sources. Together, these works enable the authors to quantify a protein-specific efficient compute frontier and to recommend objective\u2013data\u2013scale configurations for training compute-optimal protein LMs.",
