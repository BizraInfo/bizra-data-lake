  "synthesis_narrative": "SimbaV2 targets a central obstacle to scaling deep reinforcement learning: unstable optimization under non-stationary data and varying reward magnitudes. Its architecture fuses two strands of prior work. First, distributional reinforcement learning (Bellemare et al.) and practical quantile-based estimators like IQN showed that modeling the full return distribution yields richer training signals. D4PG extended these ideas to actor\u2013critic in continuous control, demonstrating stability and performance gains. Building on this lineage, SimbaV2 integrates a distributional critic within the Soft Actor-Critic framework, inheriting SAC\u2019s robust off-policy, maximum-entropy foundation while obtaining more stable gradients from a distributional value estimate.\n\nSecond, SimbaV2 addresses scale-related optimization pathologies by controlling feature and parameter norms. The idea of decoupling magnitude from direction in parameters (Salimans & Kingma\u2019s Weight Normalization) and the hyperspherical normalization used in modern classification losses (e.g., ArcFace), where both weights and features are L2-normalized and scaled, directly inform SimbaV2\u2019s hyperspherical normalization. This constrains norm growth, improving conditioning and mitigating instability when models and compute scale up. Complementing this, SimbaV2 introduces reward scaling to stabilize gradients across tasks with disparate reward magnitudes, echoing PopArt\u2019s objective of scale robustness while retaining a simple mechanism compatible with off-policy actor\u2013critic.\n\nTogether, these influences yield a principled combination\u2014SAC + distributional value estimation + hyperspherical normalization + reward scaling\u2014that directly targets the failure modes that typically emerge when scaling deep RL, enabling state-of-the-art performance across diverse continuous control domains.",
