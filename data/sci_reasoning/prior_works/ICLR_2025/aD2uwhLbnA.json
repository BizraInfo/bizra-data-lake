  "synthesis_narrative": "The core contribution\u2014showing that Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) efficiently selects flatter minima when applied only late in training and explaining its two-phase dynamics\u2014sits squarely on the flat-minima paradigm. Hochreiter and Schmidhuber\u2019s flat-minima principle established why wider solutions generalize, while Keskar et al. modernized this insight by linking sharp minima to the generalization gap observed in standard (e.g., large-batch) training. Chaudhari et al.\u2019s Entropy-SGD provided a concrete mechanism\u2014loss smoothing\u2014to bias optimization toward wide valleys and empirically highlighted rapid escape from sharp regions. Foret et al. then introduced SAM, a practical adversarially smoothed objective that became the de facto method for targeting flatness; it is the baseline and mechanism the present work scrutinizes. Two additional strands directly inform the late-phase insight and the within-valley interpretation: Izmailov et al.\u2019s SWA showed that a brief end-of-training procedure can suffice to reach wider optima, motivating the hypothesis that SAM\u2019s benefits might be recoverable with only a few late epochs; and Garipov et al.\u2019s mode connectivity revealed connected valleys between good solutions, supporting the paper\u2019s claim that late-phase SAM rapidly escapes the SGD-found minimum and converges to a flatter point within the same valley. Together, these works directly shape the problem framing, the mechanism (loss smoothing toward flatness), and the late-phase strategy that constitutes this paper\u2019s key innovation.",
