  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014a general framework showing that reduction mappings which reparameterize parameters onto (local) manifolds of solutions sharpen curvature and accelerate gradient-based convergence\u2014builds directly on three intertwined lines of work. First, classical variable projection (Golub & Pereyra) established that eliminating nuisance variables via inner optimization yields a reduced objective with superior conditioning. The present work abstracts this idea beyond separable least squares, treating broad inner problems and rigorously quantifying how such reductions strengthen curvature. Second, geometric optimization on manifolds (Absil\u2013Mahony\u2013Sepulchre; Bonnabel) provides the machinery for projecting gradients/Hessians onto tangent spaces and analyzing convergence when dynamics are restricted to a manifold. The authors leverage this lens to show that removing redundant directions (symmetries, over-parameterized nullspaces) exposes a better-conditioned tangent-space Hessian, thereby improving rates. Closely related, quotient-manifold treatments of factorizations (Mishra et al.) demonstrate how collapsing equivalence classes eliminates flat directions\u2014precisely the effect engineered by the proposed reductions. Third, identification theory (Hare & Lewis) and PL-based rate results (Karimi\u2013Nutini\u2013Schmidt) connect structural knowledge at optimality to provably faster local convergence. The paper unifies these themes: reductions that identify and parameterize the optimality manifold increase gradient-dominance/curvature constants for the reduced problem, yielding sharper (often linear) convergence guarantees for standard gradient methods. Conceptually, this also resonates with Amari\u2019s natural gradient: both remove parameterization-induced redundancy to improve conditioning, though here via explicit reduction mappings.",
