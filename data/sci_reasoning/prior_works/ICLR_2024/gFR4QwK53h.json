  "synthesis_narrative": "Pearl\u2019s treatment of selection bias formalizes how conditioning on or selecting by certain variables can preserve or distort conditional independences, offering graphical criteria to reason about when CI relations remain valid after case deletion. Mohan, Pearl, and Tian\u2019s missingness graphs crystalize the idea that one should model the measurement/missingness mechanism causally, with explicit response indicators that determine whether values are observed, thereby enabling identification arguments about statistical relationships under missingness. Bareinboim, Tian, and Pearl provide recoverability conditions under selection, clarifying when target quantities (including independence relations) are preserved despite biased sampling. In parallel, Kharchenko et al. (SCDE) introduced a mechanistic view of scRNA-seq dropouts where the probability of observing a zero depends on the unobserved true expression, establishing a concrete, biologically motivated dropout mechanism. On the practice side, scImpute and MAGIC typify the prevailing imputation-first responses to zeros in single-cell data, replacing missing/zero entries with model-based estimates or diffusion-smoothed values, which can alter the joint distribution and inflate spurious dependencies.\nSynthesizing these threads, the opportunity emerges to treat scRNA-seq zeros as outcomes of a causal measurement process and to reason about their impact on CI via selection/missingness graphs rather than imputation. By viewing deletion of samples with zeros in conditioned variables as a specific selection operation sanctioned by the graphical criteria of Pearl and Bareinboim, and grounding the dropout mechanism in SCDE-style assumptions, the paper shows that the true CIs are recoverable without imputation. This directly enables constraint-based causal/GRN discovery to proceed on zero-inflated single-cell data with nonparametric CI tests, aligning with the CPS framework while avoiding the joint-distribution distortions of imputation.",

    "abstract": "Gene regulatory network inference (GRNI) is a challenging problem, particularly owing to the presence of zeros in single-cell RNA sequencing data: some are biological zeros representing no gene expression, while some others are technical zeros arising from the sequencing procedure (aka dropouts), which may bias GRNI by distorting the joint distribution of the measured gene expressions. Existing approaches typically handle dropout error via imputation, which may introduce spurious relations as the true joint distribution is generally unidentifiable. To tackle this issue, we introduce a causal graphical model to characterize the dropout mechanism, namely, Causal Dropout Model. We provide a simple yet effective theoretical result: interestingly, the conditional independence (CI) relations in the data with dropouts, after deleting the samples with zero values (regardless if technical or not) for the conditioned variables, are asymptotically identical to the CI relations in the original dat",
