  "synthesis_narrative": "The core idea behind \u201cNavigating Semantic Drift in Task-Agnostic Class-Incremental Learning\u201d is to view forgetting through the lens of moment shifts in the feature space and then explicitly calibrate those shifts. This begins with the nearest class mean lineage: Mensink et al. established class means as compact, incrementally updatable statistics, and iCaRL embedded that principle into exemplar-based CIL with nearest-mean classification. However, these methods do not model how class means move and covariances deform as new tasks arrive, especially when task IDs are unknown. Prior attempts to curb representation drift, such as PODNet\u2019s pooled feature distillation, revealed the problem but treated it indirectly. The authors instead borrow from domain adaptation\u2019s moment alignment: Deep CORAL showed that covariance alignment can effectively reduce distribution shift, suggesting second-order statistics as a control knob. Complementing this, Lee et al.\u2019s Mahalanobis framework grounded the use of class-conditional Gaussian assumptions and distances that are sensitive to both mean and covariance, which the present work extends into a temporal consistency constraint between old and current networks. Finally, Aljundi et al.\u2019s task-free continual learning established the practical regime where task boundaries are unavailable; this setting underscores the need for label- and boundary-agnostic statistics like class means and covariances. By unifying these strands, the paper introduces mean-shift compensation and class-specific covariance calibration as principled, task-agnostic mechanisms to counter semantic drift in CIL.",
