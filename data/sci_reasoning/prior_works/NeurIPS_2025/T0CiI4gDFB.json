  "synthesis_narrative": "ReSim\u2019s core contribution\u2014reliable, controllable simulation of driving scenarios that follow both expert and hazardous non-expert behaviors\u2014emerges at the intersection of action-conditioned video prediction, diffusion-transformer generation, and simulator-enhanced data curation. The action-conditioning thread originates with Oh et al. (2015), which formalized predicting future frames given actions; ReSim retains this principle but scales it to complex real-world driving. Modern diffusion modeling, particularly latent diffusion and DiT, provides the generative fidelity and scalability needed for long-horizon, photorealistic rollouts. Within this backbone, ControlNet-style conditioning demonstrates how to inject multiple structured control signals, a concept ReSim adapts to integrate actions, routes, and other cues to ensure controllability without sacrificing realism. Domain-specific precedents\u2014UniSim and GAIA-1\u2014show that interactive, policy-following driving world models are feasible when trained on large real-world corpora, yet they struggle with rare unsafe maneuvers that are underrepresented in logs. ReSim directly addresses this reliability gap by augmenting real demonstrations with simulator-sourced non-expert data from CARLA, broadening the behavior distribution and enabling faithful hazard-following predictions. By uniting these strands\u2014action-conditioned dynamics, robust diffusion-transformer architectures with effective control injection, and heterogeneous training that includes simulated hazards\u2014ReSim attains reliable open-world simulation suitable for evaluating policies under diverse and challenging driving behaviors.",
