  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution is a precise re-interpretation of the celebrated Long\u2013Servedio impossibility\u2014\u201cnoise defeats all convex boosters\u201d\u2014through the lens of class-probability estimation losses and model capacity. The random classification noise model of Angluin and Laird provides the foundational setting in which both the negative result and the present analysis are posed. Long and Servedio\u2019s construction directly motivates this work: rather than indicting convexity itself, the authors extend the analysis and locate the failure in the restricted model class of linear separators. On the algorithmic side, canonical convex potential boosters such as AdaBoost (Freund & Schapire) and LogitBoost (Friedman, Hastie & Tibshirani) form the primary baselines and exemplify the family of methods purportedly defeated by noise. The paper\u2019s counterpoint is built on modern risk theory for surrogates: Bartlett, Jordan & McAuliffe\u2019s classification-calibration results establish when convex surrogates target Bayes risk, while Reid & Williamson\u2019s framework of proper composite losses and surrogate regret quantifies probability estimation fidelity. Together, these foundations enable the design and analysis of a new, general convex booster that is robust under RCN when paired with sufficiently expressive hypothesis classes. Collins, Schapire & Singer\u2019s Bregman-distance view of boosting supplies the potential-based machinery that the new booster extends, thereby unifying proper-loss\u2013driven probability estimation with general convex boosting beyond linear separators.",
