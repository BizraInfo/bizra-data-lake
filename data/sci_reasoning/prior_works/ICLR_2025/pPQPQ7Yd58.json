  "synthesis_narrative": "Neural Collapse revealed that as training proceeds, deep classifiers\u2019 penultimate features concentrate around class means that form a simplex ETF, aligning with last-layer weights and enabling tight geometric predictions of representations (Papyan et al., 2020). Subsequent analyses extended this behavior beyond cross-entropy classification, showing that square-loss training can also induce collapse-like clustering, thereby connecting the phenomenon to regression settings (Fang et al., 2021). In manipulation, classic visual servoing formalized control as acting on relative pose error signals\u2014particularly their signs and magnitudes\u2014establishing a control-theoretic partition of state space that naturally discretizes into orthants (Hutchinson et al., 1996). End-to-end visuomotor learning operationalized an image encoder feeding an action decoder trained from demonstrations, defining the precise vision-to-action channel whose internal representations can be probed (Levine et al., 2016). In parallel, Transporter Networks emphasized that manipulation can be effectively parameterized by relative spatial displacements between objects and goals, directly elevating relative pose as the central control variable (Zeng et al., 2020). Foundationally, behavior cloning provided the supervised mapping from observations to actions that underlies modern visuomotor policies (Pomerleau, 1989).\nTogether, these works suggest that if visuomotor policies are trained via behavior cloning on tasks parameterized by relative pose, then the encoder\u2019s latent space should organize around control-relevant equivalence classes analogous to neural collapse. The combination of NC\u2019s clustering insight, its MSE-loss extension to continuous outputs, and control theory\u2019s relative-pose partitioning motivates defining REPO-based classes and predicts that discrete-action policies cluster by action labels while continuous-action policies cluster by control-oriented pose categories\u2014precisely the geometry this paper formalizes and empirically validates.",

Inspired by the phenomenon of *neural collapse* (NC) in image classification, we empirically demonstrate the prevalent emergence of a similar *law of clustering* in the visual representation space. Specifically, \n\n- In discrete image-based control (e.g., Lunar Lander), the visual representations cluster according to the natural discrete action labels;\n\n- In continuous image-based control (e.g., Planar Pushing and Block Stacking), the clustering emerges according to ``control-oriented'' classes that are based on (a) the relative pose between the object and the target in the input or (b) the relative pose of the object induced by expert actions in the output. Each of the classes corresponds to one relative pose orthant (REPO).\n\nBeyond empirical observation, we show such a law of",
