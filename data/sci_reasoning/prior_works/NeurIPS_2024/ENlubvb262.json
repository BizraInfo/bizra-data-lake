  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s main advance is a simple proper learner, Perspectron, that PAC-learns large-margin halfspaces under Massart noise with sample complexity ~O((\u03b5\u03b3)^{-2}), matching the best-known rates under random classification noise (RCN) while attaining error \u03b7+\u03b5. This resolves a gap left by earlier Massart-noise works and aligns the difficulty of Massart with RCN in the margin regime. Two lines of prior work directly scaffold this result. First, DGT19 and CKMY20 developed algorithms for Massart noise\u2014DGT19 for margin halfspaces and CKMY20 for generalized linear models (GLMs) with known link\u2014but with worse dependence on \u03b5 and/or \u03b3; they established feasibility yet left open whether Massart could achieve RCN-like optimal rates. Second, recent RCN results such as DDKWZ23 and KITBMV23 achieved the ~O((\u03b5\u03b3)^{-2}) benchmark for margin halfspaces with simple proper procedures, providing both a rate target and a conceptual blueprint that noise need not fundamentally degrade margin-based learnability. Foundationally, Massart and N\u00e9d\u00e9lec (2006) formalized the bounded-noise condition, clarifying what \u03b7+\u03b5 guarantees should mean, while Bartlett, Jordan, and McAuliffe (2006) connected margin-based surrogate optimization to classification risk, supporting the use of simple, proper, margin-driven learners. Building on these, Perspectron closes the complexity gap for Massart halfspaces and extends the improvements to the GLM-with-known-link model introduced by CKMY20, thereby substantially strengthening the state of the art under Massart noise.",
