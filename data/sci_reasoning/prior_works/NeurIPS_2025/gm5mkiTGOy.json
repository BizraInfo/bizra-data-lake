  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014a two-stage theory of Transformer training in which attention parameters first condense (align) and then undergo rank collapse\u2014rests on a tight intellectual lineage. Jacot et al. (2018) provide the linearized, gradient-flow lens (NTK) that enables precise, tractable analysis of early training, which the authors adapt specifically to attention modules. Saxe et al. (2013) demonstrated mode-wise alignment in deep linear networks, directly inspiring the Stage-1 condensation interpretation where asymmetric perturbations systematically steer parameters toward target singular directions. Chizat and Bach (2019) formalized the lazy (small-init) regime; this work builds on and goes beyond that picture by explaining how asymmetric weight perturbations sustain non-degenerate gradients to escape the lazy regime and trigger genuine feature learning in attention. The late-stage behavior is informed by implicit-bias results: Gunasekar et al. (2018) showed gradient descent\u2019s proclivity for low-rank solutions in matrix factorization, which the authors leverage to characterize Stage-2 rank collapse in key-query/value matrices. The theory also addresses long-standing empirical gaps in Transformer interpretability: Michel et al. (2019) and Voita et al. (2019) documented redundancy and prunability of many attention heads; the two-stage dynamics here provide a principled account of how condensation and subsequent rank collapse yield such redundancy. Finally, the connection to collapse phenomena broadly, as in Papyan et al. (2020), motivates a terminal-phase perspective where structural simplification emerges naturally from the training dynamics.",
