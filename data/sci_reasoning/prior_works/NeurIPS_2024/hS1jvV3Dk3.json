  "synthesis_narrative": "The paper\u2019s core contribution\u2014framing prompt optimization for black-box LLMs as localized zeroth-order search over carefully defined input domains\u2014emerges from two lines of prior work. First, prompt methods established that both search and representation crucially shape outcomes. AutoPrompt cast discrete prompt improvement as an optimization problem, while LM-BFF empirically showed that template and verbalizer choices drastically alter few-shot performance. Complementing these, Prompt Tuning introduced continuous prompt representations, reinforcing that the geometry of the search space matters. Collectively, these works motivate the paper\u2019s Insight II: the prompt generation and representation domains strongly affect discoverable optima.\nSecond, recent automatic prompt/instruction methods, such as Instruction Induction, popularized global search\u2014iteratively proposing and scoring many candidate prompts. While effective, these approaches can be query-inefficient and brittle. This sets up the paper\u2019s Insight I: high-quality local optima are abundant and practically advantageous when explored efficiently.\nTo operationalize these insights, the paper draws on zeroth-order optimization foundations from black-box attack literature. ZOO formalized finite-difference gradient estimation without access to model internals, and Ilyas et al. advanced query-efficient evolution strategies. In parallel, Alzantot et al. demonstrated the power of locality-aware edit operations in discrete text spaces. Integrating these ideas, the paper constrains search to well-designed local neighborhoods and applies zeroth-order estimators to reliably climb toward strong local optima, achieving efficient, robust prompt optimization without relying on global exhaustive exploration.",
