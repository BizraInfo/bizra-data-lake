  "synthesis_narrative": "KLASS sits at the intersection of discrete diffusion modeling and iterative masked generation. Its base generative setting follows D3PM, which formalized diffusion in categorical state spaces via masking and denoising transitions; KLASS specifically targets the D3PM-style sampling bottleneck\u2014many slow, static steps\u2014by finalizing stable tokens early. The notion of parallel token unmasking draws direct inspiration from MaskGIT and Mask-Predict, which demonstrated that iterative refinement with confidence-guided revealing can dramatically accelerate masked generation. KLASS advances this idea by replacing heuristic confidence thresholds and fixed schedules with a principled token-level stability metric: the KL divergence between successive posteriors, allowing adaptive, per-token acceptance across steps.\nIn spirit, KLASS also echoes earlier masked-LM generation frameworks such as BERT-as-MRF, which perform iterative token updates; KLASS\u2019s novelty is to operationalize a quantitative stability test (per-token KL) to safely accept multiple tokens in parallel. Relative to fast diffusion samplers like DDIM and to training-based accelerators such as Progressive Distillation, KLASS offers an orthogonal acceleration route: it preserves the original masked diffusion model and sampler but dynamically prunes future computation for tokens deemed converged. Finally, akin to CALM\u2019s per-token, confidence-based early exiting in autoregressive LMs, KLASS leverages a tokenwise decision rule to allocate inference effort\u2014yet grounds it in KL stability rather than raw confidence\u2014yielding robust speedups with maintained or improved quality across text, image, and molecular domains.",
