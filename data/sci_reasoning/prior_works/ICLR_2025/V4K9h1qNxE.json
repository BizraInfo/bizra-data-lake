  "synthesis_narrative": "HyperNetworks established that a compact conditioning signal can generate the parameters of a target network, crystallizing the notion of weight-as-a-function-of-context central to modular computation. Complementing this, work on fast weight programmers showed that attention can be interpreted as dynamically programmed weights, grounding the idea that context (key\u2013query) can set up transient operators applied to values. FiLM demonstrated in practice that a low-dimensional code can modulate downstream computation to enable visual reasoning, highlighting that such codes can be both compact and composable. Mechanistic studies of transformers uncovered induction heads\u2014reusable attention circuits that implement algorithmic subtasks\u2014suggesting that attention already contains modular building blocks that can be recombined. Analyses of in-context learning further argued that models encode task-specific inner-loop updates in their hidden states, implying an internal task code that steers computation without changing persistent weights. Finally, SCAN provided a concrete formulation and evaluation of compositional generalization as recombination of learned primitives.\nTaken together, these works reveal a consistent picture: contextual signals can generate or modulate operators (hypernetworks/fast weights), compact codes can control complex reasoning (FiLM), and transformers house reusable attention circuits and task codes (induction heads, ICL). The natural next step is to make this implicit mechanism explicit by treating multi-head attention itself as a hypernetwork that emits a key\u2013query\u2013specific operator on values, to extract the low-dimensional latent that specifies subtasks, and to test whether enriching the generated operator (e.g., making the value network nonlinear) strengthens the recomposition needed for systematic generalization.",
